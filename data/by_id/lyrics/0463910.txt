Joe, ain't you my buddy thee?
Stay with me when I fall and die
Always thought you'd come rushing in
To clear the shit out of my eye

[Verse 2: PJ Harvey]
Joe, ain't you my buddy thee?
Lay my enemies out in lines
Come in close and I'll wash your feet
With my hair I'd mop them dry

[Chorus: Rob Ellis]
With my hair I'd mop them dry
Something over there I do not like
There's no use in wondering

[Verse 3: PJ Harvey]
Joe, you be my buddy please
In this hell and dead-lock time
When I'm trussed in that headache tree
Cut me down with your silver knife

[Chorus: Rob Ellis]
Cut me down with your silver knife
Something over there I do not like
There's no use in wonderingYou might also like
