If I hit 'em high hit 'em high hit 'em high
Then you hit 'em low hit 'em low hit 'em low

[Verse 1: Karess]
I got that ill shit locked, I'm gonna grill this pot, like "Yo chill bitch, watch!"
My dro dealers weed buds fill ziplocs, and that's real shit, I'm higher than a building top
Never yield or stop, not too many niggas match with Karess
Nasty as heck, rocking Air Maxes and sweats
Tacky and don't give a fuck if I match when I dress
Nigga, the bitch said my raps get her wet, i dont have to impress
The way I'm spittin' slay my victims and I'm staying lifted
Playing bitches like a mother fucking gaming system
I got bars like im tryna fucking make a prison
Player pimpin', I'm the reason why your dame is missin'
Paper gettin', on my hustling shit
Grimey nigga, walk up to your bitch, straight puffing a stick
Better be raw if you got something to spit
If not, you're getting punched in the lip
Man, thats just how it is, the spot loud when the reefer is talkin'
The leaf that I'm knockin', got these hoes wheezing and coughin'
I stay with a forty bottle and some weed in my pocket
See, I'm a problem, beating me ain't even an option, bitch

[Hook]

Sipping on a forty while I’m writing my raps
Enlightening cats, to the fact I’m nice with the tracks
Crack a cipher that’s packed, and then I’m quick to ether kids
Plus I got ya bitch yelling baby like Bieber did
Half you kids spit the simplest raps
That’s why I shrug em off instead of giving em daps
I’m just chillin at the finish where the winners relax
You at the back of the pack, what kind of limits he have?
Pay no mind to fashion, rocking hoodies and jeans
Never aiming for the fame, it ain't as good as it seems
While ya chasing chips, we’re erasing ya clique
Dropping videos that keep your eyes glued to the screen
Every time I leave the booth, it’s looking like a murder scene
Cooking dope up in the lab, my crew is steady serving fiends
Addicted to medical edibles, I’m always burning green
A master rapper every syllable you heard is clean

[Verse 3: Thr33]
Reporting live from the sky, it's that nigga they love to hate
And i can't remember a face, only dough to accumulate
I'm a manifestation of light, here to set you fucks straight
Fuck hate, I eliminate everything they generate
Most of these cowards is sweet and sour like lemonade
Looking at the Looney lame game like, "Should I penetrate?"
Innovate, penetrate your bitch, she hyperventilates
So many trees around me, it's a hid away, get away
Cause ho, I stay lit like Independence Day
And my niggas keep the cookie like a fucking Christmas tray
Coinciding my coalition, exceeding the pace
Like, "Nigga fuck a million, I want to be Bill Gates"
Wah-lah in your face, now you met a magician
Wiped out, pearing at the tide just like the crimson
I confide in my visions, that's why I'm never trippin'
Plus a nigga keep getting dome like beauticians
[Hook]

[Verse 4: Mike Bars]
My shit's obscene, foul mouthed, you're Listerine
I'm a diss machine, nasty, you're like Mr. Clean
I spit supreme, with a thousand an hour salary
That's why they kiss the crown, not the ground when they bow down to me
A lunatic, doing gruesome shit, a fugitive
And the flame I spit's the only thing keeping my Cuban lit
I'm too legit, you ride around with a beauty kit
Dude or chick? Wait, you're a man? Damn, that's a puny dick
Fuck with me, you're gonna need a doctor
With more cuts and scratches than DJ Hoppa
I'm a psycho, you don't want to pick a fight with Michael
If you'd like to, I'll go get my AS50 Sniper Rifle
Yeah, and I might just do it again
And bruise up your skin, depending on the mood that I'm in
So quick, take a flick, let me get this booze off my chin
And you'll see a star before it's dark, like a hallucinogen (Say Cheese!)
See I'll be whippin', while you kick it in your dad's old Jeep
That's why you're trippin' and your bitch been on my nads all week
Listen, I'mma stick my dick into her vag so deep
That when I finish, it'll drip, and make her asshole leak
Y'all don't know who I am
Cause Tony Stark said if I dress as Clark Kent
They won't know that I'm Superman
Blam, so holler at me if you need somthing
I'll be on the toilet in my cape, straight mean mugging
[Hook]
