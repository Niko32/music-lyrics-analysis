It doesn't pay to try
All the smart boys know why
It doesn't mean I didn't try
I just never know why
Feel so cold and all alone
'Cause baby, you're not at home
And when I'm home
Big deal, I'm still alone

[Verse 2]
Feel so restless, I am
Beat my head against a pole
Try to knock some sense
Down in my bones
And even though they don't show
The scars aren't so old
And when they go
They let you know

[Chorus]
You can't put your arms around a memory
You can't put your arms around a memory
You can't put your arms around a memory
Don't try, don't try
You might also like[Verse 3]
You're just a bastard kid
And you got no name
Cause you're living with me
We're one and the same
And even though they don't show
The scars aren't so old
And when they go
They let you know

[Chorus]
You can't put your arms around a memory
You can't put your arms around a memory
You can't put your arms around a memory
Don't try, don't try
You can't put your arms around a memory
You can't put your arms around a memory
You can't put your arms around a memory
Don't try, don't try
