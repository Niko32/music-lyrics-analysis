I sat alone for an hour and thought
I know I broke the rules
I knew it there on the spot
But what I did was alright
And I knew all along
In spite of the warning I got
Cause this time, Dad, you're wrong

I'll prove it to you
No, I'm not just a fool
I'm not just a fool
No, I'll prove it to you

Well, I can't tell you why
Might not know why until after it's through
But at least I've got to try
And then you might understand too
But love is why I go back
Like I knew all along
The fact is I even love you
Cause this time, Dad, you're wrong

I'll prove it to you
I'm not just a fool
I'm not just a fool
No, I'll prove it to youYou might also like
