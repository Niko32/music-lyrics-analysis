Bachelorette, you climb on rooftops and you
Bachelorette, you can turn dust into champagne
You even remembered his name
Bachelorette, the braves you painted pink for
Bachelorettes, you tried to show him that he can
But you can never rush a man

[Chorus]
You must remember
You’re a car girl, you’re a star girl, you are at the door
The tide will turn
There’s a window, there’s a window

[Verse 2]
Yeah, da-dum, you climb on rooftops and you
Mmm-dum, you tried to show him that he can
But you can never rush a man, no
Say, bachelorette, the things you do girls to your
Bachelorettes, you thought that inside it is
And that I lie di di di di

[Chorus]
You must remember
You’re a car girl, you’re a star girl, you are at the door
The tide will turn
There’s a window, there’s a window
You might also like[Outro]
Bachelorette, you fly alone now and you cry sometimes
There’s nothing like it in the world
You’ll go to Paris on your own
Oh, just bachelorette, you climb on rooftops and you
Bachelorette, you can turn dust into champagne
You even lie di di di di
