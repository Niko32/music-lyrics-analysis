Say that you love me, even if it's not true
And say that this storm is just passing through
Baby, tell me you're not leaving
It's just the rainy season

[Verse 2]
The air's getting heavy and we both know why
So dance one more dance and tell one more lie
Baby, let's keep make believing
That it's just the rainy season

[Chorus]
We're taking on water
Drop after drop, we're destroying this house
And each other
So make it stop
Make it stop

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
We're taking on water
Yeah, drop after drop, we're destroying this house
And each other, yeah
Please, make it stop
You might also like[Outro]
Wish I could just say it and words were enough
To keep you from being the one giving up
Like the sky letting go for no reason
Yeah, in the rainy season
Baby, tell me you're not leaving
It's just the rainy season
It's just the rainy season
It's just the rain
Yeah, it's just the rain
It's just the rainy season
