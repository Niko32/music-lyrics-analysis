I keep turning out
For sure are very basic
I live without that doubt,
Expressing how I feel
Many things I`ve done or said
Any quirky story
That may pop into my head.

At times I ramble on
Far longer than my intent
When I feel out of control
But have enjoyed the time I spent,
I`ll never profess to be a poet
I just gather up a rhyme
If they hold your attention

I thank you for your time.
