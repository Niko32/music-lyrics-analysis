Across the town tonight
I saw a figure and I saw a bright white
Started walking the wrong way home
Knew I was lost, I learned a little and at no cost
How we're feeling by the end, left us cold enough
It's just another picture of, picture of you
What am I, what am I supposed to do?
It's just another place, I went to with you
What am I, what am I supposed to do?
Everything was said
But would you stop and listen
Because it's heart we're missing
We'll get ourselves back home
Though we're still lost
We learned a great deal and at no cost
How we're feeling by the end, left us cold enough
For some reason, I hit the floor when I got in
It's just another picture of, picture of you
What am I, what am I supposed to do?
It's just another place, I went to with you
What am I, what am I supposed to do?You might also like
