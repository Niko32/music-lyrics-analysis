I'm a predefined commodity
The marauder mill needs an unpolluted grist
I can feel the strain around my wrist
We're in human farms and the scythe is cutting carefully
Reaping the radical
We're in human farms and the blight is striking randomly
It's reforming me
When the sedition's growing - when you force me to the front
When you say we are the product, i'm the vanguard of the hunt
When the sedition's growing - when you force me to the front
When you say we are the product, i'm the vanguard of the hunt
The automation-swell has ever-tarnished the crop
The ravenous reform will never stop
The fattening proceeds of trade activity
And we live life like a dead foundry
We're in human farms and the scythe is cutting carefully
Reaping the radical
We're in human farms and the blight is striking randomly
It's reforming me
An' shock it...
I got the diligence to motivate - i got the mind-span to reallocate
The most ferocious freedom known to me - is better than the safest slavery
Ah rake the land - the diagram is hyperbole
Ah cut the stand - the reaper sure is on a role
An' shock it...
