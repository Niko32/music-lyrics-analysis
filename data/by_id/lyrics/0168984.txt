You peep that?
Women prolly think my fuckin dick hits my kneecap
The way I walk, world’s most confident man
Real recognize real that’s my marketing plan
You diggin me? It’ll be my delivery not my chilvary
The ngga in me’s considerin switchin to polygamy
Black mormon, 3 wives up in the back
Warmin up a plate, fckin til its late you know where that’s goin
Treatin life like it’s Baskin Robbins
Is a path synonymous with tastin flavors of the massive problems
Give me the opposite of Tiger Woods’ wife
The good life, God forbid my chick turn to Suge Knight
Death Row style, talking bout my dollar like she Creflow now
While the rest go “wow!”
Fuck that, that’s a heavy cost many pennies lost
Lipstick on my collar? What the fuck that’s spaghetti sauce
On the real older women be the ready type
Throw my chips in time to mix it up with Betty White
Why not? It’s the thrill of the chase
Type a nigga always get a drink spilled in my face
‘cause if you frontin it ain't nothing I get rid of you, thanks
Then I show you your replacement like you Vivian Banks
25 years on this earth
Do you have any idea what I’m worth?
Young Hathaway, rapidly blowin the map away
Opposing me? you better tuck a rosary the Catholic way
Our Father who art in heaven, I won’t mislead my breathren
Leave rap to be a reverend
Still sinnin, lead by example blowin an L
Ice in my ear in case a nigga’s goin to hell
Meet with the devil, not a fckin minute I waste
Sellin hell back to him for condominium space
Earn my back still I’m scorch
I don’t Sajack, my wheel of fortune
Got me spinnin for a bigger portion
Willy Wonka ain’t my sponsor
Ain’t no golden tickets I was built to conquer
Hope you feel the opera
Fat lady singin like she came with Silk the Shokker
Ain't No Limit when I jump up in it know I killt it properYou might also like
