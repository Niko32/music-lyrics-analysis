I'm giving in, sinking to the bottom of them blue depths
Cleanse my body of the desperate stench of the mess that you left
Ain't swimming much but I do tread, I'm tired of this movement
I'm thinking bout sleeping treatin this ocean as my new bed
Bet you two step to the rhythm of that wave crash
Press that pedal accelerate and make it fade black
I pray that satan and waiting on me for payback
Ashamed of the place my fate's at, chasing a break to change that
I found a heartbeat in the back of this carseat
Bloody blackened charred meat that got hacked and the passion scarred me
But it's still beaten at the pace of a marching army
You never said I'm sorry yet that no longer harms me
This ties a noose, bulletproof in a black suit
I wanna ask you to straighten a couple facts too
But it's been check mate, so my last move's
To swim from this shore that I'm never coming back toYou might also like
