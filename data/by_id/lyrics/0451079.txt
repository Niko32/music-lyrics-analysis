Five feet high and three feet wide
No one's ever eaten the whole thing and survived
It comes with a bucket of ranch on the side
It's the Ultimate Sandwich (Dear God!)
The Ultimate Sandwich (Oh shit!)

Its taste could drive a lesser man insane
Served on wheat bread made from thirty thousand separate grains
It was made by a demon in his kitchen of pain
It's the Ultimate Sandwich (Sweet Christ!)
The Ultimate Sandwich (Fuck yeah!)

[Chorus]
(Whoa-ho) It's a shit-ton of chicken on a dickload of ham
An explosion of clams
(Whoa-ho) Top that fucker with yams
Now just add panther, bear meat, and duck
And you've got a sandwich that I'd like to fuck
I mean eat, what?

[Verse 2]
The ultimate sandwich uses weapons-grade ham
To awaken your passions, make you feel like a man
It's as dense as an anvil and as big as a raft
Its sun-dried tomatoes grip the sides of my shaft
You might also likeTopped with man's hottest peppers on the world's coldest cuts
It's time to get sexy, no ifs, ands, or buts
As I thrust deep inside it, bacon grazes my nuts
It's the Ultimate Sandwich (Oh tits!)
The Ultimate Sandwich (Hot balls!)

[Chorus]
(Whoa-ho) It's a legend of lunches, the lord of buffets
I could slam it for days
(Whoa ho) It sets my patties ablaze
It's time to stuff my stuff in its stuffing
Ninja Brian, for practice, I nailed your blueberry muffins

[Outro]
Oh, but not the one you're eating right now, Brian
All right, I fucked that muffin too
You gonna judge me? You gonna be a Judgey Jason about this?
Ah! You have cleaved my entire body in half
