Oh, no
And you can't sell empty promises
'Cause folks these days
Just ain't buying no more (no, no)
Everybody knows the score
But there's something you can do
When Jesus opens the door for you
Just let His light come shining through, yeah

What can heal a dying world
Love can make it happen
There's no end to what His love can do
What can turn His light on in the dark
Whoa-whoa, love can make it happen
Open up and let His love flow through
Just let His love flow through

You know that love can make it happen

Now maybe we could save the entire world
If we pick up love and put religious weapons down
'Cause sometimes we get so wrapped up
In tradition, restrictions, divisions, they abound
Is there any love to be found
Oh, we can save a dying world today
If we humble ourselves and pray
We can make a way
