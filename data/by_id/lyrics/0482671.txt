Who could it be?
Lofty
Rhymes more vast than the depths of the sea

[Basehead]
One for the hashblock, two for the Zu
Cap to the back, hoes know what it do

[Lofty]
More game than an emulator, fuck a hater
I'm all about my paper, hashish vapors

[Basehead]
Stroking on some honeys, the kid they call the Basehead
Got so much dome that the kid might be brain-dead

[Lofty]
Lofty, hash on deck
Basshead fresh
Pocket full of X
Mashing on your ex
You're lookin at the next
She want a nigga like Lofty, no regrets
Yes, Metro Zu coming thru
Bitches blowing on the damn dick like kazoos
Choose, a nigga like me and you'll be
Making my bread an extension of me
You might also like[Basehead]
Came from a city with an ocean breeze
Skyline built off coke and keys
Basshead keeps 'em all on their knees
With Zu in a [?] blowing trees
Psychic sounds
Ass by the pound
Ounces in the back
Dodging swine around the town
