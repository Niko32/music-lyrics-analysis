I roll with the best
All this nikkas talk shit
All they want is a feature
Im up on this goods and
I'm looking fresh
And i grind with ma team every night
Nikkas they wanna be close and i'm cutting em off
They cuming so hard i ain't selling a peace of soul
I fuck what you say
Put a dick in ur mouth
And i roll with the best and
Your girl is my groupie
Most of this rappers we never go feature
The shit that we sayin is
Simple and clear
I roll around we killin we ballin we chasin that guap
All of this nikkas stay ready for war
Coz i'm loading ma gunz and all of ma cliques go bangYou might also like
