And someone beat me to the punch

I was only there 'cause I did not care
And I love to watch your friends

What you said to me
I could not believe
It was too much too late too soon

And I broke down there in that folding chair
When I saw you walk by

I will never be the friend you had in me
And there's no cure I know for having trouble letting go
And I am
And I am again

It was like a wave of time washed over me and left me dry
You were like a part of me I never wanted to see die
Five times I realized and always knowing that someday
I would sit with my hands tied and watch someone
Give you away

And I broke down there
In that folding chair
It was too much pain
It was too much to bear
And I hope you sleep well tonight
And I'll think of you as I turn out the light
You might also likeAnd I will
And I will again

And I broke down there
Like a folding chair
It was too much pain
It was too much to bear
And I hope you sleep well tonight
And I'll think of us as I turn out the light

And I will
And I will again
