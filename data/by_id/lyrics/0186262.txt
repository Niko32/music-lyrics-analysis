Oh you better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 1]
He's making a list (Making a list)
He's checking it twice (Checking it twice)
He's gonna find out who's naughty and nice
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So you better be good for goodness sake
(You better be good for goodness sake)

[Chorus]
Oh, you better watch out
You better not cry (Not cry)
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town (To town)
Santa Claus is coming to town (To town)
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Chorus]
Oh you better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
