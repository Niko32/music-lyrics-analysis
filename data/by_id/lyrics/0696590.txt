Let’s find a place to escape
The prettiness of your face
Keeping my heart in place
Avoiding darkness, the way you are flawless
Kisses from you so sinful, and girl I’m falling
Caught in the heat of the moment, and girl I’m all in
Nothing to waste
You’re luxurious with expensive taste
The liquor your fave’
You party all night till’ the sun in the sky
You feeling the bass, all on your skin while the vibe of it all, is beating within
The rhythm of it, you feeling so bliss
We feeling so good, nothing can diminish it like…

Chorus:

We could party all night
From dawn to moonlight, from moonlight to sunrise
We can do it all night
Pick a place and we’ll go there
Make you feel like you belong there
Don’t worry for you, I’ll take care
Tonight’s the night; you float to the sky and do what you want too
No rules to this, for the life you live, you do what you want to, you do what you want to
We can party all night
From dawn to moonlight, from moonlight to sunrise
We can do it all night

Make you, make you feel good…
I just wanna make you feel good
F-F-F-F-F-Feel good
I just wanna make you feel good
Make you feel good…
I just wanna make you feel good
I just wanna make you feel good...

Jahail:

Loving you is brainless
The eyes of mine are naked
Loving you selfish
Tell me how to break this
The love for you the love for me
The way it brings the happiness (x2)
