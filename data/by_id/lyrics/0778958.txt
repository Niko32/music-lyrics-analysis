See the shadow walking in the dark
Here she comes
She's all in black
Long hair flowing down her back
Gotta get her out of my mind

Honey, I wanna kiss you
Honey, Give me your head
Honey, I wanna kiss you
Baby, let me waste away upon your tender lips

Oh she loves blood and honey
She's got the devil in her eyes
(She's got the devil in her eyes.)
She loves blood and honey
They say nobody survives a deadly kiss

Oh she loves blood and honey
She's got the devil in her eyes
(She's got the devil in her eyes)
She loves blood and honey
Devil is her love and it's the kiss of death to love he

Now she's lonely walking down your street
She's looking for a bite to eat
When she loves she really leaves her mark
You might also likePain in her eyes and death in her smile
It's a one-way-trip to hell!
Give in to desire and she'll put your soul on fire
Velvety eyes and pearly skin
When she'll knock at your door
Your night will begin

Oh
I wanna kiss you baby
I wanna honey
I wanna kiss you baby
Got to kill the lady who loves blood and honey
Oh she loves blood and honey
She loves blood and honey

Honey, I wanna kiss you honey
Give me your head
Oh she loves blood and honey
