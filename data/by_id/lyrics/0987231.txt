Over again, it plays
I'm not scared to face the wreckage of my younger ways
Every little thing you do
Is measured by the damage that it does to you

[Pre-Chorus]
You can screw me around
You can swallow me down

[Chorus]
Well, I don't really know why
All we do is get high
Guess I'd rather just save my breath
The world is just a time bomb
Everyone is dead wrong
And all this weight is on my head
My head

[Verse 2]
Everyone you think you know
It turned to something different only yesterday
All of us need to choose
It's easier to give in than it is to lose

[Pre-Chorus]
They can blow up our head
They can leave me for dead
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, I don't really know why
All we said is "Goodbye"
Guess I'd rather just save my breath
The world is just a time bomb
Everyone is dead wrong
And all this weight is on my head
My head
My head
My head

[Bridge]
Everything takes so long
Everyone waits so long

[Chorus]
Well, I don't really know why
All we do is get high
Guess I'd rather just save my breath
The world is just a time bomb
Everyone is dead wrong
And all this weight is on my head
My head
The world is just a time bomb
Everyone is dead wrong
And all this weight is on my head
My head
My head
My head
