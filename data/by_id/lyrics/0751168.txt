Riding horses with white hair
Everyone was bewitched
And they called each others friends

But soon the words turned bullets
And the rivers were dyed red
A few spoke with wisdom
But nobody seemed to care

The beast now is out for its feast
Leaving the scraps full of

Tears that learnt to fly
When the absent-minded guns were loaded
Just an old and ruined face proud of its stupidity
Fears that grow inside

When the accomplished men pillars tremble
There's no better way to escape
Than creeping through the land of hate

The sisters now are gone
But their sons spread the seeds
Hybrid born entities that hide their sins with guilt
You might also likeA slight breeze surrounding
No sign of life outside
What others left standing now calling open wide
