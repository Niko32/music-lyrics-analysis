Of all the wants and hungers (The wants and hungers)
The lust of love, a brute desire
The ledge of life goes under (The ledge of life goes under)
Divide the dream into the flesh
Kaleidoscope and candle eyes (Kaleidoscope and candle eyes)
Empty winds scrape on the soul
But never stop to realize (Never stop to realize)

Animal whisperings
Intoxicate the night (Intoxicate the night)
Hypnotize the desperate
Slow-motion light (Slow-motion light)
Wash away into the rain
Blood, milk, and sky (Blood, milk, and sky)
Hollow moons illuminate
And beauty never dies (Never dies)

Running wild, running blind (Running wild, running blind)
I breathe the body deep (I breathe the body deep)
1,000 years beside myself (1,000 years beside myself)
I do not sleep (I do not sleep)
Seduce the world, it never screams (Seduce the world, it never screams)
Dead water lies (Dead water lies)
Ride the only one who knows (Ride the only one who knows)
Beauty never dies (Beauty never dies)
(Never dies窶年ever dies)
(Never dies窶年ever dies)
