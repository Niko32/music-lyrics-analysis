Who is friends
With my French teacher's stepson
Sebastian
A very nice gentleman

He seems to know me
But i can't remember him
Good god forgive me
I'm out of my element

And i can't seem to keep them all straight
I've forgotten which people i like
And which people i hate
And i'm waiting for someone to shake me and say
Hey bitch
Your wish is my command
Just smile and nod
We'll under-
Standing in front of the sink
I'm pretending to wink
At pretend paparazzi
Who hide in the chemicals

From every locket
Behind every curtain
Their lenses ensure that I look lost in thought
Yet approachable
You might also likeBut i can't seem to keep them all straight
I've forgotten which ones i should skip
And which ones i should take
And i'm waiting for someone to shake me and say
Hey bitch
Don't quit
You're almost dead
Don't give up now
Make friends instead of going out
Go home
Instead of getting dressed go back to bed

There is a voice on the phone
Who's convinced i'm alone
And I've called because I'm greedy
And looking for sympathy

He seems to like me
But i can't relate
I would like to get closer
But christ all the time it takes

And i can't seem to keep myself straight
I've forgotten which habits to hide
And which habits to fake
And i'm waiting for someone to shake me and say
Hey bitch
Nice tits
You're broke but then
You're rich in love
You're great in bed
You'll see the world
You'll knock 'em dead
And all the thick books that you've read
Will count for nothing in the end
