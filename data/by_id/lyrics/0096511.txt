Paradise on the top floor happily livin'
Throwing cash to the kids balcony pool swimmin'
Couple iceys on my neck couple women on my belt
Few milli in the bank only buy never sell
These dreams I never even imagined
Success is a goal I always thought could happen
Just wanna change the world help some people out
Make music for the people so the world knows what I'm bout
Been six months since I started this rap biz
But fame ain't work the same for all of us rap kids
Some homies been blowing up meanwhile I been waitin'
Barely hit 500 views it's alright I'll be patient
Friends tell me I'm improvin' keep doing what I'm doin'
Random comments positivity prevents me from losin'
Proving to myself that I don't need the wealth
They stopped my ads twice at least I got my health
Every day this music's constantly on my mind
24/7 without sleep constantly on my grind
I've put in work for this which is perfectly fine
Cuz I still dream I'mma make it and it just takes time
Rhymes the suffix to my name
Spitfire's all I do pounding verses for the game
But my words flow like water into your brain
So I'm Hurricane Sandy the way I make it rain
Still dream about that record signing
Make a career out of it all by just rhyming
Songs and videos that fans think are engaging
Too bad I ain't there yet and times are changing
[Verse 2: Spitfire]
You might also likeY'all thought I was done quick? Well I ain't even done yet
Working extra hard and I still don't run this
Every time I'm close I get it snatched away
Clock goes tick tock still waiting for my day
This nightmare I've entered those days I remember
When I tasted my dreams woke up felt dismembered
Seen them rise above me don't think they deserve it
Left at the bottom struggling and workin'
Been criticized and hated minimized degraded
Wrote this verse 2 AM Monday night still ain't made it
Been lied to time wasted lost verses lost faces
Tell myself I'm famous but damn it I hate this
Barely anyone cares enough to try and help
Knocked down on the ground real pain I've felt
Got back on my feet just to start it all over
Pushed me to the limit won't let it be over
Stressed out by school and music both together
My passion's for hip hop could write rhymes forever
But no cash and no fame means my raps just so lame
See I'm just a no name tryna join this flow game
But I could be left alone with no one by my side
Turn nightmares into dreams this life I will fight
Work hard to achieve everything that I need
Cuz I ain't stoppin' till success is all that I bleed
