Magically sparking thoughts, mind gold
Now replacing the mask, uncovering the blindfold
Twirling towards destiny, from what I know
Can be a tricky thing
A wild trip to endure
An incredible trip that’s for sure
Something not to ignore
An adventure to explore
Perhaps a way to soar
And more and more
How, how enchanting

[Verse 2: Ishmael]
Fine and brown, divine
No straight lines, just thick and round
Shapes, cakes and pies
Konjo moon eyes to which I dive down
Round, but ooh so alive
So I push it 'til I hear that black sound arise
Resound, ooh it’s warmer at the bottom
It’s deeper, she’s a keeper and she got 'em
The sisters at the free lunch program taught 'em
Summer went to spring time, follow autumn
Come on you don’t pimp her, King love simpler
Mind your temper, don’t whimper
And prevent her from the devil's penchant of
Undressing and caressing and
Possessing and oppressing
Unlessen the tress is the enchant
That’s why I’m fuckin' with her beat, buckin' heat
Ducking so as to breathe them that I keep
But nothing here retreat
Retweet that

The black side of magic, the darkest night
Following drinking gourds thinking a gorgeous flight
The black keys us, plinking the chords just right
The black Jesus, meaning of course he's white
I took a course in white, I had to force the bite
I think of Orson Wells, then I divorce myself
I ate the meklah fruit, I fell in love with blue's
Then pound the war beat drum, we fought and danced no shoes
And never mind the ships, we time travel in nightmares
If you in tune with moons, she right here
A goon who blooms and swoons, you might hear
Boo boom tick tick boom boom, it's quite clear
Zounds and s'bloods, floating on cardboard floods
But we don't harbor much, we keep on marching but
All of this marching sucks, I think of Archie Bunk
The black and white is skunk, we tried and died in funk
