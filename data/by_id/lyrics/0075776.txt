I'm kinda angry you could tell it by my backdrop
I see this girl bout - one terminal over
But she talkin' on the phone I cannot approach her
She looking so fine by the way that she walk
And you could tell what's on her mind by the way that she talk
Now we get to conversing, she tells me how she's livid
With the stupid half job the airways were givin'
Listen - I tell her I relate
I got my bags in California 24 hours late
But I switch the game, by switching lanes
I said my is name Dedrick, you finish this exchange

She said her name was Francesca
Francesca

Now we talkin' bout life and the times
What she's doin with hers and what I'm doin' with mine
I told her I'm in college but I flew out for music
She's into the politics and I think thats the coolest
Hittin' it off and laughing, having us a blast
I'm just there thinking this is not gone last
And just as I thought, the boardin line formed
She stepped onto the plane and forever she was gone

Goneâ€¦
