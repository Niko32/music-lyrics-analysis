Late is the hour for those that walk in the dark
Through the land floats a mist
Its mystical presence gives shelter for those who don't sleep
The moon is bright, it shines so strong
It seems so peaceful watching everyone
There's something moving deep in the mist
The ones awaken, those that will never rest
Eyes that watch every move
Driven by forces unknown to emerge and to feed
Listen to the master's call
Fear of obedience will push them and hunger so strong
Stay inside lock the doors and cellars
Never mind the sounds that you may hear
Say your prayers grab a crucifix
Come now let us in
In the night there are shadows floating
All for real or the mind just playing tricks?
Say your prayers grab a crucifix
Come now you will let us in
Burning pain through the vain
Kill for peace, an easy sacrifice
Into the scene of a spectral vision
There comes a tide that is never ending
Whispering call from a new dimension
Bent through the ages and times
Times, times
Like a piece from a secret story
They are here the fear that we forgot
Close the doors and lock your windows
Uninvited guest
