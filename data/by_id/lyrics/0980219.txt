I was a human being
What good in me?
I guess I'm only human
Horrible as it seems

It's better than a ghost
It's better than a robot
It's better than a demon
Maybe even better than a dog or a tree

I see your mouth
It seems to be moving
And I hear the sounds you make
I guess they must be words
They don't mean a thing

It doesn't take much
To string some words together
Throw em all around
Someone will believe them
You might even believe them yourselfYou might also like
