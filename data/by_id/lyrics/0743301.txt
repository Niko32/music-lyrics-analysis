Ain't no shame in the game boy
Use to move things, yeah we us to slang boy
Yeah that money won't a thing boy
On the block boy is where we got our name boy

[VERSE 1: TEY BOOGIE]
Yeah we really was there
Mixing with the pot crack smoke in the air
Writing down my life yeah this based on me
Based on us, we get it by any means
I remember days we was in the jefferson
Right round the corner Mosby Court veteran
My daddy straight from Whitcomb running shit as usual
My name still ring man you know we got the pull dog

[HOOK 2X: TEY BOOGIE]
Ain't no shame in the game boy
Serving things boy is how we got our name boy
Yeah that money won't a thing boy
Use to move things, just to see the green boy

[VERSE 2: TEY BOOGIE]
We moving to different places
Pop got his whole team running base bitch
Meth got a sick squad as well and when the sqaud got knocked
Ain't nobody never tell and that's including me
I ain't open my mouth
This the first time telling y'all what we all about
Now back to me, I built my lil squad too
Just a bunch of goon niggas that ain't got no shit to loose
When I think about the money I remember them days
I told you from the jump I'm stuck dead in my ways
We was playing with the devil, doing that to get paid
I was right on the block where Lil P got laid
Trying to stay right but that shit keep fucking with me
Bitches playing games, hoping they get lucky with me
I play to win, you play and loose
And when I spit it's the truth, I'll show you how we do
Hole up, bring it back y'all get sixteen more
When opportunity don't knock I'm kicking down that door
Bussin' on your block, spittin' out pure crack
Y'all can leave it up to me to bring that street shit back
Do this shit for my niggas
Do this shit for my soldiers
Cause that time don't and we only get older
And that money keep moving, Ima' keep on chasin'
Go through the bullshit just to get this paper

Get your note pads out
Cause when I spit it you listen, throw the free lessons out
I was right on the corner where EJ made a drop
That was my main nigga, now he all locked up
Think you know a nigga naw you don't know a nigga
Flow cold nigga I'm not trying to boast nigga
Bitches love a nigga, no it's not another nigga
I'm not them other niggas, man I'm way above them niggas
