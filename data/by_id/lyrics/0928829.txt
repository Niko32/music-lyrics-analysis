We crawled a thousand vicious miles
Swam oceans filled with sharks at sundown left them with the tide
Escaped, our R.I.P. wood beds
A chillin' thought of getting caught gives cardiac arrest
Time's up, we better run away, before the night closes in
And my bones shakey, shakey, shake
Time's up, we better run away, before the night catches us, like it does every other day
We scaled the greatest of great walls, dodged arrows, played tennis cannonball
And every time I looked inside you I saw honesty
And honestly I'd have to say you're the perfect company
Time's up we better run away, before the night closes in
And my bones shakey, shakey, shake
Time's up we better run away, before the night catches us, like it does every other day
Time's up. We better run away
Before the night closes in. Like it does every other dayYou might also like
