Yeah

[Verse 1]
I want drugs, I want booze
I wanna mess with anything I like to use
I want to spend, a ton of cash
I want a fancy car that I can crash

[Chorus]
But I want you like I never wanted anything else before
I want you like I never wanted anything else before
Yeah

[Verse 2]
I want control, I love to fight
With anyone who bugs me and I got the right
So hear me now, I wanna be clear
Ever since I met you I want you near

[Chorus]
'Cos I want you like I never wanted anything else before
I want you like I never wanted anything else before
Yeah

[Hook]
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you
You might also like[Chorus]
I want you like I never wanted anything else before
I want you like I never wanted anything else before
Yeah

[Hook]
I want you
I want you
I want you
I want you

[Chorus]
But I want you like I never wanted anything else before
But I want you like I never wanted anything else before
