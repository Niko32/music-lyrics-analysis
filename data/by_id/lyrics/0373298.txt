Gimmi head for my bread
You heard what i said

And do it in the Benz
And pop a three sixty

Verse 2: Hooks Amero
My chain so big
Can't pop my collar
Swag so clean
Like no other
Bitches Bow Down
They call me Dali Lama
I talk so much shit
You can't fuck with the Grammar
Im rocking pretty color sneakers
And skinny jeans
Im stacking so much paper
That my thumbs are green
AMG Benz got me feeling so mean
Frequency so loud
Yo they think im harping
My swag is the future
They think im warping
My pops told me
To rock your white tees
You pretty color sneakers
And your skinny jeans
The bitches love the taste
Just keep them on they knees
A hater wanna hate?
Just let him be
They hating on the tape
But they got it on repeat
Watch them die slowly
With the envy
Im the player of the game
Im the MVP
