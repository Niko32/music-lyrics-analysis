Hurry up Shugga gotta check it out
The old strong wish is roaring inside me
To poke the fuckin` wound and let it bleed
I'm the degradation of the 'NEW SALVATION'
I'm the panic button of your liberty
I'm getting closer to the beast, oh, yes indeed
Feed my anger, burry my grief
You call me a lazy drone
Gotta crack your throne
I know you want me gone
You wish I’d better be gone
Shugga boogie-woogie horned red head
He's here to present the brand new dance
Hurry up honey don’t you hesitate
Come on babe wanna ride this hot V8
Can't cut that cancer with the rusty blunt knife
Can't fill your filthy hole with my riot soul
I think I forgot this simple feeling
I need the overdrive to get the thrill, yeah!
You call me a lazy drone
Gotta crack your throne
I know you want me gone
You wish I’d better be gone
Cheap thrill overdrive
With the horned head tonight!You might also like
