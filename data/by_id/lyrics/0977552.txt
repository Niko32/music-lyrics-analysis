You said the world was magic, I was wide-eyed and laughing
We were dancing up to the bright side
Forget about your ego, forget about your pride
And you will never have to compromise

[Chorus]
And you were only joking
You were only joking, brother

[Verse 2]
We talked about our mothers, kissed the wounds of our fathers
I could have been your sister, I would have been your brother
You kissed me like I was a soldier headed for war
I'm a dying man but I don't know what for

[Chorus]
And you were only joking
You were only joking, brother
You were only joking (Wide-eyed and laughing)
You were only joking, brother (Dancing up to the bright side)

[Verse 3]
Gravel and glass on the bottom of my feet
I bruised my heels on the swollen street
We were girls in bars, boys on the town
Bumping like a pinball off a careless crowd
You might also like[Verse 4]
You said good friends are hard to come by
I laughed and bought you a beer, it's too corny to cry
Well, sentiment given or sentiment lost
You shake it off with a smirk and a toss

[Chorus]
And you were only joking
You were only joking, brother
You were only joking
You were only joking, brother
And you were only joking
(Gravel and glass on the bottom of my feet)
You were only joking, brother
(I bruised my heels on the swollen street)
You kissed me like a soldier headed for war
(Joking, you were only joking)
I'm a dying man
And you were only joking
(Don't know what for, dying man)
You were only joking brother
(Don't know what for)
And you were only
And you were only
And you were only joking
Brother
[Outro]
One two three four
Ah yeah
Sha la, sha la
Sha la, sha la
Sha la, sha la (Wide eyed and laughing)
Sha la, sha la (Dancing up to the bright side)
Sha la, sha la (Wide eyed and laughing)
Sha la, sha la (Dancing up to the bright side)
Sha la, ooh hoo (Wide eyed and laughing)
