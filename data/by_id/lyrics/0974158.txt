It's plan and simple as it can bring things
Take prespective before it comes your way
I'm am so thankful to God for this day
Cause for a long time the streets were my home
Slanging hard banging hard got me known
But the reason to live Ive been shown
I gotta be around to see my baby boy grow

Chorus:
Street life no more I'm throwing in the towel
Street life no more I gotta son now
Street life no more I gotta make it out
Street life no more (oh yeah yeah)
Street life no more I'm throwing in the towel
Street life no more I gotta show little man
What my life is really about

One more dealing and I'm outta this thing
Need the paper so that I can maintain
I'ma fine a job hopefully something that pays
It's hard to walk away from this figure I made
Gab the money this don't look right no more
That nigga right there I think I seen him before
Good thing he didn't make a sell or buy
He gave me four years I'll be out by the he's five

Baby don't cry I'll be home soon
I let a gang of money in the safe for you
Come write I'll make it right through
I just got his picture of his first day in preschool
He's gonna be smart just like his mom
I commend you black queen for holding on
How many days I think I'ma cry
When I get out nomore street life Oh yeah

Repeat chorus
Until fade
