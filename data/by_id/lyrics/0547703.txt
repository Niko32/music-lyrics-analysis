I remember and reminisce upon random rambling
I was hooked off just one dosage of your samplings
Ive penetrated the peripherals of impossible
Ive carl lewised every obstacle
Being friends with you girl is no longer optional
Preaching consistency consistency
But it gets tough to focus when my mind wanders and wonders
If my latest lady friend is truly into me
More then a friend but you know entimently
And essentially what comes goes and eventually
That bud blooms into a read rose
Lets change the world together
Unless your opposed
And you say all that stupid shit jus to keep me on my toes
Well i guess thats just how lifes goes
????????????????????????
????????????????????????
Until the day that i propose
Ya...
