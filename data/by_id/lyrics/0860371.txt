Everything that's yours will get to you
Just because some others get theirs early
Don't you worry, yours is coming too

You got to keep on doing what you know is right

If one goes left than the other goes right

That's right
That's right

You'll look up someday and it will be there
Everything you hoped that it would be
You love it more 'cause you have worked and waited
When it's yours you let the whole world see

You got to keep on doing what you know is right

If one goes left than the other goes right

That's right (Oho, ooohooo)
That's right, that's right, that's right

It will come in time, you just be patient
Everything that's yours will get to you
Just because some others get theirs early
Don't you worry, yours is coming too
