It seems like every time we're here
I look right back at you as your eyes perk up
And you say, "boy don't you come unglued"
I'll be some kind of busted up on the floor
I'll make a change so that you want me more
So that you want me more

[Chorus]
Is this really my idea?
I had no clue that all of this was really happening
My thoughts leave me lying on the floor
It's not my fault
I'm such an awful mess and more

[Verse 2]
Now we're here are breakneck speeds
Just to make me feel less aware of all the times
The times I've made you
Act stronger than you really wanted to
And make a face that says you know
Just what to do, you know just what to do

[Chorus]
Is this really my idea?
I had no clue that all of this was really happening
My thoughts leave me lying on the floor
It's not my fault
I'm such an awful mess and more
You might also like[Bridge]
It's true I've failed
But your love covers me
It's true I've failed

[Chorus]
Is this really my idea?
I had no clue that all of this was really happening
My thoughts leave me lying on the floor
It's not my fault
I'm such an awful mess and more
Is this really my idea?
I had no clue that all of this was really happening
My thoughts leave me lying on the floor
It's not my fault
I'm such an awful mess and more
