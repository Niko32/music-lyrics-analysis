And the journey continues

[Verse One: Sunspot Jonz]
It goes underwater verbs you swerve to the rhythm reverb
Now we mixing like a potion fizzing, fixing to blow
Here we go
You're wacker than the fools I dissed a year ago
[?] afraid to be original
Or crispy for all the chicken MC's
Industry can't pimp me
Your A&R is a hippy
Say he, knows B.E.R.O., how could it be, he works for the company
No, he don't know nothing about marketing black music
You got a job plus a deal, 'bout to lose it
And fuck you very much
Next, did I ever smoke on the job? Yes
She's the apple of my eye, give her hips a ride
I can't believe I found a friend under darkened skies
And welcome to the jungle like Axel tonight
Bought the whole damn bar and we faded and I'd like
Another fat burner for my people's who's gone
And then you move the steady motion to the groove of the song
And I'm gone and I'm gone {x3}

[Hook] {x2}
It feels good like a dream
Don't you love it baby
Now sing for me
Yeah sing for me
La la la

I'm on some Regular Joe shit, but no broke shit
I'm Joe Schmo shit
59-50 Pro fit
Trying to profit while blowing out them coffin nails
Kinda off my rocker but coppin' mail
Little bit anti-sociable but a fucks not given
Moka O, Sunspot, what's got in 'em?
Your Benz seen the proof from your grips through towns
Roof down, swoop down, I'm 'bout to hit you clowns
With the replacement factor, exacto knife
I'm life like, just back up, is that your wife?
I'm only buggin'
You're only thuggin'
What's the point
It's like a Minstrel joint, it gets the [?]
Outta bounds been real and get the coins
All the way from Vancouver to Des Moines
Ain't a sport like Crusto
Let's go Expo's
My expose will expose my gut those
Who trust those instincts, push your puck slow
Us in the changer what spray like Rusto
Bust through your speakers, your system must blow

[Hook]
