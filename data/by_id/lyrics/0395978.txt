So good now, a no good nigga doing so good now

[Sean speaks]
"As I smoke and think I realize
Just maybe your past is your past for a real reason
I guess everything does come in due season."

[PreHook by K-smoov]
It's a pleasure to see a no good nigga doing so good now
Shit was all bad just a week ago
How you you turn it around
When they let my nigga out?
My nigga you bought a house?
So you dont know niggas now?

[Verse 1]
I can feel the scales tipping
If you're real then you feel it
If you feel it then you with me
Then we gotta help the 85 percent
I was born in 87' been ready since 86'
Feel like i got my mind together it's been crazy ever since
I went through hell just to find God
Now I am one
That's a reference to Psalms 82 and 6
Had to fail to Excel
See that the point of Power
My nigga that's my Word
Everything is ours
It's not about where we come from
More the destination
Detours and reroutes screwed up the navigation
I work hard
So hard,I need a vacation
My nigga Sheed got a house in Jamaica
I owned my first house when I was 19
I'm on my third car, shit is looking like a dream
Never mind the circumstances cause it's all in how you think
I'm a...a no good nigga doing so good now

Verse 2(Smoov)
Lights Camera Action
All the shit we dream'd about
Seen and done thing i don't think that I should speak about
Life in the fast lane until I find a different route
Man, I can't wait til the day that they let my niggas out
"fuck it" type of attitude
Just do what i gotta do
Wish I knew what I know now when I was back in school
Apply it to my hustle
Get money, bag a bitch or two
Fuck her good, and when she out I'd make her by mu kid some shoes
Everyday i wake up thoughts of getting paid
Thousand dollar schemes, I'll take the chance any day
Act an ass when I pass they gon' hate it any way
They do alot of talking
But never have shit to say
Don't give a fuck if you like me
If I did it'll be a lie
I hardly need to speak you see the realness in my eyes
Money gives you power, and respect keeps you alive
So if I had to choose I'd be rich when I die
[Hook by Smoov & Sean]

Verse 3
(Sean)
Cause they let Madd out
But had to turn fish in
Finally got my chef back, he back up in the kitchen
My cousin stole my company
I pray to God be with him
I won't seek revenge, and that's the extent of my bitching

(Smoov)
And I'm missing all my niggas
This shit ain't been the same
Especially without my family that had to pass away
If you ain't been through what I go through
You will never know my pain
So all I can do is hope and pray for better days

(Sean)
What you know bout' putting hot dogs in noodles
The pitbulls that look just like poodle
We both malnourished as fuck
I guess that's hustlers luck
I'm a high priority minority
Problem with authority
Only fucked once and she acting like she go with me...GOOD!
(Smoov)
I don't really know what she think
Don't really care how she feel
See I'm a know good nigga, I'm just keeping it real
Ain't worried about making love cause I'd rather make deposits
I would never put no pussy over profit

(Sean voice sampled in the backgroud raps)
So good now, a no good nigga doing so good now

(Sean)
Cause we good
And she good
And we good
But why you so good to me
