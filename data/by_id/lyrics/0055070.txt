My hands are searching for you
My arms are outstretched towards you
I feel you on my fingertips
My tongue dances behind my lips, for you
This fire runs in through my being
Burning, I'm not used to seeing you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm alive
I'm alive

[Chorus]
I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

[Verse 2]
My hands float up above me
And you whisper you love me
And I begin to fade
Into our secret place
The music makes me sway
The angels singing, say "We are alone with you"
I am alone and they are too with you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm alive
I'm alive

[Chorus]
I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding onto what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing

[Bridge]
And so I cry (Holy)
The light is white (Holy)
And I see you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm alive (I'm alive)
I'm alive (I'm alive)
I'm alive

[Chorus]
I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healing
[Bridge]
Take my hand, I give it to you
Now you own me, all I am
You said you would never leave me
I believe you, I believe

[Chorus]
I can feel you all around me
Thickening the air I'm breathing
Holding on to what I'm feeling
Savoring this heart that's healed
