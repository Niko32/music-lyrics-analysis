There must be a reason, there just has to be
'Cause my faith is strong till it all hits home
And it's not enough for me to trust when it hurts too much

On the days I feel like I've failed You
The days I feel I've been failed
I need to praise You
For I am Yours, I'm Yours

Where is the power to give what I gave?
Give back the strength, give back the faith I had yesterday
'Cause You are my God, You are my Great I Am
And I know I have fallen but I have landed in healing hands

On the days I feel like I've failed You
The days I feel I've been failed
I need to praise You
For I am Yours, I'm Yours
And in my frailty
You lead me to something more

So I close my eyes
'Cause inside my heart I believe
That I'm not alone
You'll always be there for me
You might also likeOn the days I feel like I've failed You
The days I feel I've been failed
I know that I need to praise You
For I am Yours, still Yours
'Cause I believe you lead me to something more
Something more, something more
