You can read by the moonlight aloud and alone
And from over your shoulder it's courting your soul
Does it tell you your fortune or say nothing at all

In your dreams your montana skies
In your dreams your a ruby and sapphire prize
In your eyes something to see
In your eyes pastures of green

In the company quarter the company store
Stays making the bargain that it made before
All the people are gathered ring a roundabout
Keep their parts in their pockets bring that company down

In history wayfaring armies
Cavalries above and beyond
Some were made of mothers own babies
Some were made of mothers own young

In a small dark alley where the sun won't go
There's got to be something maybe diamonds and pearls
All the people are gathered ring a roundabout
Keep their parts in their pockets find that dark alley out

Oh mystery gem of the moment
Chivalry got lost in your smile
Some may say there's nothing to comment
Some may stay silent awhileYou might also like
