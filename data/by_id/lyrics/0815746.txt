He knows how to love me and keep me satisfied
Everytime that empty feeling starts creeping in
He picks it up and turns it into love again
Ooh he turns it into love again and he makes me feel like a woman
Ooh he turns it into love again and I'm so glad I'm his woman

He's my one in a million what would I do without him
His arms are a castle where I can run and hide
If a heartache ever shows up tryin' to get in he picks it up and turns it into love again
Ooh he turns it into love again...
Ooh he turns it into love again...
I'm so glad I'm his womanYou might also like
