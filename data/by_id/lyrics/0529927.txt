I know what you all expect me to do, a bunch of Orriginal flips
But why fuck with that when i can kill him with original flips
Like hit em off with the ratchet, that's an original bitch
Kick him down the hill, as he lays in a bag, that's original chips
Shit, but I heard name flips is the shit for the amateur dudes
So I ride your bitch and I park her, she's a Canada Goose
Try something funny when the camera shoots, and you'll get a million hands parking in
Give him so many black eyes,  you'd think it's a million man march  again
Now I've seen your battles, I have never heard a nice round
Talking about "Z your last battle was crazy"... pipe down
Unwrap him like a present, that's right now
I'm dope as fuck, no wonder my skin color is light brown
You can't carry my weight, that'll fuck your spine up
Make your chest crack, push your wig back, fuck your mind up
I throw my hand up, the talking stops like Fattah saying times up
Boy, these bars going over your head like a mugshot lineup
Let me get it lined up
I got punch lines, performance, delivery, aggression
I could punch lines or perform them and deliver the aggression
Make the correction, rob you for everything you bring on us
I'm alone, even if he stock 10, he won't ring on us
We got the thing on us, my goons cut throat
The mac make him sync like an iTunes upload
What the fuck are you up for? You better not dry snitch
Cause all you're getting after that is texts on a late night like a side bitch
Go ahead, ride the bench, while I roll up and roast him in his face
Chella gang, let my dogs maul him and put Oakville in its place
You're not fishing for shit, cause your lines are kind of sloppy
Catch a hook in the future, he won't wake up in a new Bugatti
I hope you're loyal to your fam, so I could have you laid up by your posse
Hit by 11, 11's, we'll remember them by wearing a poppy

I was watching your battle, you were rapping and shit
Twisting your hands up, clapping and shit
I was like he could spit, but that's when it happened and shit
You looked at your opponent, pouted your lip and like a sassy bitch put your hands on your hips
But I'm on some different shit, I don't rap Orthodox
I'll snatch his neck so you could really see me go off the top
Last battle they slept on me, this battle the snooze is off
I could super saiyan, street fighter, hadouken dog
Don't be stupid dog, can't none of you coast with me
Since I rep where I'm from, I'll drag him through the whole city
Start at my home, Meadowvale, that's the west end
Slap him up to ridgeway, then I'm giving him the Wesson
Pick him back up, ship em off to Rouche Court
As I take his bitch on another date like I post poned
Then its off to bristol, G & B, C view
By the time we get to 5 & 10, I make em license I'm a G2
We at h wood, Queen Fred, Fieldgate, sick mode
I got a body to bury, let me know if there's room on Cliff road
Chill hoe, your a small fry, no name, dick lover
1984 is the only time you get big brother
Chill brother
Meadowvale in the building, thats a bad batch
We post him up with the pounds, code name, hash tag
Ya'll still tryna catch bars from my last match?
Question me, I'll light your roof up, like its cash cab
But brace yourself, I'm about to drop more knowledge
I'll tear the house up, bring the canvas in like I'm door knocking
Me against a white boy, I'll teach him about the color ways like the Foamposites
While you were getting bullied at school, I was back home with the Taliban tryna throw rockets
[ROUND 3] Z HUNNA
I spit that potent shit, I got a license to shred
Why freestyle, when my style could put a price on your head
Make you light in the head, I hit throats, you chase her
Oh, that's your girl? I don drape her with cig smoke and blazers
You hit low, I majors
I dare one of you rappers to test my one, two
I hear you speak then I move your jaw, this movie's Kung Fu
I know, I know, that last bar might have been a bit of a slight reach
But these punches connecting like Rogers, that's high speed
Let me get you up to my speed
You can't go punch for punch with me, I suggest you better not try it
Out perform me? You must be on a bath salt diet
Maybe you can do personals, shit, but that's how you end up dying
Your best bet would be jokes cause... Well, you look like a clown anyway
So stop your nonsense, tell me, who you ever fought dude?
Bring your boys, I'll make them all rise like the judge in the court room
We roll 40 deep, that 40 speaks and makes 40 leap
Shoot buckets in a spur, tear drop, Tony P
Against Freestyler, you tried a wrestling scheme
That was cute but let me show you how it's really done
I show up with outlaws to shoot your road dogs with that billy gun
I ran game on your diva, every time I stopped and seen her
She called me a hardy boy cause she got on top and rocked the leader
You better be learning, boy, you watching how I'm styling on you
Hope your mom got the boarder tax cause her son just died in California
Got damn, I'm locked in
Rewind it 4 times to catch Barz I dropped in
I opt in to pop 10 in the ride you popped in
The cocked end is cocked in, pull out, drop 10
My content is top 10, as a matter of fact, top 1, the rest cannot win
Now Orriginal, you're a nice individual and I really do respect you
So I apologize for this ass whooping, I just had to show these other cats I'm nothing step to
