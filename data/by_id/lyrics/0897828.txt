I wouldnt do it Id be better off dead
Said a beautiful girl to a crowd of her friends
She didnt even think about how the loss would hurt them
Its a sad world when a mans so sick in the head
He thinks a womans life is worth less than the hole between her legs
But its even sicker if you agree
My pussy is priceless so go ahead and shoot me
Do you wanna go home in a body bag?
Youll miss Thanksgiving, hell still f*ck you when youre dead
Tell me what youre worth, what are you doing with your life
That you would give it all away for the honor of your thighs
I was stiff as death, it was a dirty bed
I wondered if my mother would sense when I was dead
His fingers traced my thighs I counted ceiling tiles
And I cried 
Just one flick of his wrist
My life would dissipate
Think about this
I did not fight. I touched his cheek
I have to live with that, Hey, at least I live
I dont wanna go home in a body bag
Id miss Thanksgiving, hed have f*cked me when Is dead
I know what Im worth, what Im doing with my life
I wouldnt give it all away for the honor of my thighs

Do you wanna go home in a body bag?
Grandma is crying and hell rape you when youre dead
Tell me what youre worth, what are you doing with your life
That you would give it all away for the honor of your thighsYou might also like
