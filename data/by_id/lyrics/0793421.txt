I can hardly bare the sight of lipstick
On the cigarettes there in the ashtray
Lying cold the way you left them
At least your lips caressed them while you packed
And a lip print on a half-filled cup of coffee
That you poured and didn't drink
But at least you thought you wanted it
That's so much more than I can say for me

[Chorus: George Jones & Alan Jackson]
But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowing
It's funny, I don't even care
And when you turned and walked away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses

[Verse 2: Alan Jackson & George Jones]
After three full years of marriage
It's the first time that you haven't made the bed
I guess the reason we're not talking
There's so little left to say, we haven't said
While a million thoughts go running through my mind
I find I haven't spoke a word
And from the bedroom those familiar sounds
Of our one baby's crying goes unheard
You might also like[Chorus: Alan Jackson, George Jones & Both]
But what a good year for the roses
Many blooms still linger there
The lawn could stand another mowing
Funny, I don't even care
And when you turned to walk away
And as the door behind you closes
The only thing I know to say
It's been a good year for the roses
