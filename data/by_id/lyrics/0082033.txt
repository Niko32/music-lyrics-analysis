And you know I'mma get it done in spite of her
And yes I know I slur, right now I see a blur
And I'm surrounded by green like the douglas fir
Wait I mean willow trees, and now I start to wheeze
But my heart is slowing down and now I'm at ease
No freeze comes off my knees, I start to cough not sneeze
Feel the light breeze and warm degrees, and no unease
I don't shoot guns no holes like swiss cheese
And I stay away from sluts don't catch no STD's
I'mma stay running despite pain from joint disease
And I'mma be the champ like one of Wu-Tang's bees
Yeah my 16 strong, and it might be hypocritical
But I'mma enjoy my life in a way that's not political
Add two e's correct, RG is analytical
Throw some green and this beat and now you got me feeling mystical
Logistical, statistical stay related like me and lyrical
In that last line I came off egotistical
I don't wanna fit in, you're hypercritical...You might also like
