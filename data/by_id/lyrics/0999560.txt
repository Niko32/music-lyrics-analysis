To talk about what's wrong
I don't care anymore
You waived that right, so long
It's so annoying when you whine
You're always wasting my time
I used to care and want you back
But now I think you're going off track
And if you said you're never comin' back
I'd be so happy, I'd be so happy
I'd laugh the whole night long

I'm better off without you
We both know that it's true
I'm better off without you
Stop calling me, you gotta stop callin'
Stop calling me, you gotta stop

Talking to all my friends
They told me when we split
They didn't ever like you
Now they lost all sympathy
It's so embarrassing when you cry
You were always spreading these lies
I used to miss you all the time
But now I think you're not so fine
And if you said you'd never waste my time
I'd be so happy, I'd be so happy
I'd laugh the whole night long
You might also likeI'm better off without you
We both know that it's true
I'm better off without you
There is no me, There is no me
There is no me, there is no me and you

He doesn't want you, can't you see?
He doesn't love you, why won't you listen to me?
He doesn't want you, can't you see?
He doesn't want you, why won't you listen to me?

I'm better off without you
We both know that it's true
I'm better off without you
Stop calling me, you gotta stop callin'
Stop calling me, you gotta stop callin'
Stop calling me, you gotta stop!
