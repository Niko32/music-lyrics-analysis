I am the iceberg, the iceberg
I've never been so scared like this before
Scared as the crowd should be
Scared now, scared on my feet
And I am times when whenever I say
Let it be times when
I never mention
I never called your name tonight
Or your name at all
Can we guess what time this is?
This is the time, to throw it all
The world won't ever change, we feel it everyday
Cause' the world won't change for us
And I am times when whenever I say
Let it be times when
I never mention
I never called your name tonight
Or your name at all
Can we guess what time this is?
This is the time, to throw it all
Colour in the pulse, it feels so empty now. (probably wrong)
So empty now
Oh, I'll dream on
And I'll dream on
I am the speechless
I am feeling restless
I am the speechless
And I'm feeling restlessYou might also like
