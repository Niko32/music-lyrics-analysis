Our defiance don't define us
Anger bubbling like deep fryers
Cold world burn off my fires
Can't tell me we ain't giants
Packs in the tank
I-95'ers
Not enough chances/ too many priors
Us veres them/ we've been divided
Revenge is sweet but smells like riot
Rebellious/ can't help it
I'm the shit that can't be held in
Baby ass about to be my new sin
She an angel/ but my dicks Hell bent
Guns on the table/ bullets of the Swisher
Smoke N the air/ but can't pull the trigger
Talking revolution sounds like whispers
Now little white girls want to be bitch Neggers

[HOOK]
This world is falling down around us
And you want me to give a What?!
Thats Why I'm Anti, Thats Why I'm Anti
All these speaches don't mean nothing
When these cops just shot my cousin (over nothing)
Thats Why I'm Anti, Thats Why I'm Anti
Extorting all these punk promoters
Bring my cut up off the doors (hoes!)
Thats Why I'm Anti, Thats Why I'm Anti
Walk around like we sick of it
We don't give a fuck in public (We Love it!)
Thats Why I'm Anti, Thats Why I'm Anti

Time pass through the glass/ without the sand
Message killed the messenger/ murdergram
Sucker for love/ chemical romance
Buried alive in Zombieland
Welfare offices over-crowded
Task Force officers 'Bout it 'Bout it
Foreign oil got the whole US drowning
And No one land should have all that power
I am the darkest hour
If u ain't peeling my doe?
Huh!

Mob through your city/ I'm a threat to most
I won't fail/ but they expect me to fold
Gotta a bad bitch/ but I need a good ho
Made a good lick/ but I need 10 more
The world is a bid/ I'm violating parole
They full of shit/ While I'm full of smoke
Need a scope just to find
Where to drop that rope
Finally figured/ I'm the nigga in P.E.'s logo
...That's why

Haters trace me/ what I portray
D.A. can't wait for my court date
She about talking/ He about walking
We been off that/ now we about brawling
They killing us and fucking us with broom sticks
And my goons ain't built like bitches
From where thugs tattoo tears
And pigs make bodies disappear
[BIRD]
Oh
These taxes Killing me, killing me
I lost so much, I feel alone (I feel alone)
I don't know (I don't know)

Oh
These haters grilling me, grilling me
This hate is filling me up whole (filling me up whole)
About to blow (About to blow)
About to low bitch!

[HOOK]

[BIRD]
Oh no
Can't give you my life away, no
Can't give you my life
Oh no, no, no

Theres a war going on outside
