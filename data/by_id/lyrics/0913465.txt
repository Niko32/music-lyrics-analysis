Its All Over Now
Slave, Bonfire
Somewhere burns a bonfire
Sending sparks on higher
Into a starless night
Filled with bats gone aflight
Such fear is on the rise
You can see it in the eyes
Of a million teenage boys
Who seek only to destroy
Inside our darkened rooms
We prepare our tombs
Bathed in the silver glow
Of all that we know
We've filled our hearts and minds
With things we will never find
So now we aspire
To set our world on fire
What does our future hold
But a grave so cold
And a place in hell
Locked inside a firey cell
We've come so many miles
But we're still at the witch trials
Ransomed to the bloody past
Betrayed we'll die at last
Slowly now the light of day
Before my eyes die away
With it fades my earthly past
Like the light it dies so fast
In my gown of spotless white
I'll take my place amidst the night
And guide each soul that comes my way
To the bonfire where I now lay
