All I wanna do (all I wanna do)
This feels so right I'm
Lovin' you
All I wanna do now
'Cause I like the way I'm
Lovin' you (you)

I used to run
I used to hide from love
But now, I'm satisfied
'Cause you showed me
That love could be
So good, so real and oh so right
So many things I used to let get in my way
Now I open up my arms and say hey

Lovin' you
It's all I wanna do
For the rest of my life
This feels so right I'm
Lovin' you
It's all I wanna do
For the rest of my days
'Cause I like the way I'm
Lovin' you (lovin' you)
You might also like(Lovin' you)
An open book, an open door
That's what you are and I thank you for
The heart you give that's sensitive
You're all I need and you're so much more
I used to fill each hour of each single day
Now I slow it down enough to say hey hey

Lovin' you
It's all I wanna do
For the rest of my life
This feels so right
I'm lovin' You
It's all I wanna do
For the rest of my days
'Cause I like the way I'm
Lovin' you (I'm lovin you, don't you know I'm)
Lovin' you
(I like the way, I like the way hey)

Ev-Ev'ry day, every day
Ev-Ev'ry night, holding me close
Never had a lover make me feel so right
Never have another, never let you go

Lovin' you
All I wanna do
This feels so right
I'm lovin' you (I'm lovin' you)
All I wanna do (all I wanna do)
The rest of my days
'Cause I like the way I'm
Lovin' you
It's all I wanna do
For the rest of my life
This feels so right I'm
Lovin' you
All I wanna do
For the rest of my life
'Cause I like the way I'm
Lovin' you
You showed me what love could be, yeah
All I wanna do
This feels so right
I'm lovin you
All I wanna do
'Cause I like the way I'm
Lovin' you
All I wanna do
