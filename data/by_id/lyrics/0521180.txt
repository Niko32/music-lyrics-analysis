How it feels to be
No longer sitting in the corner of a crowded room
To see the walls and break on through
I can feel the rhythm when I close my eyes
Moving next to me
I know that somewhere in the night there's a light from someone
Reaching out to come rescue me

[Chorus]
Wishful thinking
Waiting for the day
Someone special
Will come and wake me up again
Blissful dreaming
Thinking of the day
Someone special
Will come and wake me up again

All I ever wanted was a chance to be
A moment in a day
That someone's wishes were forever, that would never end
It helps to get me through
All I ever wanted was to close my eyes
With someone next to me
I know that somewhere in the dark there's a heart that's calling
Reaching out to come rescue me
You might also like[Chorus]

I can feel the rhythm when I close my eyes
How it feels to be
I can feel the rhythm when I close my eyes
Moving next to me
I can feel the rhythm when I close my eyes
How it feels to be
I can feel the rhythm when I close my eyes
Moving next to me

[Chorus]

All I ever wanted
When I close my eyes

All I ever wanted
When I close my eyes

All I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
When I close my eyes
