I know I've been there
I understand a helping hand means so much more
So don't despair 'cause, I'll be there you never walk alone

Here I am, just for you
Here I am and there's nothing that I wouldn't do
If there's anything in heart desires anything at all
Take my heart 'cause here I am

Tell me how can I proof my honesty
And show you how much I care?
So tenderly follow me and take my hand
And I'll be there and this I swear, you never walk alone

Here I am, just for you
Here I am and there's nothing that I wouldn't do
If there's anything in heart desires anything at all
Take my heart, 'cause here I am

If only I can find a word to show I how to feel
'Cause only I can help you see the truth
Hey oh, and should you never doubt yourself
This what I have to say be there for me and I'll do what I can

Here I am, If there's anything in heart desires anything at all
Take my heart, take my heart
If there's anything in heart desires anything at all
Take my heart, take my heart
