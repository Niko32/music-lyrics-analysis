You're a canary, I'm a coal mine
'Cause sorrow is just all the rage
Take one for the team
You all know what I mean

[Verse 2]
And I'm so sorry but not really
Tell the boys where to find my body
New York eyes, Chicago thighs
Pushed up the window to kiss you off

[Chorus]
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you

[Verse 3]
Do you remember the way I held your hand
Under the lamp post and ran
Home this way, so many times
I could close my eyes?

[Chorus]
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you

[Chorus]
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you

[Outro]
The truth
The truth
