That voice inside you that never goes away
The haunting feeling that I have to play
A game of fear soiled in this pain
These words in my mouth, this blood on my tongue
This is what its like, to come undone
We are nothing, we are nothing

Crushed by the curse, bleeding in rain
Destroyed by a look, torn by the pain
The illusion of love, crying again
But that's how it hurts when it's in your veins

The thing inside you on your blackest day
That voice inside you that makes you say
I've given up hope and I'm lost again
It eats at my heart to the bitter bitter end
Oh no, we are nothing, we are nothing
Crushed by the curse, bleeding in rain
Destroyed by a look, torn by the pain
The illusion of love, crying again
But that's how it hurts, when you go insane

Crushed by the curse, torn by the pain
Destroyed by a look, crying againYou might also like
