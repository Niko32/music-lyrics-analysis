It was an hour ago you left for better skies

I wait
I try
I stop and I cry
Will you feel safe tonight?

Bashful eyes are beautiful
They spark and shine the whole year through
Bashful eyes are beautiful
Day breaks so silently
It's sunny on the frost
Melts into a thousand shards that sparkle

I wait
I try
I stop and I cry
Will I fall asleep tonight?
