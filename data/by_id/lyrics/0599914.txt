This is how the story went
I met someone by accident
Who blew me away and blew me away
It was in the darkest of my days
When you took my sorrow and you took my pain
And buried them away, buried them away

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away

[Verse 2]
You dropped me off at the train station
Put a kiss on top of my head
Watched me wave, you watched me wave
Then you went on home to your skyscrapers
And neon lights and waiting papers
That you call home, you call it home

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
You might also like[Verse 3]
I woke up feeling heavy hearted
I'm going back to where I started
The morning rain, the morning rain
And although I wish that you were near
The same old road that brought me here
It's calling me home, it's calling me home

[Chorus]
I wish I could lay down beside you when the day is done
And wake up to your face against the morning sun
But like everything I've ever known you'll disappear one day
So I'll spend my whole life hiding my heart away
I can spend my whole life hiding my heart away
