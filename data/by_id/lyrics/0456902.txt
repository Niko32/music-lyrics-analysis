I'm not a groupie I'm a odd ball
Don't have to grab on my nuts just to get attention
My attentions is just to be the greatest don't have to fake it just to make it
I've been real since day one
So my fans respect me like we family
If I can't change the world imma change my city
My city got my back like Canon and Kel
I will never turn my back on the 319. Fuck what you said I'm a dark nigga with dreads
Fuck all of you rappers
Fuck all of you hoes
You never hold my back when i was crossing the street
Tryna make that dollar
Don't you got that bands?
You talk it like you got it
Why you asking me shit....
I don't know shit.....
I been running the streets since i was yea young
Never had a car
So i truck it on my own two feet
So i got every where i wanted to be
If it means stealing candy from a baby
I'm not trying be the greatest I'm just asking for spot
If i have shoot i will, Just to get that spot
I'm hungry and I want it so you better move down a notch
Fuck around and get dismiss by your own GM
You then fuck around and got sign to a labeled
