I never set out to be anything specifically
Just wanted to live but this, this found me
And at first I didn't even care if I died young
Because as long as the ones I love are protected
This is protection
What deserves to be acknowledged must be acknowledged
That's a given

[Hook]
Ohhh, ah ah ah (x4)

[Verse 2: Meek Demeo]
The fact, whether or not I love her probably won't change
However the fact, I changed the way I felt about love
It's nothing but a lapse of feelings, a mental disorder
Especially now that I realized
That those little words are just full of feelings
The memories I won't sell
But to do a great work, one has to make sacrifices
That is equivalent exchange
You were my sacrifice
That is the most beautiful mistake I ever made
You are

[Hook](x4)
