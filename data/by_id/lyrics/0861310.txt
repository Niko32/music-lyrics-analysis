I'm just waiting for a sign
Only God know what I'm feeling
See me looking for that sign
But the devil he may get me
Somewhere between Highway 61 and 49

Well now Mama used to cry
Lord help that boy of mine
My Mama used to cry
She said lord help that son of mine
Cos there's only one place that he's wanting
Somewhere between Highway 61 and 49

Oh there was only ever one place
For the troubled soul to find
Oh there was only ever one place
For the troubled soul to find
Caught between the bible and the devil
Somewhere between Highway 61 and 49

Roll a dice, take a chance
Put your future on the line
Roll a dice and take a chance
Put your future on the line
Cos your fear and your fortune
Is somewhere between Highway 61 and 49

There's only one place for this kind
