Hey baby, you don't have to live this way
You don't have a debt to pay
So put your foot down and pick your heart up off the ground
'Cause that's not where you belong
I can prove that without this song
But for now, just play along

[Chorus]
I know you been hurt by the way he talks to you
Hurt by the way he fights with you no, no hurt by the way that he loves you
I know you been hurt by the way that he talks to you
Hurt by the way that he fights with you no no hurt by the way that he loves you
Yeah, Yeah

[Verse 2]
9-1-1, I think we lost another one
Said he had a gun and called it love
Pulled the trigger to her head
And now she's dead, livin' for another one
But you're worth more than you think and
I know you're strong enough not to sink
Your chin up, girl, I believe in you

[Chorus]
I know you've been hurt by the way that he talks to you
Hurt by the way that he fights with you, no no
Hurt by the way that he loves you
I know you've been hurt by the way that he talks to you
Hurt by the way that he fights with you, no no
Hurt by the way that he loves you

Yeah, yeah
Now, I know a lot of girls in this life
Will end up with the wrong guy tonight
But I really wanna prove a point to this young boy
Right here, let's fight
He got his fists ready, I got my pen ready
But I'll write somethin' so heavy
It 'll bust up his brand new Chevy
Man, man, poor excuse of a man
Talk-a-these girls with sweet talk
And then beat them like trash talk
Girls, please, listen to me, please
I know you, I know you, I know you

[Chorus]
I know you've been hurt by the way that he talks to you
Hurt by the way that he fights with you, ooh, woah, yeah
I know you've been hurt by the way that he talks to you
Hurt by the way that he fights with you, no no
Hurt by the way that he loves you
By the way that he loves you
