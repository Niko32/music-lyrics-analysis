What she needs or how to let go
It feels like being married
She was too young to miscarry

She says, "Bye, bye my childhood dream man
I will keep in touch if I can
Spent the best years of my life with you."

Happens every time
You start to lose yourself
You turn to blame
The one who loves you the most
To stay and work it out
Is harder than to run away
So she leaves a note
Because to his face she couldn't say
"Bye, bye my childhood dream man
I will keep in touch if I can
Spent the best years of my life with you."

Hold on if you can
Hold on

So all things
Fade away in time
What was once so bright
Somehow no longer shines
Caught the pain at last
Thought he was the one
Thought she had the strength
To hold on
You might also like"Bye, bye my teenage angel
I don't know how the spell was broken
I don't know what I'm doing
But I'll miss you."
