The dream is fading, now I'm staring at the door
I know it's over 'cause my feet have hit the cold floor
Check my reflection, I ain't feelin' what I see
It's no mystery (Mystery, mystery)

Whatever happened to a passion I could live for?
What became of the flame that made me feel more?
And when did I forget

[Chorus]
That I was made to love You
I was made to find You
I was made just for You
Made to adore You
I was made to love
And be loved by You (Loved by You)

[Verse 2]
The dream's alive with my eyes opened wide
Back in the ring, You've got me swinging for the grand prize
I feel the haters spittin' vapors on my dreams
But I still believe

I'm reachin' out, reachin' up, reachin' over
I feel a breeze cover me called Jehovah
And, Daddy, I'm on my way
'Cause I was made to love
You might also like[Chorus]
I was made to love You
I was made to find You
I was made just for You
Made to adore You
I was made to love
And be loved by You

You were here before me
You were waiting on me
And You said You'd keep me
Never would You leave me
I was made to love (I was made to love)
And be loved by You (Loved by You)

I was made to love You
I was made just for You
I was made to love (I was made to love)
And be loved by You (Loved by You-ou-ou-ou-ou)

Anything I would give up for You (Na-na-na-na-na)
Everything, I'd give it all away (Na-na-na-na-na)
Anything I would give up for You (Na-na-na-na-na)
Everything, I'd give it all away (Na-na-na-na-na)

Anything I would give up for You (Na-na-na-na-na)
Everything, I'd give it, I'd give it all away
Oh yeah

[Outro]
'Cause I was made to love You
(I was made to love You)
Yeah, I was made to love You
(I was made to find You)

'Cause I was made to love You

I was made to love You
Yeah I'm loved by You
