Who the fuck is calling?
And I need my dough

I go crazy, I go crazy, I go crazy for the money
I go crazy, I go crazy, I go crazy (Up for the hustling)

[verse 1] Lottery Billz

Yah, I go crazy for the money
And I'm juggin, I'm finnessin.. All the lyricses I told ya
I be high as fuck in public
Shit u talking boy it's nuthin
And we pull up to the club, I'm the most important person
I can't hear you, I don't listen
I be doing what I got to
Drink Bacardi like it's water
I just want to put it on u
I will take it if I need it
Ziplock on the table
We be ridin round the city
Do you wanna ride with us?
You might also likeI'm just leaning on this actavis I keep this shit 1 hunnid
I be leaning all the weekend I ain't even getting sober
I'm just tryna run them bands up and my eyes get lower
I'm so high, I'm at the stars, I woke up I'm off this coma

I know bout your block
I been shooting them chops
Gettin the guap, like fuck all the opps
We puffin a lot
Just look at my watch
She sucking my cock
I cum on her face, electroshock
Calm your ass down baby
Just don't tell the cops
