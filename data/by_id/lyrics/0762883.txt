But I know the sun's up; I can't sleep I can't think I can't fight
Wake me up or let me sleep
But don't wait on the dreams I don't keep
I'm different from you -- it's hard but it's true
So love, let me be the me that you knew
Morning is coming one bird at a time
This house has no windows you'd think it would keep out the noise
But the walls are a trap kit, the furniture moans at the joints
Be my rock or be my sand
But don't hold out for news of my plans
I'm different from you -- it's hard but it's true
So love let me be, I'll walk us both through
Morning is coming one bird at a time
Wake me with voices of pardon and voices of peace
Walk with me over the threshold and shoulder your grief
Let's be the traffic lights, let's be the train
Let's be the mittens left out in the rain
Let's be each other and let's be together again
This house has no windows; you'd think it would keep out the light
Though a new day don't mean much to someone who has to be right
Work my nerves or work your wiles
But don't bank on a change in my style
I'm different from you -- it's hard but it's true
Still I'd rather be sadder and wiser with you
