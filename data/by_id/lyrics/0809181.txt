Some love the city and some never stray from the farm, no
I'm always drawn to the echo of some distant trail
And a long stretch of lonesome constantly callin' my name

My spirit is restless and rebellin' burns in my blood
Wide lines and black top they keep my wheels chasin' the sun
I've come to accept all the things I know I'll never change
Like a long stretch of lonesome constantly callin' my name

I swung a hammer till my hands were blistered and sore
I've loaded trucks till my back couldn't take anymore
Hey, I've been in the arms of some places I should have stayed
But a long stretch of lonesome is constantly callin' my name

My spirit is restless and rebellin' burns in my blood
Wide lines and black top they keep my wheels chasin' the sun
I've come to accept all the things I know I'll never change
Like a long stretch of lonesome constantly callin' my name, ohh
Let's go, yeah

At the end of the highway they'll chisel my name in the stone
They'll bury my body but they'll never bury my soul, no

My spirit is restless and rebellin' burns in my blood
Wide lines and black top they keep my wheels chasin' the sun
I've come to accept all the things I know I'll never change
Like a long stretch of lonesome constantly callin' my name
