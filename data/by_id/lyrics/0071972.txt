[VERSE 1: MASON SPADE]
Chick said she's a brainiac-
Want a maniac
Lick me like a missle pop
Said she like the body shop
Favorite line is hot kiss
Said she wanna hot kiss
Say I'm on her hot list
Says she needs a  witness
Well tell your mom she can to come too
Living in the sweet life
You know I got you
You you got aces up my sleeve
Vaping on them trees
I can get it , if you need
I'm Sactown's finest
So burban wit it
No mama
You don't need a corset to fit it
You looking mighty cakey
Can I cupcake wit it
Bake it in the oven
Don't worry I can fit it
Women never tell the truth
And they never lie
I can fuck you till you silly
But you gotta be my allibye
And when I'm bye bye gone
You better be prepared to let bygones be bygones

Play your cards right when you dealin' wit me
There ain't a price on your heart cause I could win it for free
Lingerie and jeans fit best on frankies
I wake it up, shake it up, then put it back to sleep
.. Now she tellin' me I'm beyond amazing
And when we done I have her over the stove cooking bacon
Oops baby you got my life mistaken
Yu were just here for the moment taken.. ARE YOU READY?

[HOOK: Mason Spade and Krizztyle]

On your mark, get set, Go
Are you ready?
On your mark, get set, Go
Sitting in the back ,Joint pre-rolled
Frankie on my lap, this how my life goes
