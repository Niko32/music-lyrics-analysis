{1st Verse}
Young nigga from the inner city (New Orleans)
Hustle harder than any nigga in ya city
Na they know my face in every city
From the place where the levees shitty (New Orleans)
Tell me why can't I?
Give my gift like Santa
Niggas b in hate mode
Dawg I be in Atlanta
Chillen at the Palace with French Montana
Shout out my nigga EZ I make it look easy
But it's not believe me
They had days I was stressed out
I sold everything except out
Na ah nigga circle small when I step out
They could had mo Ballers but them niggas crept out
Life's a gamble a lot of niggas crap out
I keep it movin man there ain't nothin to cry about
A lot of niggas washed up I ain't the one to dry em out
Let em suffer ole square mother fuckas

{2nd Verse}
Started in the streets but I left em
Niggas hatin on me but I feel like FM
Grind to the AM
Niggaa want mine like I pay em
Niggas want mine so no minds what I pay em
And they on even wan live why spray em
Pounds on the table let my Lil brother weigh em
We ca use da square jus depend on ha you payin
An my bitch twist my hair na I'm lookin like sayian
I got kicks on the way in
Man the young nigga ball like Peyton
I do this shit for all my niggas starein
At the wall in the state pen
Free my nigga Ernie & free my nigga Jason
I'm jus tryna stay free like a mason
It's cops down the street an I think them bitches case'n
I done got high na my fuckin mind race'n
And yea I got it all but a nigga ain't complacent
