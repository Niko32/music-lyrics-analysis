Lonely boy
All alone steady facebook stalkin'
Shawty please pick up the phone
I'm drunk alone
In my zone
Watchin' Space Jam faded
Shawty what you sippin' on?

[Verse 1: Bobby Trill]
3hunna emails
I ain't even open
20 tabs open
Facebook stalkin'
Sad emotions
Lonely boy clique, chillin'
Catch us playin' ski free
Windows 95
Netscape goon monopoly
Bitch I'm showin' out
Visions from a shaman king
Got me swervin', swervin' Kawasaki's, 40oz
LBC we toke galactic, melting galaxies
Gucci buckled down with diamond plated crowns and polo socks
Skinny nigga but my pockets fat so call me Uncle Phil
What you mean that you ain't down to cut bitch?
Don't you know I'm Bobby Trill?
Neon skies and purple rain, what a picture
Master Splinter mixed with Bobby Fischer
Bitch I'm gonna get ya wow
