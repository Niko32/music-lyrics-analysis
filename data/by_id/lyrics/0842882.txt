Brutally insane smooth like the break of a wave
She was cool like a magical groove on a January day
In one of her moves she was hot lemonade sweet sour and powerful up in your face
Now its tough to forget what she told you to say because it just unfolds on the back of your mind
All day, all day
Like silver sage is slowly burning sweetly from my shoulders to my scena with a lonely little smile
Insane but at the same time so revealing to give you all the feeling

(Chorus) Lady magic she was real good at it, the way that she got to my mind
Lady magic help me break my bad habits and put my darker days behind
She loves suggesting that life was so interesting all the time
Lady magic she was real good at it and im glad I get to call her mine
Although life used to treat me so I had so many places to go
Not so many places where I could feel at ease
But then something happened to turn a young speaker
Into someone that had no choice but to inhale a song like wind and carried on until I would find my voice
Because she was

(Chorus)
Funnel my words and I and I and I dot my tees and cross my I's
And oh lifes funny, you making that honey is bigger than a deeper meaning at all
So I tried dipping into any institution that was capable of being dissolved
Lifes tragic, see what you want you get the chance so you got to grab it all and she wasYou might also like
