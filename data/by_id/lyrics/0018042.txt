Drag-On
Uh
Look, look, look, look

[Verse 1: Drag-On]
I don't mean to sound blunt, can I hit it, ma?
I ain't the one to blame, baby, he did it, huh?
I ain't the one that gave the kitty cat kittens, ma
Shit, you know Drag quick to be admittin', huh?
Yeah, I told I did when I didn't, huh?
How many of y'all mamis y'all think could fit in my car?
Only two in the GT, no body guard
Not a wide body, keep a chick, body wide
Mami, everything I promise you, I mean that
Keep a pretty mami like Angie Martinez
Yo, my people, yo, we out, where the party at?
Bag a chick, then I'm like, "Where the car keys at?"
Pardon me, black
Left for this chick like, "Can I hold that?"
If the cat get one more dance before I get in the pants, she coming where the dough at
And that's right here
Look, look, look at shorty right there
With that blonde hair whippin' with the night airs, yeah
You know Drag hit the pipe there, yeah
All I did was ask her, she said, "Yeah"
No fair, it was too easy
It was too sleazy
Either you wet, or this rubber too greasy
That's how I like it, make you talk to it, squeeze me
Any time you wanna call, you could reach me
I'm like an apartment, you could lease me
Y'all might as well call me the policeman
The way I keep the puss' locked in my precinct
Passenger seat, I keep somethin' decent
Drop the top and let her do the breezin'
But I'm not hearin' it
I'll leave you with a question mark if you on your period

You off the chain, daddy, you awfully freaky, boy
You wanna do it from the front, daddy? Ooh, well I like it from the back, boy
You wanna do it from the side, daddy? Get on top, rough ride, boy
Said, you off the chain, daddy, you awfully freaky, boy
Come on
When you want me, come get me, I'll be easy, daddy
Spark the flame, I'm on fire, yeah, you so freaky, boy
Don't hold back, got contact, get rough and ready, daddy
I can't wait, got me anxious, Drag, come on

[Verse 2: Drag-On]
Look, look, look, look
Yo, mami wanna get with this
But Drag play it safe, I wear a red hat like Limp Bizkit
I don't even put it back, I just put it right on the tip and jump right on the hips
Everybody wanna count Drag-On chips
'Stead of chump chuggers counting the own chips
Cat, please, I might let you in my whip
But don't it come with that chick in the passenger seat, ha-ha
Mami wanna fight, we can thump, we can thump
'Til I grab my hammer like "Pumps and a Bump"
Love how you look with that donk-da-da-donk
Got the big truck, we can pop in the trunk
Mami wanna ask me why I'm so quick to slide a chick, listen, it might sound stupid
But the reason why this tall, slim, handsome can't keep his pants on 'cause the size too big, you feel me?
You don't really wanna try this kid, you feel me?
'Cause you know I got shots to give, you feel me?
Look at the ass on the honey, look, look at shorty
She know I keep the cash money like wo'-woadie
Tough guys, you know Double R give a chick a rough ride
And when she come home, look out your window, I'm pullin' off right outside, in my ride, in my ride
[Chorus: Aja]
You off the chain, daddy, you awfully freaky, boy
You wanna do it from the front, daddy? Ooh, well I like it from the back, boy
You wanna do it from the side, daddy? Get on top, rough ride, boy
Said, you off the chain, daddy, you awfully freaky, boy
Come on
When you want me, come get me, I'll be easy, daddy
Spark the flame, I'm on fire, yeah, you so freaky, boy
Don't hold back, got contact, get rough and ready, daddy
I can't wait, got me anxious, Drag, come on

[Verse 3: Drag-On & Aja]
Look, look, look, look
Look at shorty mean booty
Yeah, I keep 'em in the kitchen, so I keep 'em on skates like Tootie
And I love it when they throw it in my face and they not a groupie, but they still wanna do me
Chick could have fooled me
How the hell you professional the first time?
Oh, you ain't come yet? Oh, but I came to win
And you gon' come when I come back again
I'm back again
I took it like Schwarzenegger, I'll be back to pound your back
Now mami, tell me how you like the sound of that?
Like when I hit it like (Mmm)
Now did I hit it right? (Yeah)
When I flip her over, then I shook her like (Damn)
But that's too tight
So I flip her back over, tear a back bone, uh
Mami might need a back donor
[Chorus: Aja]
You off the chain, daddy, you awfully freaky, boy
You wanna do it from the front, daddy? Ooh, well I like it from the back, boy
You wanna do it from the side, daddy? Get on top, rough ride, boy
Said, you off the chain, daddy, you awfully freaky, boy
Come on
When you want me, come get me, I'll be easy, daddy
Spark the flame, I'm on fire, yeah, you so freaky, boy
Don't hold back, got contact, get rough and ready, daddy
I can't wait, got me anxious, Drag, come on
You off the chain, daddy, you awfully freaky, boy
You wanna do it from the front, daddy? Ooh, well I like it from the back, boy
You wanna do it from the side, daddy? Get on top, rough ride, boy
Said, you off the chain, daddy, you awfully freaky, boy
Come on
When you want me, come get me, I'll be easy, daddy
Spark the flame, I'm on fire, yeah, you so freaky, boy
Don't hold back, got contact, get rough and ready, daddy
I can't wait, got me anxious, Drag, come on
