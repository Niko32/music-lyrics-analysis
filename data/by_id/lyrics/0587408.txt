I'm breaking into Hip-Hop like a new pair of shoes
Stepping on the competition and bending, breaking rules
They don't want to see what I can do
I think they're scared 'cause I'm something new
To their ears, I have been prepared for stares
Nobody thought that I would be here
Catching dreams like winter snowflakes on my tongue
But let me show you a magic trick
I click my heels three times and I'm back at this
Back home in the dojo
That is my studio if you ain't know doe
So if you really think that you can stop this
You haters on something strong
The thing is with this music I am too far gone

[Bridge]
Are you scared of what you know about me? Or the things you don't?
What is it about me that intimidates you the most?
I'm accomplishing things that you have only dreamed
Is that why you are on your computer hating?

[Hook]
Making all these haters disappear
Making all these haters disappear
Making all these haters disappear
Making all these, all these, all these, all these
All these haters disappear
Making all these haters disappear
Making all these haters disappear
Making all these, all these, all these, all these
You might also likeI call it magic, oh boy, this scene is tragic
All you little trolls, I swear that you have all been slacking
Making all these haters disappear
Making all these haters disappear
Making all these haters disappear
Making all these, all these, all these, all these

[Verse 2: FrivolousShara]
The difference between constructive criticism and hate?
One actually helps, and the other is a disgrace

What am I to do with "You suck"?
What am I to do with "You wack"?
I know what I wanna do
Find myself in front of you
Serve a plate of your words
Eat em'

But because of hate, I'm spitting bullet bills
I'm underdog with a bone to pick
So this is how I feel
Talk all you want
I've got more fans than haters
Because of my nature, you may be back later
