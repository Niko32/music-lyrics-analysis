Ain't it's funny how We almost there?
I can smell the victory in the air
Now bandwagons wanna jump on our side
But these niggas never catch a ride
Cause they already know that I'm reppin oTo
And Don't let me in my zone,.cause the $oljaz right behind me and I never work alone
Cause if I did this on my own, this shit wouldn't last long
But dont get that shit twisted, so in case you niggas missed it
I'm a need for you to listen
Cause if I did this on my own I'll have niggas wanting to kill me
And a bitch that tried to diss me would turn fake and say she miss me
Aw naw
Cause I can't have none of that, so my $oljaz got my back
Just to keep my mind on track, and if I ever fall off track
Then I might fall under attack and them $oljaz won't look back
And I ain't having none of that
Aw yeah
I guess that's a part of getting older
I guess I'll have to fucking grow up
And it's Operation Takeover
And I'm a Yung Ice,Aw yeah
And I'm a Yung Ice,Aw yeah
And I'm a Yung Ice,Aw yeah
And I'm a Yung Ice,Aw yeah
I gotta keep interrupting myself cause

All I care is bout the money and the city that I'm from
I'm a sip until I feel it, I'm a smoke until it's done
I Don't really give a Fuck and my excuse is that I'm young
And I'm only getting older Somebody should've told ya

I'm only getting older, only only getting older(Repeat 12x)


[Verse: C-Note]
Ok I touched down in 96
Flippin haters off like a light switch
Gotta bad bitch that's enticing
If you look at her then its Tyson
Heard yo new shit but I ain't like it
I oughta  beat yo ass with a nightstick
Imma god and you just a titan
I ain't even gotta rap I'll let my mic spit
Oh man
You are listening to the best now
You don't fuck with us then we don't fuck with yall cause them $oljaz don't mess around
Oh man
Should I listen to yall or just my team
Cause my team like the Miami Heat,got a team full of All-Stars bout to get a ring
That's a deal, we gon be blowing half a mill
Yall some babies enfamil
Im just keeping this shit real
I swear yall niggas so weak
I'm the lightskin Chief Keef
Gotta team full of goons and I ain't talking GBE
Look just understand that we runnin shit like a treadmill do some cardio in this bitch
We still the shit without a video its just audio in this bitch
Asking you to please excuse my french language
I don't want you to get mistaken
You makin payments and we the bank now that's a big statement
Oh man
[Outro]
That I'm only getting older, I already told ya
That I'm bout to takeover with SMB and them Yung Ice,Hold up
Cause I ain't even done yet, you rappers is some posers
YI$ the team and We Don't need No one to coach us
Y'all already know us and We about to blow up
Making all this paper dammit, I'm a need a folder
Jealousy in the air, why you haters hate us so much
We making it to the top and the throne already chose us
We go hard in the paint why you think We always post up?
We see bigger pictures and you niggas just on posters
We can see the light,so does that means we getting closer?
And you already know that I'm a Yung Ice $olja
