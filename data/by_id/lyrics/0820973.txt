As running drops upon a dream
The moonlight is shinning in the sky of winds
The dark night falls into the sea
And rising sun lies on her sleep
Summer is coming...
Her eyes will feel the light of ancient silence
Until another day will come
Outside the door the ice dissolves the horizon
Water falls from the hidden cries
The breath of rain lies on the ground;
Dried by the voice of her prowl
Snow mountains full of empty sounds
Graze her warm hands, full of the sky
And fill the space behind her eyes
Forever...
The last breath melts away
Wounded by wind of day
Changing words rises on
The sweet sea of her lost dreamYou might also like
