Can I get a bedroom encore?
Just can't get enough girl I want more
From when you feel between the sheets tonight
Is more than I can ask for
Can I get a bedroom encore?
Just can't get enough girl I want more
From when you feel between the sheets tonight
Is more than I can ask for

Mami I just wanna ride you
And giddy giddy up, giddy giddy giddy up
And take it to the room like
Giddy giddy boom boom giddy boom giddy bye bye
And taste tu fruta de bomba
Como dice el gata

Wanna believe in you, what else can I do?
Wanna believe it's true when I hold on to you
Let's make love right under the moon
Baby it's right here in my bedroom
