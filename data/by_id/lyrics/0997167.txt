Baby, I love you so
I want you to know
That I'm gonna miss your love
The minute you walk out that door

With or without you
With or without you, oh
I can't live
With or without you
You might also likeI was just alone and mad
With my suitcase in my hand
Part of a travelling band
On the road
(Well we are knowing)
I never need it any one
And my music it's my fun
And I wake up lady like
Till regret it, oh, oh, oh

We all need love I swear it's true
All that children me and you
We all need love I swear it's true
All that children me and you

With or without out
Please don't go
With or without out
Please don't go
With or without out
Please don't go
With or without out
One, two, three, four

See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
And I wait for you
Please don't go
Please don't go
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you
With or without you
With or without you, oh
I can't live
With or without you

Please don't go
Don't go
Don't go away

You thought when you had left me
That you'd really tear me apart
But what you didn't understand?
Is that you really didn't own my heart?
You went out and did everything
Made me stay at home
But all the time while you were out there, girl
I wasn't always at home alone

Tell me who
Who's fooling who
Are you fooling me?
Or am I fooling you?
Who's fooling who
Who's fooling who
Were you fooling me?
Or was I fooling you?
Love
We all need love
We all need love
We all need love
Love
We all need love
We all need love
We all need love

The minute you walk out that door

Please don't go

I'm begging you to say

See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
And I wait for you
Please don't go
Please don't go
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you

With or without you
With or without you, oh
I can't live
With or without you

And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

You thought when you had left me
That you'd really tear me apart
But what you didn't understand?
Is that you really didn't own my heart?
You went out and did everything
Made me stay at home
