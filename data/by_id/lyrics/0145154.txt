Listen to me
There's no reason why
We shouldn't agree

If i hurt your feeling
I apologize
You're the only one
That I idealize
Don't cry baby
Don't cry baby
Dry your eyes
Let be sweetheart again

You know I didn't mean to
Make you feel blue
Honest I never do it again

Won't you forgive
Won't you forget
Do as I ask you too
I never let you regret
If you just start a new
You know I'm sorry
Oh so sorry
Just don't cry baby
There's no one but you
You might also likeWon't you forgive
Won't you forget
Do as I ask you too
I never let you regret
Just start a new
You know I'm sorry
Oh so sorry
Don't cry baby
There's no one but you

Don't cry baby
There's no one but you
