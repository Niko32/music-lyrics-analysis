I open a book and break through time
Let's pick your brain tell me what you're thinking inside
I got words, words, words like Hamlet just less absurd
So listen to me closely your vision of life is blurred
Trapped between the sea and the sky that's the great divide
Imprisoned in the day-to-day that's the daily grind
What is life? Who am I? What's over there? What's inside?
Sometimes the easy answers are the hardest to find
Mix two colours and you haven't made anything new
Write a story and you'll see how that's true
What's truer than true? What's truer than you? Stop it, I'm feeling blue!
Evolving like an organism language keeps on growing
Expanding like an ego filled of malicious lies
Is it not clear that snowflakes don't mean it's snowing
Count down your days, whatever you get paid do you not see the flies?
Question it, question the world, question your empty bookshelf
Stand in front of that for a change it's a better reflection of yourself
Take a step back to nature and contain your fear
There's no need to be scared the darkness is here
Turn on a lamp and that world is gone
With your fingers, click click, and you've created a world you've drawn
My rhymes are off the dome but they're not accidental
Perfect like Shakespeare come on don't be mental
But regardless think of all your thoughts hopes and dreams
Realize that death is the dominator of everything you seek
You pride yourself on ignorance choosing not to think instead
Not the only one at the graveyard with a NOBODY on your tomb's head
Die before you die that's all I'm gonna say
Like a cemetery after an obituary it's just a state of mind that's just habituary
Your pride is inflated like a balloon
But don't poke it, it's hollow you'll find out soon
Let me paint you a picture with my imaginative mind
Hindenburg crashed, Titanic sank both giants in time
Love, passion death and joy take your time sit back and enjoy
Don't put your visors on, close off your mind, seek within and destroy

Words, words, words is all you say
Yet they just keep on fading away
If you can hear your words then you can't be your words, word
Without literature your imagination can’t grow
What’s in your imagination you don’t even know
We need to imagine a better world that’s our destination
Which means breaking free from this system, obliteration
You think your imprisoned in this world with no other selection
That’s because your obedient, you don’t question
Now Shakespeare is holding up a mirror
Look if you dare, you might see what you fear
Hamlet is anchored by the past trying to control the future
The world is too unpredictable, you can't be sure
To be or not to be that is the question
He’s stuck in thought, it only fuels his aggression
The past and the future don’t exist
Yet you always think about it, you can’t resist
Everything you see you take as real your as mixed up as a tornado
There’s more beyond the cave, just ask Plato
It’s all just noise
Yet you take it as a real and obey Noah Noyes
All your doing is singing in your cage
You’ll be free from the silence, that’s the next stage
[Jacob Krone]
So listen to me everything I say is true
Cause if you're watching me then who's watching you?
[Verse 3-Jacob Krone]
I wanna know the meaning of life without all the bull
Might be hard to do with all the books I pull
Long nights early mornings sippin' on red bull
Should be asking is it worth it my mind still half full
4 years of school imagination far behind my mind
Comforting that I'm not the only one of my kind
Imprisoned by the thesis that is my life
Go to school, get a job it'll be alright
I wanna be the hero of my own life
Know what's unknown, help me goddess I'll fight the real fight
Come back with new knowledge show the world I've grown
Hold on I'm getting ahead of myself I'm still unknown
I can live any day just not today
Bug off tinker bell I don't care what you say
Show me a better world that's one not my own
I'll show you a comfy bed, one inside my home
But with every closed book comes a closed mind
And wherever I look there's nothing to find
I have time, I don't know what the trouble is
Or maybe that is the trouble as Buddha says
Like a voyage I'm not wanted but you couldn't tell
I'm fake as an idea believers try to sell
Alas, poor me my mirror is finally shattered
My mind is awoken and my life is battered
