And please beware, they'll kill without a care (oooh)
Clasp your hands and make some weather
Cause after all we live together
Soak up the ball, though which we're tethered
Close up this space, close up the nether
We stand worlds apart
It grows, this dark, the demons, and the sharks (oooh)
But once too tall, they'll crumble, it will fall (oooh)
Clasp your hands and make some weather
Cause after all we live together
Soak up the ball, though which we're tethered
Close up this space, close up the nether
We stand worlds apart
We stand worlds apart
I had a friend who told me that
The world was going to end
He went to school to learn the law
So he could help defend
"These wolves", he said, "are gathering
They're meeting on a farm
They'll start a revolution and they'll never take a partYou might also like
