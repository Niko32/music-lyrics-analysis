All the blue rolled into gray
Now in the dark, alone I lay
Should have stopped
But I could never ever stay

Somewhere in the night
Inside my dreams you burn so bright
And I'm with you there and everything's alright
Somewhere in the night
Before the darkness turns to light
Let me love you there, somewhere in the night

Second chances, I won't get
Wouldn't dare to hope and yet
Everywhere I turn I see your silhouette
Been so long but I never will forget

Somewhere in the night
Inside my dreams you burn so bright
And I'm with you there and everything's alright
Somewhere in the night
Before the darkness turns to light
Let me love you there, somewhere in the night

Time after time, I find that I'm thinking about you
Up on the hill I see you still but I just can't reach
Who would answer your prayers?
Who would wait by the stairs?
Not Me
Not Me

Inside my dreams you burn so bright
And I'm with you there and everything's alright
Somewhere in the night
Before the darkness turns to light
Let me see your face
Feel your warm embrace
Let me love you, somewhere in the night
