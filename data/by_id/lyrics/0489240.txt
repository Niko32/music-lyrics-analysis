[Verse 1: Bigal Harrison]
I'm a fucking Young Legend...
Shouts out to the reverend...
Bout to make a profit from them rappers bodies he blessing
There's limited love when you great..
Just tons of hate y'all all fake
I see through y'all niggas
Ain't cool with niggas
I just chill with the crew that's it...(HOL UP)
They don't understand
They don't know the life i'm living dog
So much pressure diamonds the only thing I could give you dog
Fuck that weak ass music that you promote nigga I mean that...
Competition what I'm provoking get involved you gon be matched....
Plotting on a trilly my niggas they know what time it is..
Kingin like Lebron and the youngest man but don't ride the bench
Creating that greatness I'm Tupac mixed with that Malcolm X
Becoming an icon is very deep.. In my mind always..
Niggas plotting... Plotting!!
But I'm paying attention...
Niggas wish they had what I got...
They some birds now listen
To my words I'm for telling I'm a profit
Nigga losing ain't an option
Cause I'm mobbin, bitch we mobbin because

[Verse 2: Bigal Harrison]
As I got older, the world got colder
It's frigid in the city you good if you rocking wit me (OH)
Friends turn to enemies, but smiling in my face
I just looked at all my brothers said "it time to get this cake" (YEAH)
This the life that we chose, ain't no way a nigga turn back now
Hating niggas changed they opinion about me, cause I'm blessed now
Fuck that shit that you barking, I'm just ending all the speculation
I'ma be around forever thats what you call that (FUCKING GREATNESS!)
