[Verse 1: fla$h]
It's just a wonderful world ain't it ..
Same mindset as Picasso before he painted
Everything abstract
This is straight from the soul not the psychical aspect
I'm breaking down to pieces but I'm keeping everything intact
It's amazing . young legend in the making feeling like this whole wide world is for the taking
But the biggest lesson in life is patience
Cause the world still turns slow
And these blunts still burn slow
And this pain still hurts so
So We got more blunts yo
So we got more blunts thou
So we got more blunts
(Ok)
And we keep about a pound
And we smoke it by the hour
And we do this everyday like our lungs got superpowers

And I swear to god I ain't worrying bout another niggas cheddar
I got good fellas that's down make it rain led showers like its may weather
And I got hay-makers like mayweather
And I get paid paper on the money team like I'm Floyd mayweather (cashing out)
And all my niggas stay fly cause we birds of the same feather
Niggas asking me will I change wit the fame ? And I say NEVER
Never shared the same Endeavors
Wit these common niggas
I'm so hot I could change tempers
I'm the greatest mistake like when a dj first scratched a record
And I'm climbing up the charts and I'm scratching every record
You not even in my repertoire I could eat you up just for breakfast
Nigga that's food for thought
Brain food and you food for sure
And I bet you was that fool who thought .. I could never make it , it's time I proved you wrong
But go Keep hating
And keep wishing like a shooting star
While I'm getting green like a cabbage patch
I'll trade it all away like some damage snacks at lunchtime
But it's crunch time and I promise I could handle that
And I'm painting vivid pictures so where the fucks my canvas at
Cause I'm really going ham like a sandwich wrap
Ever since I kicked it the competition went missing damn it's sad
And I'm burning up these tracks like candle wax
And like a body builder I'm just here to flex
And these hating niggas like damn u next
You might also like
[Chorus: Fla$h]
But I'm kicking flows coming straight from the soul
What I spit They'll never know
How I feel They'll never know
And this pain inside is something I'll never show
But I'm kicking flows coming straight from the soul
But I'm kicking flows..... Straight from the soul


[Verse 2: Fla$h]
Posted on the block all black with a hoodie
Looking like a bunch of hoodlums hanging out where we shouldn't
And my niggas got backpacks with all of the goodies
Meet me by the corner and make sure nobody looking
Cause niggas don't wanna end up at central bookings
Nigga that's real shit
These D.Ts pick a nigga up real quick
With no remorse , slow down nigga hold your horse
Never let a motherfucker throw u off your course
This sour got me feeling a frozen corpse
Coming back from the future no capsule corp
The king in this bitch so open up the castle doors
And all these bitches give me what I'm asking for
And we play tennis wit the blunts cause it keep going back and forth
And this a whole new wave so go get ya paddle boards
And if u dick-riding
That's what I keep the saddle for
So saddle up
All these bitches bad as fuck
So I had to fuck
Just blowing up cause I had the luck you you can't get a scrape from my plate let alone a platter bruh
Pissing on niggas like I had a weak bladder bruh
I was shitted on for too long Now I had enough
Nobody helped me when times was rough and it mattered son
I ain't even mad no more cause the way shit turning out it's there lost
Like they bad at sports
What's the point of bragging for
I just be in the cut blowing out smoke like a dragons roar
All these bitches who slept on me woke up and now they mad as fuck
Cause I'm gone and there's no catching up
Fuck a bone make these bitches go fetch a blunt
And if they wanna play catch I make em catch a nut
Ain't nobody out here fresh as us
Ain't no half steppers stepping next to us
I could do this shit in my sleep that's an OBE til I D.i.e niggas fronting on the K.i.d but they can not speak
Giving vision to the blind
Fixing the E .y. e s .of who can not see
Everybody could get a mental p.i.c . That's why these hoes bandwagon on my D. I .C
Everybody's the same
There's no difference
If hip hops dead I'm at the crime scene looking for forensics
So basically I'm avenging my whole existence
Lately my friends been a little more distant
I've been on my grind and my circles getting tight so I don't even miss them
It's sad to say I don't even miss them
That's food for the mind go ahead eat it up
Niggas is season just like the trees is
Son
And I feel one wit the world cause I put these trees in blunts
And I burn it down make it hit straight to the soul


[Chorus: Fla$h]
But I'm kicking flows coming straight from the soul
What I spit They'll never know
How I feel They'll never know
And this pain inside is something I'll never show
But I'm kicking flows coming straight from the soul
But I'm kicking flows..... Straight from the soul
