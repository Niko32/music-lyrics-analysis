I'm attracted to the city
Men all suited, sexy booted
Walking down a Liverpool Street
I'd be seein' magic mountains
Cash beginneth to rip a bigger
Hole inside the American dream

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Gimme dollar, gimme dollar
Queen 'Lizabeth stole my dough
Give me heads and give me tails and
Give me yen and give me gold
Give me diamonds and gold
Give me diamonds and gold
The dollar book and cash gold
Dollar book and cash gold
We want diamonds and dough, dough, dough, ooh

[Chorus 1]
Give me the money
Give me the money, oh!
'Cause this is where the diamonds grow
Give me the money
Give me the money, oh!
So that a jewel can be sown
Yeah (yeah) ohh-ohh-ohhh

I'd be dreamin' of lagoons and
Swimming pools of liquid jewels cause
I'm a sucker for things that be gleamin', yeah
Beware of women who come runnin'
They see bling-bling, they think ka-ching!
Family jewels from fools need protectin'

[Pre-Chorus 2]
They say "We want dollar, give me dollar
Give me queens and give me dough
We give head if you give tail 'cause
We need yen and we need gold"
We want diamonds and gold
Give me diamonds and gold
The dollar book and cash gold
Dollar book and cash gold
We want diamonds and dough, ooh

[Chorus 1]
Give me the money
Give me the money, oh!
'Cause this is where the diamonds grow
Give me the money
Give me the money, oh!
So that a jewel can be sown
[Chorus 2]
Give me the money
Give me the money, oh!
'Cause this is where the diamonds grow
Forget the Midas
I've got the diamond touch
Diamonds are worth more than gold
Yeah (yeah), ohh-ohh-ohhh
(Yeah) Yeah, ohh-ohh-ohhh

[Outro]
You'd be kidding yourself
If you said that you didn't want it
And I'd be kidding myself
If I said I didn't think I'd be rich, yeah!

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ah
