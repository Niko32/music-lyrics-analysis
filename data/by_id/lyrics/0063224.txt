I am not dangerous I am danger
I am abominable stress, Eliotic, relentless
I’m a breath of vengeance. I’m a death sentence
I’m forsaken repentance to the beast in his hench men
Armed forces and police men that survived of oils and prisons until their cup runneth over with lost souls
That wear over sized caps like blind folds
Shiny necklaces like lasso’s
Dragging them into black holes
And I may have to holla at Fidel Castro
To get my other brothers outta Guantanamo

And the innocents on death row
Is probably in the same proportion as the criminals in black robes
That smack gavels that crack domes
That smack gavels that smash homes

Justice is somewhere between reading sad poems
And 40 ounces of gasoline crashing through windows
Justice is between plans and action
Between writing letters to Congressmen and clapping the captain
Between raising legal defense funds
And putting a gun on the bailiff and taking the judge captive
It is between prayer and fasting
Between burning and blasting
Freedom is between the mind and the soul
It is between the lock and the load
Between the zeal of the young and the patience of the old
Freedom is between the finger and the trigger
It is between the page and the pen
Between the grenade and the pin
Between righteous anger and keeping one in the chamber
So what can they do with a cat with a heart like Turner
A mind like Douglas, a mouth like Malcolm, and a voice like KRS?
You might also likeAnd that is why I am not dangerous I am danger
I am not angry I am anger
I am abominable stress, illiotic relentless
I’m a breath of vengeance. I’m a death sentence
I’m forsaken repentance to the beast in his hench men
Armed forces and police men
I will slice his belly open and
Free
The souls of the Navajo
The souls of the Iroquois
The souls of the Ibo
The souls of the Scottsboro boys
The souls of great Black leaders
The souls of Kandahar and Baghdad
I burn my white and raise my black flag
To free the souls of the great black leaders
The souls in Attica
The piece of solace on the prison floor

Until then I am not dangerous I am danger
I am not angry I am anger
I am abominable stress, illiotic relentless
I’m a breath of vengeance. I’m a death sentence
I’m forsaken repentance to the beast in his hench men
Politicians and big business men
I’m a teenage Palestinian opening fire at an Israeli check point
Point blank
Checkmate
Now what!

I am an inmate short shanked to the c-o
Earlobe to earlobe
Cut short
Case closed
Now what

I am Sitting Bull with Colonel Custer’s scalp in my hands
I am Cinqué with a slave trader’s blood in my hands
I am Jonathan Jackson handing a gun to my man
I am David with a sling shot and a rock
And if David lived today it would be a Molotov cocktail and a Glock
So I say down with Goliath
I say down with Goliath

But we must learn, know, write, read
We must kick, bite, yell, scream
We must pray, fast, live, dream
Fight, kill, and die free
