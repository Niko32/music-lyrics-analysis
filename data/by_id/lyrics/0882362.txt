Determined i'm committed
That i'll run
No matter the cost

And I have decided
Determined i'm committed
That i'll run
Even though at times I may get lost

I'm going to finish my race
I'm going to take my proper place
In the winning circle

I'm going to run anyway
I dont know where or when or how
But I know that i'm going to make it

Oh i'll run
This race
Nestled safetly in amazing grace
I've made up my mind
And I dont have much time
But i'll run, Til I Finish
