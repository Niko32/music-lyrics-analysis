Another classic from... The GOAT
You ain't ready
Uh

[Verse 1]
It's done and over,in fact It's bout time I told ya'
That I'm gettin real tired of your shit and its becoming old bruh
Whats my motive, this guy bitches so fucking i can't focus
So its poison to my ears whether or not you know it
I'm bout to blow up I'm now explosive, youre gettin roasted
This very moment your gettin' slept, comatose its
A dose of your own medicine, you're cabbage you're lettuce and
I recommend that you bow down and obey your king. you're the fucking peasant, bitch
This ain't no apprenticeship, im always right check my pentmenship
Effortlessly represent my thoughts of you as if i really give a shit
W-o-a-t ain't we supposed to be friends? why you hating
Lately, seems like you've been blatantly acting shady
I spent the past few days debating on whether or not i should make this song
To put but this bitch back in his place, back where he belongs
Fuck you greg you Teran dick riding mother fucker
Shut the fuck up Greg just shut the fuck up

[HOOK]
Im Slaughtering each and everyone of opponents violently
Im destroying the competition as i keep laughing maniacly
Its finally the time to start taking over unsilently
Im laughing maniacally haha laughing maniacally
Your time is up, give it up, its over now
This victory is my hands, thats the plan, now ill throw it down
Talked that shit, that's what you did, what you spoke was brown
You are done, your time has come, tell me how it is below the ground

Second verse i feel the urge to look back at some memories
Like how you couldn't get on your fucking xbox whenever we
Wanted to get on. shit that was months long. enough bout you being grounded
For real though you spent my money on Oreo's just cuz you found it
Thats pathetic. i reflected on that moment like fuck that Greg kid
Heck it it could've all been avoided if id just  neglect him
Shit, speaking of neglection you'd say I wann get on Netflix
Im going to single handedly destroy josh and Terans  competitive efforts
