Disguise, distorted like moonlit seas
And I see
You've taken all you need
Queue up, don't fear
There's mans new fortune here, you hear

Song-birds, recycling the same old tune
Still you slave onwards, 'til all is used
Though I'll see
You'll get the life you need
Queue up, don't fear it's the man who brought you here, you hearYou might also like
