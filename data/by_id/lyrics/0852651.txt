And I've come to conclude
That you've been takin' things that really don't belong to you
Sit down, better yet get out
And now you actin' up
'Cause you know that I'm on to you
And now I'm 'bout to tell you what you're gonna do
Get out, get out, out my house
Don't want you on my porch no more
Stop looking through my window open
'Cause you're my enemy and not my friend
(Not my friend)
I can see clearly and I don't
Wanna hear you on my radio
Don't wanna see you on my TV screen
Don't wanna read you in my magazine
(Movie scene)
You need to hear me
(You know you're wrong)
Tryin' to run them games on me
(And you know you're wrong)
Tryin' to put them chains on me
(I need you gone gone gone gone gone)
I need you gone, gone, I need you gone
So now you're gonna have to yield the floor
And one thing more
I'm gonna have to show you to the door
And when you go
(And when you go please stay away)
(Get out my house)
I don't ever want to have to see your face round here no more
(Get out my house, out my house, out my house)
(You need to get out my house)
I don't ever want to have to see you come around here no more
(Get out my house, out my house, out my house)
Stop messin' with my family
I'm takin' back what you stole from me
'Cause now, I'm living in victory
And you don't scare me, I'll tell you why
God is for me so I'm not afraid
My escape is already made
And His life it was the price He paid
(Price He paid)
And now you're under my feet
(You know you're wrong)
Tryin' to run them games on me
(And you know you're wrong)
Tryin' to put them chains on me
(I need you gone gone gone gone gone)
I need you gone, gone, I need you gone
So now you're gonna have to yield the floor
And one thing more
I'm gonna have to show you to the door
And when you go
(And when you go please stay away)
I need you gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I just really need you gone, gone, gone, gone
So now I have to tell you so long
It was all wrong and what I don't want
Is you to ever come back 'cause I'm
Not in the mood to negotiate, I know
God is for me and I'm not afraid
Gone, gone, gone, gone
And when you go and when you go please stay away
(You know you're wrong)
Tryin' to run them games on me
(And you know you're wrong)
Tryin' to put them chains on me
(I need you gone gone gone gone gone)
I need you gone, gone, I need you gone
So now you're gonna have to yield the floor
And one thing more
I'm gonna have to show you to the door
And when you go
(And when you go please stay away)You might also like
