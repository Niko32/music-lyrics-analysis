You can't even see me at all
Oh, you look like an angel out of place
At this downtown devil's bar

Do you wanna dance girl
You said no thanks
And I watched you drift away
Well you had your chance

You could've been the one
Tonight you could've been the only one
For the rest of my life
I'll be dreamin' of you when this dance is done
Knowin' you could've been the one

If I come back here I might see you again
And maybe you'd say yes
But it's a losin' game I'm tryin' to win
And I can only guess

Do you have somebody (watchin')
Who watches you
As you let down your hair
By the light of the moon
You might also likeYou could've been the one
Tonight you could've been the only one
For the rest of my life
I'll be dreamin' of you when this dance is done
Knowin' you could've been the one
Knowin' you could've been the one

Where do you go when the night ends
Are you just a dream that fades into gray
Visions of you will not leave me alone
Why did you have to turn away

You could've been the one
Tonight you could've been the only one
For the rest of my life
I'll be dreamin' of you when this dance is done
Knowin' you could've been the one

Tonight you could've been the only one
For the rest of my life
I'll be dreamin' of you when this dance is done
Knowin' you could've been the one ...
