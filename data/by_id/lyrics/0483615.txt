This isn't bout' morals or a mere lesson
This is news for all of you to view no need for questions
I am sure of what i say there is no second guessing so
There's this little youngin' livin' out his dreams
He can write he can sing to everyone its what it seems
His life from good to worse supplied by pain and some hurt
He needs to find a way to lift up from this wicked curse uh
Impossible it seems, there's no sign of relief
No on one to tie his shoes cause life keeps tearin' at the seams
Breakin' down his dreams
To God he turns to plead
To lift up with all his might
And all of his bravery so
From the burbs to The Wood
Still he treats his girl so good
Confused of what he can or should
Due to all the hardness of his friends
All his partners all his kin
Mother Father kicked him to the curb like he was garbage

She said I love you with my heart
But i say her love was tarnished
When you betrayed me mom i thought you were nothin' but heartless
But Its okay Imma do my thing doin' what i need to do
Through all the midst and pain just know i still got love for you Ah!
No this is not a crime this is just the game of life
You just gotta learn to play it right and in due time I'm sure you'll find...
The succession to your heart
Stick wit it and I'm sure your life will never fall apart, D_StaxxYou might also like
