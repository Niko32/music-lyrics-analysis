[Two earphones in whilst shes breathing
Not stalking but stalling a release
Patterned therapy breathe out like a sunflower]

You werent supposed to grow up this quickly
I wasn't supposed to bring you down with me
I wanted to party in my own company
I want to dance with myself with me
Ill be pure with you ill suck ill fuck then ill duck
Seal the silicone seams of your stomach
Ill be pure with you ill suck ill fuck then ill duck
Seal the silicone seams of your stomach

[Two earphones in whilst shes breathing
Not stalking but stalling a release
Patterned therapy breathe out like a sunflower]

Two earphones in a while one earphone out
So she can listen to his breathing not stalking but stalling
A release patterned therapy
Breathe in breathe out like a sunflower
And unwavering attraction discreetly
Another earphone out as hes leaving
She stays internally bleeding
Pastel skinned fruit juiceless girls dried passionless skies
Stable bark plain glass and medicine paved paths
I get seasick when we drive through the rain
My sympathy no longer splits and shares the same

Eternally bleeding as my feet face my ceiling
She ain't discrete then fields in holidays
Skin on skin thats the only way
All those words you dont have to speak or say
I know theres no way i wanna lie and not lay to yesterday
Breathe in not out mirror glances and lip pose pouts
Imagine the children in the battles screams no shouts
All screams no shouts
All screams no shouts
All screams no shouts
All screams
