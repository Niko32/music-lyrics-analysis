Lord, there is none like you
All of my days i want to praise
The wonders of your might love
My comfort, my shelter
Tower of refuge and strength
Let every breath, all that i am
Never cease to worship you
Shout to the lord
All the earth, let us sing
Power and majesty
Praise to the king
Mountains bow down
And the seas will roar
At the sound of your name
I sing for joy
At the work of your hands
Forever i'll love you
Forever i'll stand
Nothing compares
To the promise i have in youYou might also like
