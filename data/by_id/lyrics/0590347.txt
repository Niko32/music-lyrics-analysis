Even though I couldn't tell.
No shutters, no sleep, it follows you under.

You were so stupid last time.
Don't you see how beautiful this moment could be.
Look at the sky, look at the color.
I've got my green dress on.
I am not pure, my face is made up.
Implacable, torrid lust.
Without shadow, without shelter.
