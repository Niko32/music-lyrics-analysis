If only she knew that she'd take it this far
Like a leaf without a tree she lost her roots
Tell me where they ignore you
In your world of fiction
You'll meet fact rolling like a train so thanks for the chat
Thanks for the chat

Chorus
We all do what we do, just to get by
We all see what we see, not to ask why
We will look the other way, when you walk by
So don't ask us tomorrow, who did the crime?

So this girl from Athens claims she's the one
That told all the big guns to go where she's from
Come down off your thrown before we knock you down
In a pool of lies you're gonna drown, you're gonna drown

So this girl from Athens walks in here
She knows she's all that minus her fears
Bringing me down seems to be her game
She knows now who is to blame
For all the rejections that she will face
Maybe one day she can stand in my place, stand in my placeYou might also like
