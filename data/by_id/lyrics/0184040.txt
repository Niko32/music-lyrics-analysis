And I don’t normally do this, so whose this?
I’m just tryna move moods through the music
And tell you Miss, that what you do makes me lose it

It’s not just that your ideal, although that’s part of the appeal
But it’s also the feel, that what we have could be real
Real amazing, cuz I was living vacant
-now you’re here and I see all the time I was wasting

Now you’re making me wave like you’re lunar
So fly, I’m out of breath, like a pair of parachuters
Oh I, didn’t know cupid was a sharpshooter
Had some problems with the last girl, you probably heard the rumors

I’m not insisting that you have to be the new her
I’m admitting that you got me forgetting I ever knew her
Like who’s her? Should have met you sooner
Yet I’m at a loss for words, probably looking like a loser

Like, like, like, like hey
I really like the way, that you brighten my day
When you're smiling at J, I be fighting off saying
That them others guys eyes got me mighty dismayed

Cuz everybody wants you, but promise I’m the one who
Isn’t just in it to be on you, then gone soon
But I’m ready to be everything you let me
Cuz I’ve been sprung. Chest feeling heavy like a tansu
You might also likeIf you ask me that seems a little sappy
So I’ll cut the similes and simply say you make me happy
You are such an athlete, running through my mind
I am thinking track meet, and you run a good time

I’m sorry if these impositions seem, ill-receiveced
I’m just timid, cuz I fear you might feel differently
But tell me if your feelings be in symmetry
With my own, so we can go to where that good living be

Yeah, Sir Real J
