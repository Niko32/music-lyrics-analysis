When you ask yourself these questions, just know and understand that, its a lot of us asking the same questions with you
So don't be afraid to wonder and question why things ain't perfect and why things don't always line up the way you plan them
Don't be scared to ask, a whole lot of things i don't wanna know (hah)

[Verse 1]
I just wanna know what my purpose is, will i ever win or am i just living out worthless years
Can i conquer the heaviness of my nervous fears, when will i ever stop saturating the earth with tears
Tryna overfix a problem only makes it worse, don't ya hate when you do something you can't reverse
Ive worn down every shoe I've put my foot in, when will i finally win for all this hard work that I've put in
How come its so easy to fall in love with people, but so hard to overcome the pain once they leave you
Generosity died when we discovered greed, being negligent and bad and thinking of my seeds
(See) Material things we love indeed, how come we constantly put our wants above our needs
I'm tryna learn I ain't tryna harass they say the only stupid question is the one you don't ask

[Hook]
So i just wanna know how it looks how it feels to be living in a state of peace surrounded by the real
I just wanna know before its all said and done will i ever cash in, will my time ever come
Money don't make me, please don't diffuse it, you with me when i got it but you're gone when i lose it
I feel bad cause I did wrong in the past, I don't mind a little struggle but how long do it last

[Verse 2]
Ive got my own load to carry I can shoulder that, tryna help unappreciative people, I'm over that
They just wanna try and get a piece of what you're holding back, keep me in their circle like a house in a culdesac
After the breakup, seems like my ex is wiser, I saw her acting so polite i barely recognized her
I argued hard to teach her who she was and who she wasn't, i guess my job to train her for her future husband
I ain't sure of your intentions though im seeing clues, do you ever get the feeling that you're being used
I can't how many times I've been wrong in life, I ain't always right, sometimes i question my own advice
When I'm on the outside i wish that i was in, and once I'm in ( i see there's that nothing i wanna leave again. )?
Cause what good is increasing my wealth, if I'm wrestling everyday to find peace with myself

[Verse 3]
How come the real souls just got no one to ride for em. Why do we worship shoes so much we sleep outside for em. (foolish)
Deception even in religion now the church is proof, how come we'd rather live in ignorance then search for truth
I say the hood done lost hope and i bet ya whatever, a church on every corner but its more wretched then ever
The dope man getting money at a faster rate, liquor stores too and they don't even gotta pass the plate
Without movement or change we'll never be free exactly, what makes another person mad when they see you happy
Don't tell God how big your problems are the world is his, flip it around tell your problems how big God is
Whats up with the hate on every dime we try to make, i just wanna know how many more beatings we gotta take
When we gonna learn that they don't want us to populate, mustard seeds are real small it don't take a lot so
