The landlord's here to visit
They're blasting disco down below
Says, "I'm doubling the rent
'Cause the building's condemned
You're gonna help me buy City Hall"

[Chorus]
But we can, you know we can
But we can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord, man

[Verse 2]
I tell them, "Turn on the water"
I tell 'em, "Turn on the heat"
Tells me, "All you ever do is complain," yeah
Then they search the place when I'm not here

[Chorus]
But we can, you know we can
We can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord, man

[Guitar Solo]
You might also like[Verse 3]
There's rats chewin' up the kitchen
Roaches up to my knees
Turn the oven on, it smells like Dachau, yeah
'Til the rain pours through the ceiling

[Chorus]
But we can, you know we can
We can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord, man

[Outro]
The landlord, man
