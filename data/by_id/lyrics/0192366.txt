Leave me alone, I'm over it
And everybody's movin' on
I can't see my tomorrow, and yesterday has come and gone
So leave me alone

[Verse 2]
My mind is blown, but it's my own, so deal with it
I'm feeling fine most of the time
I may be on the outside, but no one's gettin' in
So leave me alone

[Chorus]
We're okay, reelin' in the days
We're alright, we're just getting high
Let us be, it'll be alright

[Verse 3]
I got no strife, I'm loving life, could you say the same?
You don't have to move to groove
So come on up and see me, but leave that judge behind
'Cause I'm lovin' life

[Chorus]
We're okay, reeling in the days
We're alright, we're just gettin' high
Let us be, it'll be alright
You might also like[Chorus]
We're okay, reelin' in the days
We're alright, we're just getting high
Let us be, it will be alright

[Bridge]
I'm getting stoned, and what's wrong with that?
The president seems to be just fine
Come on up and see me, come on up, just know that
I'm gettin' stoned, I'm gettin' stoned
I'm gettin' stoned, I'm gettin' stoned

[Chorus]
We're okay, reelin' in the days
We're alright, we're just getting high
Let us be, it'll be alright

[Outro]
It'll be alright
It'll be alright
