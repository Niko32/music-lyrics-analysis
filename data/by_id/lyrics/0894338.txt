It makes me believe
The best is still yet to come
And I don't want to leave
Forgive my hesitation, oh but I'm learning to trust in you
Help me to dream these dreams
Because I don't have a clue

And if you'd be honest and say what you mean
You know I would promise I'd do anything
Because I know that without you I'm giving it away

Is this what you wanted?
'Cause I'm willing to change
Now that I'm certain
There's much more to gain
You've introduced me to the moment
But I'm looking to stay for good
You asked me to stay forever
Well, you know that
I would, I would do anything

If you'd be honest and say what you mean you know
I would promise I'd do anything
Because I know that without you I'm giving it away
You might also likeThe nights are forever and maybe I'm wrong
But it feels like I'm so lost without you
So I step towards the heat, it's the way I can see
And it makes me believe that it's you

And by the way you brought me here it makes me believe the best is still yet to come
And I don't want to leave, I won't, but anyway...

If you'd be honest and say what you mean you know
I would promise I'd do anything
Because I know that without you I'm giving it away

The nights are forever
I can't get to sleep cause I know there's a reason
I'm in this too deep and I'm sure that without you
I'm giving it away
Yeah

Woo Hoo
I'm Giving it away...
Giving it away...
Giving it away..
