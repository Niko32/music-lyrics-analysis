Or play a part in what's meant to be
I control what my heart thinks
Or is it just like gunpowder

No one is listening
Just taking what they're given
That will never be me

We're all firecracker people
Going off all the time
The empire keeps pulling
Beautiful spark out of time

Look how the sun shines for me
I have a mind for industry
I need another with big dreams
Louis vuitton and mercedes
An eye for the finer things

The city light keep pulling
I'm standing still and moving
And the tubes are glowing

We're all firecracker people
Going off all the time
Everywhere i go, you'll be
Beautiful spark out of time
You might also likeWhat does love have to offer me
I don't think i believe
Could there be someone who'll inspire me
Or is it just the dream i dream

Who's gonna prove it different
When everyone's pretending
And the research is showing

We're all firecracker people
Going off all the time
The empire keeps pulling
Beautiful spark out of time

Will you ever notice me
Will my heart remain incomplete
You're the driftwood, i'm the sea
Maybe in time you'll learn to see
Oh, i believe

Like a fuse burning slowly
You're miles away, i'm within reach
I am here patiently

We're all firecracker people
Going off all the time
Everywhere i go, you'll be
Beautiful spark out of time
We're all firecracker people
Every thought i'll ever know
You're the only thing that i see
Beautiful spark out of time
