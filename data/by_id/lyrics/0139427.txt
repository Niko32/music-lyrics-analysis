They around when you rise
But disappear when you fall
Girls you used to love never answering you calls
And fake friends all of sudden acting diffrent
Shit It makes me wonder  the fuck am I  even missing
Nobody believed  in my dreams atheists
But next year bet they turn themselves Christian
Spilling my soul I just hope somebody listen
I just hope somebody listen
So broke couldn't afford to take the train
Even to buy umbrellas when it's pouring in the rain
Lost both of  my jobs
Now life is getting hard
I'm jottin 012
As the worst year of my life
Barely remember the last time i even had my shit tight
Now Everybody suddenly dropping me from they lives
Pretending like y'all don't know me
Y'all niggas is phony
Cause when I was good y'all was the first ones in line

And these phony bitches is gonna put me behind
So you walk around  like you don't know who I am
Like you dont Know who I am
Damn
I guess that's how it is
I lost it  all and everything
I swear to god  im taken it back
And even more
Feel my pain
All of these niggas stayed the same
While I just changed
When I come back
I' promise
I'll be the kingYou might also like
