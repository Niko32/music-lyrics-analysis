She used to be so ignorant
She wasted all the time she spent
(Doin' all her homework)
She wasn't where her girlfriends went

But since I showed her what's inside
She left her girlish ways behind
I used to work from 9 to 5
But now I'm working overtime

When I get home from work
It's never the same
Don't ask me how to explain
(You know I never complain)
She loves me once
And then she loves me again
Cause she's so wild

You know she's got her way with me
You know she gives me everything
She gives me everything I need
She's everything a girl can be

She always meets me at the door
She always wants to give me more
She drags me down onto the floor
I never know just what's in store
You might also likeWhen I get home from work
It's never the same
Don't ask me how to explain
(You know I never complain)
She loves me once
And then she loves me again
Cause she's so wild

But since I showed her what's inside
She left her girlish ways behind
I used to work from 9 to 5
But now I'm working overtime

When I get home from work
It's never the same
Don't ask me how to explain
(You know I never complain)
She loves me once
And then she loves me again
Cause she's so wild
