I am a jungle, a mastermind
It's not the time
I'll rip it out, I'll go in debt
I'm figured out
And you can see
Just what I need
Just who I am
A solemn tiger
It's so so fresh
Inside my breath
And all I need
And all I breathe
Is all in me
I am a jungle, a mastermind
It's not the time

[Verse 2]
My love is able to
Inside my able mind
Nothing you say to me
Will hurt me any time
You cannot see me now
I'm off inside my mind
I will not speak to you
I will not find the timeYou might also like
