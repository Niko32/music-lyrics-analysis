Holding you throughout the night
I thought you'd always care

I know that feelings change
And now you've thrown away
The love that we once shared

They said it would be so easy
They told me how I'd find someone new
Don't you think you'll ever need me like I need you

I'm losing, losing my heart over you
I'm losing, losing my heart over you

I know you never had the time
To know this heart of mine
I need to feel your love

And now it always seems
Day and night I have these dreams
It's you I'm thinking of

I know it sounds so foolish
Here I am with a broken heart
Oh, why, can't I be with someone like you
You might also likeI'm losing, losing my heart over you
I'm losing, losing my heart over you

I know it sounds so foolish
Here I am with a broken heart
Oh, why, can't I be with someone like you

I'm losing, losing my heart over you
I'm losing, losing my heart over you
I'm losing, losing my heart over you
I'm losing, losing my heart over you
