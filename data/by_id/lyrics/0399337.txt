That woman's got a smile
Puts you in a trance
And just one look at her
Makes you want to dance
Those dark an rosy lips
Only passify
With just a hint of ruthlessness
Sparkling in her eye

[Chorus]
She's a teaser, and she's got no heart at all
She's a teaser, and she'll tempt you until you

[Verse 2]
Yes she'll tempt you 'til you fall
She'll talk to you in riddles
That have no sense, or rhyme
And if you ask her what she means
She says, she don't got no time

[Chorus]
She's a teaser, and she's got no heart at all
She's a teaser, and she'll tempt you until you
Yes she'll tempt you until you fall
You might also likeShe's a teaser, and she's got no heart at all
She's a teaser, and she'll tempt you until you
Yes she'll tempt you until you fall
