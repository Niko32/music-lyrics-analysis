It just doesn't mean a thing
Speak to me slowly
It just doesn't mean a thing

'Cause no one ever goes out in the winter
Spirit never grows out in the winter
Everyone knows the sun never shows until the end of winter

Frozen water fountains
It just doesn't mean a thing
Snow-covered mountains
It just doesn't mean a thing

'Cause no one ever goes out in the winter
A spirit never grows out in the winter
Everyone knows the sun never shows until the end of winter

In December I remember
You never get too old to want to see the stars come down

[Guitar lead]

I feel cold and lonely
It just doesn't mean a thing
Speak to me slowly
It just doesn't mean a thing

'Cause no one ever goes out in the winter
Spirit never grows out in the winter
Everyone knows the sun never shows until the end of winter
