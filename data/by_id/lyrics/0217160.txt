Don't want to fall in love when it's in front of us
Why can't we dream? Fantasize without compromise
A tear duct short of an alibi
Please thaw me out, and brush me off
Is love is quite the fallacy
Underneath the mystery?


[Chorus]
So you finally came right out of my head and into my arms
Now these feelings I know, I'll never let go
I've beaten the game


[VERSE 2: ACTION ACTION]
My alter ego's upstairs strung out on the couch
I need a touch of innocence so comfortable
So velvet lush and nectarines
There is a price to pay for dreaming
Is love an emergency?
Join in my perplexity

[Chorus]
