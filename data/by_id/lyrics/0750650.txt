Today's the day I find my place
Ready to move
But still I think of you

And I'm hoping that you'll be there
(at four in the morning, four in the morning)
I'm hoping that you'll be there

Down the road I make my way
Done my time to you I race
Ready to move
But still I think of you

And I'm hoping that you'll be there
(at four in the morning, four in the morning)
I'm hoping that you'll be there

Getting closer to you
I'm thinking hard what to say
I pray that you haven't changed
So please be there

And I'm hoping that you'll be there
Hoping that you'll be there
I'm hoping that you'll be there
(At four in the morning, four in the morning)
I'm hoping that you'll be there
(Hoping that you'll be there)
I'm hoping that you'll be thereYou might also like
