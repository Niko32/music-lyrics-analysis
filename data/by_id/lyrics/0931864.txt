These thoughts of you control my mind
A love I can't shake as I lie awake tonight
This is different from the rest
It's more than a feeling or a second guess
'Cause I can't breathe till you're holding me again

'Cause this is love, keeping me awake tonight
This is love, I can't free You from my mind
'Cause I've never felt apart
Of something greater than myself until now
I'm waking up 'cause this is love

I have to be with you
'Cause I can't make it on my own
My fears are forgotten
When I'm standing here with you

So where do we go from here?
They say the future's so unclear
But I don't care, I'll go anywhere with you
I'll go anywhere, we can go anywhere

'Cause this is love, keeping me awake tonight
This is love, I can't free You from my mind
'Cause I've never felt apart
Of something greater than myself until now
Oh, I'm waking up
You might also likeTo a love I can't deny
You are the dawn that breaks the night
You have my heart, You have everything
'Cause this is love

'Cause this is love, keeping me awake tonight
This is love, I can't free You from my mind
'Cause I've never felt apart
Of something greater than myself until now
Oh, I'm waking up

This is love, oh
This is love, oh
'Cause this is love
'Cause this is love
