Yesterday I saw a whore
Lookin' out for more
While she makes my body ache
Still, I watch it and I say

[Verse 1: Ras MG]
Ah well, uh
I'm on the mic doin', uh
The things you like and I'm, uh
Ras M.G. and I'll, uh
Treat you right
'Cause all the ladies and me
You see we both agree
That, uh, I'm goin' down in world history, yo

[Chorus: Bradley Nowell]
Oh, she makes body ache
And you know I yearn for more
I won't flake or perpetrate
I won't front no funky hoe

[Verse 2: Ras MG]
Don't get me wrong I'm just, uh
Singing my song, I'm just like you
I like to ball my freaks all night long
Not only do I rhyme, I also cut so nice
And all the fighting perpetrating DJ's want my slice
'Cause I'm select
You might also like[Verse 3: Bradley Nowell]
Perpetrate DJâ€™s, come and look for me
Rock me, rub-a-dub, rock and roll MC
So sweet and so nice
They call me delight
(Go, ah, go, ah, go, ah, go, ah, go, ah)

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4: Eric Wilson]
(Think of something man, sing something)
My name is Eric, I have nothing to say
'Cause I am not a fucking DJ
And if you wanna come talk to me
Then you gotta talk to my man Bradley

[Verse 5: Ras MG]
Uh, uh, elected
My rhymes will be perfected
The fighting MC's will be dissected and rejected
I am the most impressive
Inspective and progressive
Motivating, innovating, chillin' and digested
It's obvious as ever
It will be specialized
If you're trying to proclaim, uh
Can't be compromised
I am a fresh MC
As you can plainly see
You won't regret a DJ fresh, I'm sure you'll soon agree
So take a seat and feel the beat, of course it is okay, uh, uh
Not Judgment Day
[Outro: Bradley Nowell]
Yes, I still rock M.C
Yo, you're not jumpin' Jay
That's right, we outta here
5000 G, 5000 G
We outta here, we outta here (Peace)
Peace, nothing but peace and unity
Seen love and no fightin', boy, in the middle
(All right)
