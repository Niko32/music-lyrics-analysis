It doesn't make us strong
It doesn't make us weak
Tongue tied disservice
Like shy pre-teens
I could only breathe
Live to believe
I'm alone

It didn't come easy
I'm glad it was hard
Worth the wait
To give you my heart

[Chorus]
Big teeth small kiss
I turn to wax and melt like this
Melt like this

[Verse 2]
I found you in pieces
You'd been torn apart
A million one reasons to end before you start
But deep down I knew
No matter what in the end
It'd be me and you
You might also like[Chorus]
Big teeth small kiss
I turn to wax and melt like this
Melt like this

[Post-Chorus]
Lavender haze
Djarum vanilla
Turkish jade
You and me
We have it made
We have it made

[Bridge]
Caress my knees with your tongue
Teeth on my waist I come undone
It's those hours in the night
Just before a light
Run your hand down my spine
We kiss the dusk goodnight
Goodnight

[Chorus]
Big teeth small kiss
I turn to wax and melt like this
Melt like this
[Post-Chorus]
Lavender haze
Djarum vanilla
Turkish jade
You and me
We have it made
We have it made
