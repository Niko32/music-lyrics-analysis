I tried to fit myself into the box you made for me
But try and try as much as you like it's not a reality
You said I wasn't good enough and that's a game I just won't play
But hell'll freeze over before I believe it cus I am here to stay
Put water on the seed watch it grow
Fuel on the fire watch it blow

[Chorus:]
Gotta get the wait off my back
Say it like it is when I want to
You gotta work harder than that
You can bet that I'm better than you
I#m leading the pack
Everything is coming up roses
If you wanna bring it I ain't scared just bring it ohhh
You can bet that I'm better, bet that I'm better than you

[Verse II:]
Fool you underestimate but look whose laughing now
I've got a fire burning deep so deep you can't put me out
With my army of believers here now we can touch the stars
So you thought I would crumble infact I just raised the bar
Put wonder in you eyes say it's so
Fuel on the fire watch it blow
You might also like[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Na na na na na na na na na!

[Chorus]
