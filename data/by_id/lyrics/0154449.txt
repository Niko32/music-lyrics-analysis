Shutup
Cause I'm good
Shutup!
Too good
Just rap

[Verse One]
If I would had the grind I have now four years ago.
I could be in a whole 'nother spot, maybe- selling out shows
Shelling out mo' cash as I take the bus on the road
I'll get there in due time. You think not. But lo!
Noticed by those that got some rep in the game
They should give me my props. I want my fame
But not for the reasons you'd think. Take a second glance
So I can change the biz. So I can give that chance
To that little girl who got the same starts in her eyes as me
Or that college kid, the next Nas, posting his mixtape in his feed
Promo from tweets. Just want some asses in the seats
Give it time to pay off. Victory is sweet. Jeh watch!

[Hook]
I'm not the same. remember the name
Unknown is lame. So give me the fame
I'm not the same. Remember the name
Unknown is lame. Give me all the fame

Try it again

[Verse Two]
I been striving for the lights. Boy, I told ya
For women? Nah. Money? Eh. To change pop culture
I spit sick like I made out with a vulture
Whose buffet was a highway in the desert in Arizona
They say who you taking with when you rise? I say everybody that deserves to go
That's a very small few but they paying they dues. So have these fools and fronting niggas won't know
And with a flow like that he should be on the map. No, he should be the map. No, he should be the globe
Angle your fitted. Huh? Tip your hat. And tell em where my music at. Give me downloads
And as far as talent goes I couldn't do anymore
Murdered Bru's beat. Sent some flowers to his door

[Hook]

Give it all to me. Yeah
I wanna be in HD (Laughs)

[Hook]

Uh. This a good way to start things off right?
