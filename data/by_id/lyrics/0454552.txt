Ain't no joke
I don't care y'all spics are also broke
All you have is fucking dope
Y'all just get high
Uses niggas WiFi
Think yall fly
Got bitched out, yo ty
They really try
And really lie
Yo Victor say goodbye
You bout to cry
Then bout to die
Don't even know what's the math pie
Niggas don't really ride
Y'all can't get a bride
Can't have shit a side
Hope y'all stay alive
Wanna have y'all dead fried
Y'all ain't have no lines
Also no rhymes
Surprised y'all make crime
Be the worst when its ur prime
Y'all dirty lemon and lime
Y your name is Victor
Ain't never winner, not a hitter
Fuck your feelings get bitter
Y'all not bigger
Not even pulling triggers
So broke can't get a gold digger
I know whats riding a action figure
Y'all big as the tip of my fingerYou might also like
