I heard you got robbed last week
Did you know I got shot last night?
It's like dependency on a game called hearsay
You hear it said but did you hear it right?

[Verse 2]
So I was walking the bricks in my front yard
They're uneven and cracking with age
I made an attempt to arrange them perfectly
But when I got done they wouldn't fit into place

[Chorus]
And I can't say when I plan on giving up
I'm trying to think, don't know when it'll end
I can't say when I plan on giving up
I'm trying to think, don't know when it'll end

[Verse 3]
I heard a rumor you went on a trip
Did you know I just got back?
I had a chance to think while I was away
I pointed fingers of blame 'til they were pointing at me

[Verse 4]
So I rode my temper until I heard the water
But I hit a fence that was chained and barred
I looked and tried to find another way in
That's when I finally realized that I'd been trying too hard
You might also like[Chorus]
I can't say when I plan on giving up
I'm trying to think, don't know when it'll end
I can't say when I plan on giving up
I'm trying to think, don't know when it'll end

[Chorus]
I can't say when I plan on giving up
I'm trying to think, don't know when it'll end
I can't say when I plan on giving up
I'm trying to think, don't know when it'll end
