You. Just. Give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

I'm talking to myself like I used to do
The touch of someone else
Always gets to you
Then something in you eyes
Baby, I can tell it too
Ooh you're just a stranger in the room

Better know what to say
Gotta know what to do
I can't feel a thing with you
Baby I can't feel a thing
Can't feel the same I used to do
Given a lie, never been true
But I get stronger everyday
While you're

Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day
You might also likeReckless with your love
You. Just. Give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day

Living in a void as in ecstasy
Building up a wealth of animosity
Always in disguise
There's nothing left but you
Ooh you're just a stranger in the room

Better know what to say
Gotta know what to do
I can't feel a thing with you
Baby I can't feel a thing
Can't feel the same I used to do
Given a lie, never been true
But I get stronger everyday
While you're

Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it up
Fearless with your life
But no-one can you trust
Reckless with your love
You. Just. Give it away
Fearless with your life
Living day to day
