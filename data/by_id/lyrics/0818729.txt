Stab! smash! crush the weak!
No shelter for believers
No shadows to cover

The legions from beneath
Walk over the weak ones!
Breathe the fresh air
For the last time

Who is your god?
What is god anyway?
So you still believe?
This tour is for you!

The legions from beneath
Smash the weak ones!
Breathe the rotten air
Your lungs burn in hell!

Minds revealed
No secrets left
Everyone punished
Is this your end
(this is a day for blasphemy)

Walk over the weak ones!
No shelter for believers
No shadows to cover

Your beliefs crushed!
Beaten away! fed to the worms!

Minds revealed
No secrets left
Everyone punished
Is this your end
(welcome to a day of blasphemy)
