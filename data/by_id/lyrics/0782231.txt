Lonely crow, dark green dream
I got no paddle and I got no shoes
I'm solo in a rawhide canoe

Hundreds of them little bug eyes
Them drooly runny glassy eyes
Smilin' through the foggy soup
I crack a grin and laugh in tune

And I would love to float...on...munky river
I would love to float...on...

(yeah, I would)

Hoo!

Sad lip hang out on a limb
Purple paw pluckin a guitar
All string broke except for two
Careful chimp, CARESS THE BASS

Waters' only shallow deep
Munkies dip into the river
Black and blue moon light up the leaves
Cypress branches chuckle and shiver

Woo!

Yeah! (Float on, c'mon, c'mon!)

(Yeah boy!)

And on the last soft oxbow
Munkies wave goodbye (good bye)
I patch my boat with chewin' gum
This purple haze is easy on my...
