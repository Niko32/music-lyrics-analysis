You left your door wide open
Couldn't help but walk in
It's the last place I should be
But I'm dying to see you

[Pre-Chorus]
Have I held out for something
That is never gonna happen?

[Chorus]
It's not me that you love
It's not me that you love
It's not me that you love
It's not me that you love
It's not me that you love
It's not me that you love

[Verse 2]
You woke up cold this morning
Shied away from my touch
I would never mean to hurt you
'Cause I love you so much

[Pre-Chorus]
Was it always only one night
That you ever wanted from me?
You might also like[Chorus]
It's not me that you love
It's not me that you love
It's not me that you love
It's not me that you love
It's not me that you love
It's not me that you love
