They've tried to lock us at the mainstream door
Even Elvis had to tone it down
They kept the wildest cats all underground

Chorus:
Wherever we go they put us down
On every street, in every down
We got the magic, we got the style
It's the rockin' cats that drive 'em wild
Well, when a good band comes along
They try to change the way they play their song
They turn around and steal our riffs
Turn on the TV, see a boy band with quiffs

Chorus:
Wherever we go they put us down
On every street, in every town
We got the magic, we got the style
It's the rockin' cats that drive 'em wild

(Repeat Chorus x2)You might also like
