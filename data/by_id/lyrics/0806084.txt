Gunshot by the side of the road - highway scenery
Revolution got no goals, except keepin' the family together
Dang chains isn't sweet on you
Freedom fighter, don't let 'em get you alive
You won't change a damn thing that is true
Freedom fighter, keep your head on tonight
Take me on with you
Take me along with you tonight
She came late for the tank parade with her emancipation song
She plugged in a guitar and played, and sang of Spanish bombs
Jackknifed inside and prayed, the world has come undone!
Yeah, whatever...
Damn chains look good on you
Chorus
Sagittarius rising low, may he follow you
Shine on you and take you home, over the eastern seaYou might also like
