For a place you've never been?
Well, here it is
Here it is

And you've been down there on the bottom
And looking out for friends
Here I am
Here I am

We've both grown tired
Of running after rainbows
Here we are
Darling, here we are

When it feels like you've been drifting
And you don't know where you've been
Come on in
You can come on in

And if all you've seen are backdoors
That lead you out of town
Turn around
You can turn around

We've both grown tired
Of running after rainbows
Here we are
Darling, here we are
You might also likeWe've both grown tired
Of running from each other
Here we are
Darling, here we are

Here we are
Here we are
