Deep down they feeling me like porn star taking monster d

Defense, that’s how you win a ball game with spalding

Hot dang my rec coach told me the same thing

Coaches always talk shit its falling off their upper lip

Tossin that salad you’re expired I’m valid

Access granted, put me in, I demand it

(Free pass) Lead me where they’re handin them out

Outer space, the great outdoors catch me after my chores

Gotta catch em all where are yours, im talking bout pokemon

Dancing on the edge sifting through the hedge

Searching for a Pikachu, come on let me peek at you

Love a sneak preview, ooh… sign me up, for season 2

Like hard core porn science fiction

Im talking to a fembot, do you think she thing im hot

Probably my body temp like 83 degrees, 83 degrees, 83 degrees

Never claim to be better, proclaimed to be great

Can't compare us like bannanas and grapes

You’re teeny tiny purple, if you step on me its hurtful

Take trip to the earth, emerge mouth dirt filled

The flavors artificial, but the cherry taste so real

Im a crimial

My message is subliminal

More so reverse psychology

I scream so you'll acknowledge me
Like prodies, practicing alchemy

If i was full alchemist

I’d probably sell half the shit

Only buy happiness

Bag it, sell it for double

Find you on my block that’s trouble

Listen, til you hip to it, my tunes that is

Laugh and encourage him he's still a rookie

Its hard to be a winner, winner winner chicken dinner

Yet there’s nothing harder than being a beginner

Front row of church sitting next to some sinners

I don’t care if you’re catholic

You’re brain is still prejudice
God said love em all, so I’m trying real hard

But im patient and waitin I ain't even started datin
