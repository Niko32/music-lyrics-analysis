Ah, waaaaaan
Waan, ah

[Verse 1: Xavier Wulf]
A lot of these fools want to put harm up on me
Little do they know, I got that vicious blade on me
760 for the dick, 4 in the mornin'
Cannonballs flyin' but I swear they ain't goin' to harm me
Blood shore, frozen black door if you want me
That's where I'll be, cuttin' heads when I'm lonely
Fuck a damn law, I break 'em all, now they want me
I'ma eat good while my enemy is hungry
Bitch, I'm in some ice, holding mountains while it's stormin'
Even Captain Kuchiki told me that they couldn't hold me
All these niggas slow like a sloth, I be runnin'
I'm so far ahead, I don't even see 'em comin'
Roll it up and light it, hit the mall, fuck the munchies
I'ma beat your ass if you don't got my money
I don't do no I-owe-you's, so bitch, come up with somethin'
And if you don't, I will be leavin' with your blood, bitch
A lot of these fools want to put harm up on me

Blood shore, frozen black door if you want me
That's where I'll be, cuttin' heads when I'm lonely
Fuck a damn law, I break 'em all, now they want me
I'ma eat good while my enemy is starvin'
A lot of these fools want to put harm up on me
Little do they know, I got that vicious blade on me
760 for the dick, 4 in the mornin'
Cannonballs flyin' but I swear they ain't goin' to harm me

All these niggas slow like a sloth, I be runnin'
I'm so far ahead, I don't even see 'em comin'
Roll it up and smoke it, hit the mall, fuck the munchies
I'ma beat your ass if you don't got my money
