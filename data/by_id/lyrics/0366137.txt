Surprised to be alive, not the only one
Said the way you're living is a damn shame
Need someone to carry on the family name
Remember boy, you know your mama's only son

[Verse]
Break the chains, set a nigga free
Let me off parole let a nigga be
Cops on patrol, I guess they patrolling for me
They want my soul, but I don't never keep it on me
It's in a place that most are forbidden
But anyplace is cool that's far away from prison
Alice In Chains and my heart is too
If your heart's in the same place, mine goes out to you
And when the clock strikes two, tell you what I'm gonna do
When it hits three, you know where I'm gonna be
When it hits four, you know I'm out the door
When it hits five I pray to God I'm still alive
Even though I'm going all out, yea I'm ready to die
Pullin pistols in the church in the omens of my enemies eyes
Get the sticks buck 'em
Fuck 'em, if there's nothing left then freedom then nothing
It's nothing

[Hook]
Surprised to be alive, not the only one
Said the way you're living is a damn shame
Need someone to carry on the family name
Remember boy, you know your mama's only son

You know, the war on drugs is not a real war on drugs
The war on drugs is a real war on thugs
It's a war on my brothers that's trying to make a dollar
A war on niggas with nice things trying to make a collar
Cause when they make collars, rich people make profit
Drug money going straight into the devil's pocket
Put your ass in a cage, fuckin lock it
Cops ride by every thirty minutes to watch us
With intentions to stop us
For trying to feed our families
Hollar if you hear me, just nod if you understand me
It's a lot of shit in this world I don't understand
It's a lot of shit in this world that I don't understand
A lot of shit in this world that I don't understand
That goes against the true brotherhood of man
That goes against the true brotherhood of man
