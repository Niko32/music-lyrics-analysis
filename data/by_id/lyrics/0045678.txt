"The incredible..." "DJ"
"The tables turn"
"Reel it back one time"
"OK, Tony Touch"
"...is so tremendous"
"Tony Touch"

[Verse 1: Guru]
Yo, I be the mic smoker
Puff dro with Tony Toca
He be the beat maker
The master piece maker
Makin' masterpieces, timeless works of art
Some of y'all might be afraid of what lurks in the dark
So by the wave of his hand and by the flick of his wrist
Tone brings things to light at the flip of a switch
Well respected, well connected From Bushwick to Vegas
B-Boy fanatic, dramatic on the cross faders
All my people that love that real shit
They got love for Tone 'cause he make em feel shit
Other DJs like to steal shit
But when we see 'em, they be frontin' like it's love
Knowin' damn well they want to be him
Taino Indian style, that's who be givin' him style
It be the piece maker, I'm the jewel of the wild
Gang to the Starr, hold ya Glock steady
Word to Rock Steady, betta get ya blocks ready

[Verse 2: Guru]
Who sleepin' on the pro, creepin' on the low?
T-O-N to the Y, fuck with us and watch your fam die
Damn I, know you want another CD of that
Hardcore rap shit, we got a degree in that
I majored in lacin' fiends, chasin' green, stayin' clean
Knowin' what it's like to be strugglin' and creating dreams
Poof, something arises, outta nothing
And surprises all you all you weak minded, sideways suckas
You can't deny it, it's like doing a bid and not learning jack shit
Heard my old Tony Touch tape and ask me, "What was that shit?"
Niggas got shit backwards, it's drastic
Will the dollar rule or will we rely on plastic?
No wack shit, we're gonna rely on the vinyl
Final decisions and mad revisions for all rivals
I will, always be the brother you can relate ta
Guru, Premier, and my man Tone the Piece Maker
