I dreamt a million things to say
I dreamt a million ways to die

[Verse 1: xsMph]
Laid down had a dream
Woke up with a million greens
A million fucking thoughts running through my brain
Fuck insanity
I rather live life in my mother fucking fantasy
My X360, bunch of socks 
And just my hand and me
My bi-polar syndrome never triggers no more panickingÃÂ 
But This lonely atmosphere kinda throws off this ecstasy
But it's all koo
Cause I'm just waiting for you
With my Hard rock cock baby
Now what you gonna do?
Let me whisper in your ear and tell you how I feel
When your eyes closed in your glass I slipped a couple pills
And now your feeling insecure and wanna stay the night
Well that's alright, let me make some room next to my bike
Green dreams, A.D.H.D no more
Red eyes, triple X type of homemade porn
Hazy vision, used needlesÃÂÃÂ Where I'm the object of scorn
Like I died physically and was mentally reborn
I dreamt of a million fucking things

[Verse 2]
Now when the world is mad at me
I ÃÂÃÂ lay down and have a dream
I walk with my head high
Smoke a sweet cause I'm the kingAnd I'm tryna stay focusÃÂÃÂ 
But this lotus is making my vision bogus
My mind is up and down, a rollercoaster
I'm tryna get closer to the feeling above aroused
But it only happens when your around
Unfortunately your on the other side of this fucking town
Try to reminisce all the small things you do
Calling you up tryna get you to come on through
But every time you answer I hear the same excuse
And a goodbye I love you, I could probably see you soonSo I rather be by myself, sleep in tonightA rope around my head on the other end a kite
Until I desperately shrivel up and cum in delight
And who said a one man show ain't top flightClouds disappear sun rise above my head
Gashed wrist fuck I had a nightmare again
I think these drugs got me tripping
I keep dreaming of you
