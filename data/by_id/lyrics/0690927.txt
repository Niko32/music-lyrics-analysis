I hope you understand I'm hanging on to you
Through our colors of love
I will never fade out or stray too far from you
I'll be the face in every moon
Painting a smile along reminding you
Every panic tear infused
We will survive

[Chorus]
But how do we keep our love alive?
Why does something so good feels so damn hard tonight?
When its nobody's fault then we'll tire to try
I'm gonna keep our love alive
I'm gonna keep our love alive

[Verse 2]
I know you understand how you surrender me
From the city of ruins
I was built back up when your heart cemented me
I'll be the silence where you sleep
I'll be the violence to you on the streets
You can look up and follow me
Through the dead of the night

[Chorus]
But how do we keep our love alive?
Why does something so good feels so damn hard tonight?
When its nobody's fault then we'll tire to try
I'm gonna keep our love alive
I'm gonna keep our love alive
You might also like[Chorus]
How do we keep our love alive?
Why does something so good feels so damn hard tonight?
When its nobody's fault then we'll tire to try
I'm gonna keep our love alive, alive, alive...
I'm gonna keep our love alive

I'm gonna keep our love alive
