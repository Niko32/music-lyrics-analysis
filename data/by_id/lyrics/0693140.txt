This is panic, setting in

I am waiting on a war
This is panic, setting in

From what it seems
All could use some cleansing
Better hurry up since we're not pretending
And panic wouldn't mean so much
If there was such a thing as end in sight

But I know it's only coming in waves, to seal our silence

We're waiting on a war, coming through this weather
All aboard (All aboard)

We're waiting on a war, coming through this weather
All aboard (Into the storm)

With all of this brings death of descending
Belief with the sun comes never ending
As long as there is life in heart, there will be a thing as endless fight

But I know it's only coming in waves, to steal our silence
You might also likeWe're waiting on a war, coming through this weather
All aboard
We're waiting on a war, coming through this weather
All aboard

It's only here I find myself where karma looms a long way down
And a long way out, come lock us in...
While we're waiting
Seems like a lifetime
But while we're waiting, all aboard

We're waiting on a war, coming through this weather
All aboard
Horizons from the shore, too many bloody hands
Take back your life

We're waiting on a war, coming through this weather
All aboard, into the storm
