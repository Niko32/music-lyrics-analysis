Four o'clock in the morning and another heart breaks

Remembering the good times that we have been through

And I'm pleading guilty of loving you

And If We Don't Belong Together

Then where do we belong

I never felt so sure of myself never felt so strong

If anybody's asking there's not much to say

If anybody's asking I'm just turning away

And I'm not good at forgetting and I always find

Living without you is just running blind

And If We Don't Belong Together

Then where do we belong
You might also likeI never felt so sure of myself never felt so strong

And If We Don't Belong Together

Something must be wrong

If We Don't Belong Together

Then where do we belong
