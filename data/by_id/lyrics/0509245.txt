I'm in the same spot
And my pocket's got all the same rocks
That I got in the same squat
Same scotch pot, all in the same shop
Yeah, and will I ever move?
And I know it'd be clever to
So just put on your school shoes
Go out and get leathered in a Wetherspoons
But with a pay packet this weak
For the week, I know mate, it's peak
Do I get wrecked up for the night
Or keep it and eat for a week?
And you need to keep on guard
What's occurring is deep
A mate sold his stuff to buy crack
To smoke on his own while you sleep

Cause we're 20something
(We're somewhere inbetween)
We're 20something
(Where we're going, we're not sure)
We're 20something
(We keep making the same mistakes)
We're 20something
(But got time to make some more)

Are we worthless mugs?
Fussed about buying new shirts and drugs
Smug, strip clubs and chugs
Buy you a tequila, swap for a tug
It's that vanity song
That asks where my sanity's gone
And I'm pissed that the only cheque that I seem to get
Is a fucking reality one
I feel useless and shit
It's as ruthless as this
Yeah, I'm a 20something in a caff with my fry-up
Mopping up my bean juice with my chips
And now, I've got pages filled
We just try to go and pay the bills
Pubs, girls, raves and pills
Jaded thrills

[Verse 3: Context]
And I see some lads my age
Earning double what they pay me
But the only double I get
Is the one that ends in JD
And yeah, I'm all alone at night
Thinking it's changed from playing Golden Eye
Now all we do is go phone a guy
To get stuff to take through our nose or eye
Then I record it for your Bose with mics
Way I've spoken loud
Spout gas from my lungs
And when I'm gurning is the only time I bite my tongue
I'm out there, being lager-fueled
Use drinks till the strings on your heart are pulled
These are tales of lads
Who fear ending up unremarkable
[Hook]
