Can't you take this out of me?
All I want is to be near you
Oh my god how can I love thee?
All that I need is to be loved
Can't you take this out of me?
All I want is to be near you
Oh my god how can I love thee?

[Ad lib]
Oh my god
Oh my god

No one on earth can need what I need
No one on earth can feel what I must feel

All that I need
All that I need
All that I need
