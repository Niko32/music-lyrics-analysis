GO!

A boy like me is told he is both nine and ninety
And a boy like me should shut those books join the army
And a boy like me would never be seen fighting for peace
I want total chaos and a holiday home in the east

And a boy like me should know much better
Than to raise his flag in stormy weather
But I just can't get enough electric shocks
I want to buy a lighthouse, and ride a giraffe on the rocks

Na na na nana nanana na na na nana na. (x2). (I don't give up, x2)

Two dogs, two cats, a big kitchen and a welcome mat
(I want) two dogs, two cats, a big kitchen and a welcome mat
(I want) two dogs, two cats, a big kitchen and a welcome mat

I want all this, and all I shall have. (All you shall have)
(No, I don't give up)
A boy like me don't ever give up, give up his dream
No
A boy like me don't ever give up, give up his dream
No
A boy like me, don't ever give up, give up his dream
No
A boy like me, don't ever give up, give up his dream
