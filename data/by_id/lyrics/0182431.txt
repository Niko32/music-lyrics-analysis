Likes,you ain't gotta like me simplicity,you ain't got it like me,yall dont know the half
Im coming for the whole meal,brass appeal
Silly rapper dont be so quick the grab a deal
Level headed,real art they cherish
They dont get it they ain't fucking with it
Whatever tell em to suck a dick
Nigga hate me like lebron,hate me more when I get a ring
Everybody trying to be a king
I sing a song for you late bloomers
Hiphop got a brain tumor,I blame it on the consumer
Let me explain,how ill never explain that
Just give them bass and some simple raps
Dont wanna hear ya suggestions,get fuck out my session
All they ever do is throw a label at you but this rap shit a form of expression
Before I wrote I was tryna decide the hook
Fuck a hook,fuck comparisons,they ain't really hearing him look
I hope they really listen up,dishonest cowards get the fuck from round us
Get the fuck from round me cuz you dont even know the half
My man you dont know the half
Lord forgive me im a sinner my excuses understandable
THESE RAP GENIUS DECODES DONT HELP THEM UNDERSTAND HIM THOUGH

I use to wanna be Jordan,til I was introduced to recording
Reporting live from rock bottom,paranoia as I light up
Me myself and I trading thoughts in a cipher
You try to decipher,they judging me wrong
Pardon me for being anti they rubbing me wrong
And i'll never get how these niggas lying over stupid shit
Insult yo dignity ,that popularity is the enemy
Ain't trying to be the realest i'll leave that you
Im just trying to be everything they didn't expect me to
Selling myself short,be everything and more you gon respect me to
Its a full time job not to lose my cool
Before I wrote I was tryna decide the hook
Fuck a hook,fuck comparisons,they ain't really hearing him look
I hope they really listen up,dishonest cowards get the fuck from round us
Get the fuck from round me cuz bitch you dont know the half
Dont mean to call you a bitch but you dont know the half
You might also likeNow they faces sour,all that love is sour
Fuck love,left my ex I can do without her
In the mist of it all I realized my power
Now im a use it I dedicate this to you doubters
I dedicate this to my dedication
I promise to be me and not a imitation
Lost self control
Light a match set a fire I won't burn I turn to gold
Always one for asking questions knowledge I look to gain
But I acknowledge that im stubborn but yall dont know a thing
