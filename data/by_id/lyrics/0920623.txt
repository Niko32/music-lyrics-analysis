Here's some songs I got together last week
Uh, I don't know the title of the first one
Maybe uh, "Rivers of the Blood"

[Verse 1]
Have you seen the rivers of the blood?
First a trickle, then a flood
First the ocean's pounding roar
Then a tidal wave hits upon the shore
Knives and arrows fell like rain
And the powder burst aflame
And the flames they flew so high
Dropped their poison down from the sky

[Chorus]
In the shadow of the bygone days
Millions died in a million ways
Now the whining of the missile's call
It's time to rise or it's time to fall
For now one million bombs are stored
But they keep building more and more
Can't you hear the warning sound?
Don't you know there's still time to turn around?

[Chorus]
In the shadow of the bygone days
Millions died in a million ways
Now the whining of the missile's call
It's time to rise or it's time to fall
For now one million bombs are stored
They keep building more and more
Can't you you hear the warning sound?
Don't you know there's still time to turn around?
Don't you know there's still time to turn around?
