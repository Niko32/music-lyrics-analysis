And your chicken wings
Throw it in your deep fryer
Burning chili set your heart on fire

Think you've got real soul
Eating chickens by the whole
And make a stop at your liquor store
And go pick yourself up a couple of 40's

Your brother, your mother, your father, your sister
Your cousins, your daughter, Your brother your father
And your house pets

Now the grill be hot (Hot as balls)
So throw the flesh down (s-s-s-s-s)
Beans and cheese and pork fritter
Tomorrow you'll be sufferin on the shitterYou might also like
