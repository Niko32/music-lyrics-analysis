It's 2am and she hasn't been textin'
You call just to check in, but you already know where she's sleepin'
Her mouth is busy, while the phone is ringing
She can't take your call right now and you know the reason
I turn the ringer off and fuck her to The Weeknd
These long, Wicked Games always leave her leakin'
Lay down babygirl I know what you're seekin'
The Party & The After Party playing while we freakin'
Don't wake me up in The Morning, you know I like to sleep in
Make me breakfast and close the door behind you
Don't text me until I text you
And don't worry about you know who
Tell him you had to work late, it's kinda true
I'll call you in a couple nights, I know you wanna come thru
Can't control my love and neither can you
Girl you wanna tell him, but I think he already knew
Lay back in the shower baby, imma clean you out. Shampoo
Can't go back to him, my love is what you're used to
Couldn't stand that life again, My life is what you'll stick to
You say you love Mace, and he'll just have to make do
Back to my place, another round, no Kung fu
Babygirl I don't know what I'd do without you
Im so glad you're here with me and that this is what it's come too
Then on to girl number two
The one I've had a crush on since one-two
We only just started talking, but I'm already hooked
I want to be totally committed, but it'd be a lie to say that I haven't looked
At other girls, but it's you I wanna be with
All these conflicts keep appearing, cancellations almost to the fifth
Don't be unsure babygirl, I'm whatchu need
Let's just have lunch together and then we can proceed
To holding hands, maybe even dating
But just to kiss you and hold you in my arms I don't mind waiting
Don't listen to those other hoes they're just hating
We'll go far girl, our commitment never abating
I imagine our dates, watch Netflix and then go skating
I wanna show you off girl, you're something special
I'll take your love and put it on a pedestal
If you're not happy. I'll never settle
I'll be sensual, respectable, exceptional, dependable, never questionable
Damn this beat and my flow impeccable
Takes my raps to the 3000th dimension
Gimme a chance girl, our love could be so close to perfectionYou might also like
