Chagal ki na khai?
Kuch bolo ke ni?

Is there nothing that a madman won't say?
Is there nothing that a goat won't eat?...
Common sense -
Misinformation received
By the common man
You've been just as deceived
An effect that was planned by the powers that be
A most effective tool for division and rule
A most effective tool for division and rule

And people of different cultural persuasions
Start to develop hindered relations
So what can be done to dissipate the friction?
Gotta separate the facts, yes the facts from the fiction

"Ah, I, I don't know .....
Ah, I, I don't know .....
Ah, I, I don't know .....

But once they get get here
There is no knowing what they'll get up to!"
You might also likeAll this talk about housing
Just a method of arousing bad feeling
Appealing to people's prejudice
And then they redirect
Their lack of self respect
Towards a visible target
A visible target

You seem to have forgotten
That the apple has always been rotten
And that black people are not the cause of your problems

Black people are not the cause of your problems
We're often told that this country's bursting at the seams
We're never told that there are in fact more people leaving than entering
Immigration has become synonymous with black people
Yet over sixty per cent of immigrants are white .....

"Things were good in the good olden days" they say
"Jobs in the factories" (economic slaves!)
"We kept our doors open right throughout the day"
(But the poverty was such That there was nothing to nick anyway!)

Black people constitute less than six per cent of the population

"Enough is enough."

"This country's going to the wogs!"

Oh, the Sun has got its facts wrong Hip, hip, hooray (?!)
The Sun has got its facts wrong and it's fucking up my day ...

A race war That's what they're fighting for
Rivers of blood is what they want
By claiming influx, a flood or a swamp -
There ain't no influx, a flood or a swamp!
