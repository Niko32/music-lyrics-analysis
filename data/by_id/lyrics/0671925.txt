I'll deck my brow with roses
The loved ones may be there
And gems that others give me
Will shine within my hair
And even those who know me
Will think my heart is light
Though my heart may break tomorrow
I'll be all smiles tonight

[Chorus]
I'll be all smiles tonight, love
I'll be all smiles tonight
Though my heart may break tomorrow
I'll be all smiles tonight

[Verse 2]
Oh, when the dance commences
Oh, how I will rejoice
I'll sing the song you taught me
Without a falling voice
When the flattering ones come around me
They'll think my heart is light
Though my heart may break tomorrow
I'll be all smiles tonight
You might also like[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
And when the room he enters
With a bride upon his arm
I stood and gazed upon him
As though he was a charm
And onced he smiled upon her
And onced he smiled on me
They know not what I suffered
They found no change in me

[Chorus]
