And why we do the things we do
Too many questions without answers
(You'll lose)
Living life without lesson
(You'll lose)

When I'm sleeping next to you
And I have arms around you
When I have you in my heart
I feel so close to you

If my dreams were real
If my life was a story
If my dreams were real
I'd put my arms around you

If my dreams were real
I'D PUT MY ARMS AROUND YOU
I'D PUT MY ARMS AROUND YOU
I'D PUT MY ARMS...AROUND

Too many queation without answers
IT'S ALMOST BETTER
Living life without lesson
So blind to see that I lost you
No goodbyes
You might also likeJust left my side I'm without you now
I was all for you

If my life story you learn
From this my dream were real
I'd put my arms around you
I'd put my arms around you

I'D PUT MY ARMS AROUND YOU
I'D PUT MY ARMS
I'd put my arms around you
I'D PUT MY ARMS
I'd put my arms around you
I'D PUT MY ARMS
