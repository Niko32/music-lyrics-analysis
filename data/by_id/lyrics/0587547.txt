It was cute when I came out and started to speak
I was young and starting out just like a creek
I wasn't quite a river yet
But you could bet
I wouldn't have any fish swimming into my net
I can conquer no sweat
But my words are in check
But fish, man, they're followers like fans on my deck
And I'm not a follower
I don't have tattoos on my neck
And I'm not about to peck my head into your words
That's absurd
I'm sure
People out there will think
But I'm still new
I am private
No crew
And I will rise and rise
And I will not sink
In one blink
You'll say "Wow I didn't think"
Wow I will link my words to a hook
Like words in a book
L-Like words in a book
You might also like[Chorus]
My music
You follow and you lose it
I know you feel
My music
You follow and you lose it
I know you feel my music

[Verse 2]
I stand high on my heel
Run really fast with my wheels
I have Adidas and Nike
I'll run after a meal
Read my lyrics something called unique
Like my antique desk
Where I write my music like the rest
Even the best
But I don't know
If you want me for a show
I take ooVoo
Give me a call
That is all
If you like my music
When you party you better use it
But now the fuse is lit
Blast off like a damn rocket ship
When I get a starring roll energy builds
I flip
I'm happy but now I gotta be serious
So I look into music cause I'm curious
But my name is Zachh
It is not George
And I won't reach a gap
Or fall in a gorge
[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's bogus
Hocus pocus
Music that sucks man
Now I owe it
To the music fans that love music
It feels like I just wanna sue it
Just do it, Zachh
Just trying to make a living
Just like me
The music that I'm giving
Giving, giving, giving
Living, living

[Chorus] x2

[Outro]
Back to the Basics
My music
My music
