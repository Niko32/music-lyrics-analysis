C’mon over here and give me a kiss
I think I’ll take you dancin’ tonight
We’ll do some waltzin’ and some two-steppin’
And say a fond farewell to our close friends
Because darlin’ just like we dreamed
We’ve got a ranch to run
Sugarpie, check out that sky
Look how it stretches out for miles
Our place is just up around the double bend
Won’t you check out that big oak tree
Ain’t that a perfect branch to hang a swing
Couple youngsters runnin’ around
Be one hell of a thing
Ain’t she good, good lookin’ country
She sure look good, good, good, good on you
Kiss me quick, you pretty little fox
You’re everything that a man could want
And you’re good, good, good lookin’ too
Honeybear, hold it right there
The sun’s caught hold of your golden hair
And there’s a nice soft spot to put my knee
Well, you’re as fine as flowers
I could just stare at you for hours
And I was wonderin’ if you’d wanna marry me
Ain’t she good, good lookin’ country
She sure looks good good good, good on you
Kiss me quick, you pretty little fox
You’re everything that a man could want
And you’re good, good, good looking too
[Musical Interlude]
Girls come kiss your daddy
He jus fixed up an old Caddy
And if you’re good he’s gonna take you for a ride
Go tell your mama, “Come quick,”
We’re all going out chasin’ sunsets
You know it’s all right
It’s all right by me
Ain’t she good, good lookin’ country
She sure looks good good good, good on you
Kiss me quick, you pretty little fox
You’re everything that a man could want
And you’re good, good, good looking too
Ain’t she good, good lookin’ country
She sure looks good good good, good on you
Kiss me quick, you pretty little fox
You’re everything that a man could want
And you’re good, good, good looking tooYou might also like
