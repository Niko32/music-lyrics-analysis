Oh, I know you're still with me
You're my compass and my sea
And I know you're still with me
You're my compass and my sea

[Verse 2]
Oh, I hope you can hear me
All those million miles away, you'd stay
'Cause I'd love you dearly
All those billion miles away

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thing I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thing I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thing I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're my only friend in need

[Verse 3]
Green broken glass ocean
You break me, slow motion (Oh, oh)
No map and no message
It's the deepest green I know (Oh, oh)
But I know you're still with me
You're my compass and my sea (Oh, oh)
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thing I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thing I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thing I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're my only friend in need

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thing I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're my only friend in need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thing I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're my only friend in need

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thing I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thing I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're the only thing I need
'Cause I've been around two times
And found that you're my only friend in need
