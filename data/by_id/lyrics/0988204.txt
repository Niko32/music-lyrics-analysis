We've got more than we could ever see
But to keep it is harder than anything else
I love ya, let me tell ya. We could go on and never miss
That's why I say, I've got enough heartaches. Tell me what you see when you look at me, yeah
We've got a good thing, let's not lose it
Is it right? Is it wrong when you say it won't be long
I've got enough, I've got enough heartaches

Sitting here wanting you by my side. Should I run away? No, I'm afraid to hide

Lonely, like a cross on the other side of the street. I'm mixed up, not messed up
Strong in a field of wheat. That's why I say, I've got enough heartaches. Tell me what you see when you look at me, yeah
We've got a good thing, let's not lose it
