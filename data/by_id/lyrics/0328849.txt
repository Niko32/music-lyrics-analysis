Our policy is to immediately deactivate any Uber partner involved in a serious law enforcement matter.  For that reason, we urge the police to release information about the driver in question as soon as possible.  If the driver is a partner of Uber, his or her Uber account will immediately be deactivated.

UPDATE: We thank law enforcement for the quick release of information. We can confirm that the driver in question was a partner of Uber and that we have deactivated his Uber account.  The driver was not providing services on the Uber system during the time of the accident. We again extend our deepest condolences to the family and victims of this tragic accident.
