[Verse 1]
Presence, elegance, an unmistakable dominance
Behind those steely eyes
Anything you know is coincidence
No one seems to know anything about his age, just his name
He’s always dressed for fame
Ooh, the Kaiser is the maestro

[Chorus]
Let a girl dream a bit
To wear a garment so delish
I’d be out of my mind
The slightest designs, the ultimate can't miss
You're the new ingénue
A gift he can’t buy from you
But if I had to pay I’d sure find a way to break the bank
I’d break the bank that day

[Verse 2]
Ladies, his designs make the words fall out of a pantomime
Colors, how they flow
Go from avant-garde to beyond sublime
History and mystery, he stops the hands of time
The magic's in his mind
‘Cause the Kaiser is the maestro
You might also like[Chorus]
Let a girl dream a bit
To wear a garment so delish
I’d be out of my mind
The slightest designs, the ultimate can't miss
You're the new ingénue
A gift he can’t buy from you
But if I had to pay I’d sure find a way to break the bank
I’d break the bank that day
Ooh, he is a maestro
He is a maestro (Maestro!)
Maestro, maestro

[Spoken end]
You must never think that you saw it all. You have always the eyes open, you have to be like a roof with lots of antennas, get all the images. And, you don’t say ‘I don’t like this because it was better before, this is not chic, this is not elegant.’ You know, every period has the taste it deserves. Vulgar, not vulgar, we don’t know, it’s not up to us to be the judge of times
