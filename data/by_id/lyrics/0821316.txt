Can’t find the divide
Maybe the ocean is a ghost
Living in the horizon

And my heart beats fast
As I count the miles
From the city line
No, I’m not running
I’m just stealing time

If I don’t go
How will I ever know
What’s on the other side?
I can’t tell the wheel from the road
Or the sea from the sky

I gotta find, I gotta find
Find the divide

I drove a lonely distance
Till the road turned to fire
The night’s moving in around me
But I’m not tired

Yeah, my heart beats fast
Shadows win the fight against the east, oh
The lines are blurring now
And I can’t tell the lion from the beast
You might also likeIf I don’t go
How will I ever know
What’s on the other side?
I can’t tell the wheel from the road
Or the sea from the sky

I gotta find, I gotta find
Find the divide
