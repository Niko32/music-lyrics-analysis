Oh, man
This is nasty

[Verse 1]
Keep me out of this uniform
I don't know what I'm wearing it for
Coiled like a spring I'm ready to explode
Yeah I'm an animal that can't be controlled
Just hear me out or set me off

[Verse 2]
Keep me out of this uniform
I don't know what I'm wearing it for
Coiled like a spring I'm ready to explode
Yeah I'm an animal that can't be controlled
Just hear me out or set me off

[Chorus 1]
So, how does it feel
To reveal what you already know?
Fire in your eyes, standing on your own
No one ever wants to be alone

[Verse 2]
I see you there no hair out of place
I see that fucking look on your face
I'll wipe it off of you one of these days
Counting the hours to my escape
So hear me out or set me off
You might also like[Chorus 2]
So how does it feel
To reveal what you already know?
Just because it’s me, you could never see
Someday it will come to you

[Bridge]
So, how does it feel
To reveal what you already know?

[Outro]
Fire in your eyes, standing on your own
No one ever wants to be alone
So how does it feel
To reveal what you already know?
(I, I, I'm just an animal that can't be controlled)
Just because it’s me, you could never see
(I, I, I'm just an animal that can't be controlled, I, I)
Someday it will come to you
