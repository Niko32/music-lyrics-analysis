Should I tell you after all that we've been through
Should I tell you, even though you don't want me to
Should I tell you goodbye?
Should I?

Could you show me a way out of this misery?
Could you show me any way to set me free?
Should I tell you goodbye?
Should I?

You know it's been a long, long time
We've been together
Don't you know I'm only being
Cruel to be kind?
Don't think badly of me
It's for the best, don't you see?

Should I tell you after all that we've been through
Should I tell you, even though you don't want me to
Should I tell you goodbye?
Should I?
I don't wanna tell you goodbye
But should I?You might also like
