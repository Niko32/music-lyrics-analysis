You gotta help wake me up from my dreams
You gotta help wake me up from my dreams
You gotta help wake me up from my dreams
You gotta help wake me up from my dreams
The world tells me that I’m worth nothing
All I want is a place to become something
But I’m just living life off of nothing

[Verse 1]
Society’s down to earth building civilizations
While I lift castles in the sky
Though I treat my world absolute
I’m just deceiving myself into living a lie
Endlessly ingesting rainbows
Savoring the moment knowing later I’ll pay the price
I’m an addict who can’t help but want more
I’m soul dry this fantasy won’t suffice
Greeted by hugs and kisses from friendly phantoms
As I cross the bridge to Terabithia
Making the same mistakes as Marx
For there is no such thing as Utopia
No one understands me? I ain’t that abstract
Nobody cares so they treat me as fiction not fact
That’s why I stay away from the crowd
Like B.o.B and Trey I put my head up in the clouds
Reality I am nothing
In la la land I become something
I’m everything that I hoped to be
But it ain’t me I’m just someone that I've always dreamed
Save me from what? I’m living a dream
Don’t wake me up cause I found freedom
But ironically I’m locked inside my head
I’m in heaven within prison

[Verse 2]
Endless lives, I can’t die
But this life has a price
I'm a be whatever I wanna be
In exchange for my soul, my mind, and my reality
I need love, nothing more
Is that so much to ask for
Guess the world is too selfish to give that
But in my fantasy I got more than I ever had, I love it too much
I can’t give up this life
Even though this thing ain’t right
I don’t know what I’m going to do
I rather live false than live the truth
I feel like such a fool

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Yeah infinitely loop, I’m stuck in limbo
Inception dreams are slower than slow-mo
Hard to leave once you enter
There’s no living that can measure
I’m a dumb fish going for the bait
I do it even when I know it’s fake
Fulfilling my pleasure and my greed
Dark mirage, I shoot up like a fiend
Uh, tricked myself with delusions
Now I can’t stop seeing illusions
Fantasizing about my future
While real chances pass by in a blur
Been living meaningless and fake
Tryna correct my childhood mistake
So desperate I’ll do anything it takes
I've slept to long, I need to wake
[Verse 4]
I don’t wanna stay inside my head
Gotta wake up and get outta bed
I don’t wanna stay inside my head
Gotta wake up and get outta bed
Trying, to escape, this eternal, nightmare
Losing, control, I need help, please save me
Trying, to escape, this eternal, nightmare
Losing, control, I need help, please save me

[Hook]
