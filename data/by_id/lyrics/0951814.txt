Is coming home
I guess I've been too long, girl
On this lonely road
Darlin', when I think about you
I feel half whole
That's the price of two bodies
Who are sharing one soul

No more absent hearts
No more lying here dreaming
'Cos I know that it won't be long
Until I make you feel
Just like I've never been gone
I can't wait to feel your warm body
Wrapped up in these arms
You know that I ... I've never needed you, baby
Like I'm needing you now
Soon we'll have all of the loving
That our heaven allows

We've been too long now
Apart and alone
We've poured too much of our love
Down this long distance phone
And it's gentle on the ear
So hard on the heart
That's the cost of two lovers
Who've been too long apart
No more absent hearts
No more lying here dreaming
'Cos I know that it won't be long
Until I make you feel
Just like I've never been gone
I can't wait to feel your warm body
Wrapped up in these arms
You know that I ... I've never needed you, baby
Like I'm needing you now
Soon we'll have all of the loving
That our heaven allows
You might also likeNo more holding back the feelings
No more being alone
'Cos I'm flying out tomorrow
I'm just calling to tell you: "Hold on, 'cos
It won't be long"
I can't wait to feel your warm body
Wrapped up in these arms
You know that I ... I've never needed you, baby
Just like I'm needing you now
Soon we'll have all of the loving
That .....
It won't be long
Can't wait to feel your warm body
Wrapped up in these arms
You know that I ... I've never needed you, baby
Just like I'm needing you now
Soon we'll have all of the loving
That our heaven allows
