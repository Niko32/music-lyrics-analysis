Cause we young and we ain't never gave a fuck (fuck)
So tonight we doing what the fuck we want (want)
Ain't no hatin', everybody showin' love (love)
This is what it's like when you up

[Verse 1]
Take me to your leader
You found him, you round him
Fishing for a shark and you gon' probably end up drowning
They crowning me a king but I'm a pharaoh
Catch arrows from a higher mind, fly with no apparel
They trynna' kill me, let 'em
When am I dying, never
Better get a grip 'fore I get a clip and pull it
Let a bullet, wait, I'm to clever
I got a different method to deal with all you pretenders
I'm ill with, shit so I spill it in a verse rather than a purse
Than I might offend them, bend them like I ain't got a referendum
Cause I don't, Oh am I fucking up your agenda?
Cause I won't ever stop, never not saying what I really want
They say they got your back but they really front
But me, I'm on point so I got me
Always getting better, never hitting top speed
Can't knock cause you can't clock, can't keep up with
You motherfuckers want it, I ain't nothing to fuck with

[verse 2]
But I don't see anybody in my way
Ain't another motherfucker in my lane
But I'm on another level, so I gotta get up outta here
I gotta make it happen anyway
I wish I could make it happen in a day
But I can't so I gotta get paid
But I can't so I gotta play the hand I got from the deal
Then I'mma be straight
To keep it real in a world so fake
To feel love when somebody feels hate
To feel lust when somebody feels trust
When somebody feels fuck then somebody feels great
Man this a weird world that we stay in
Hard time not to let the hate in
The fake motherfuckers wanna make friends
The real motherfuckers wanna kill motherfuckers for a meal
Can't chill cause they ain't fed
They trynna kill us all but we ain't dead
They trynna get us all if we ain't feds
Fuck cops and religions, man I hate pigs
Won't stop till I get up on top and the bullshit stop
Tryin' not to get got cause I know they don't play fair
Seems like life is a game here, or it's a line and you gotta wait here
Fuck that never give it up, give a fuck
Not me, trynna live it up
Get to trippin' on any beat and I'ma rip it up
Better listen to what I'm speaking, I'll rip you into pieces
If you go against me, you against yourself chill
You really wanna wreck your health, for real?
You better without that
Truth is that I'm probably better without rap, I doubt that
You can't last a second in my mind, cause time doesn't exist
A second of my time is slower than when you growing up stream of dreamers
What you make it and we living in a dream don't make it scene-ah
You ain't finna' pay for me, bet it's fake if it ain't for free
Go and hate on me, or cheer for we, or don't do shit either way it's still the same for me
Cause I'm on
[Hook]
