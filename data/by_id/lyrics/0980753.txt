That's left us so alone and broken
You'll never look back, never again
Spit the venom in their eyes and poison all the wells
This is the last embrace of everlasting hell

[Chorus:]
Disregarded Youth, everlasting hell
Depression's all... all they ever sell

Pain and Anger

An overwhelming darkness surrounds my life
Never seeing change, never seeing light
An explosion of pure anger
That comes in only hate
Is going off inside of me
And I wish it all on you

[Chorus]
