Once he's in, he gets so comfortable
Never wanting to commit for sure
Always lying 'bout the girl next door
That's how all these things begin
You let you guard down and he does you in
All your secrets he's been holding that in
To throw back at you when it benefits him
So he can go and play with all his chickens, oh

[Chorus]
Tell me where the lyin' and the front begun
(Tell me where the lyin' begun)
Why you playin' with me 'cause it's not fun
(Why you playin' with me?)
How can it be two if I'm your only one?
That's how crazy this game is (Crazy this game is)
Workin' so hard to complete ourselves
Never thinkin' 'bout the love that's on the shelf
(Never thinkin' 'bout me)
Livin' our life like there's no one else
That's how crazy this game is

[Verse 2]
Who you messin' with with all the games you play? (Games you play)
Oh, you didn't know, my name is Mary J
All the chicks you hit I heard they all look slayed
Tryna gas me saying things have changed
Now you're like the furthest thing from my brain
Never thought I had to say it to you this way
All these years I've been with you, boy, I feel so played
And now I need to go sharpen my blade
You might also like[Chorus]
Tell me where the lyin' and the front begun
(Tell me where the lyin' and the front)
Why you playin' with me 'cause it's not fun (It's not fun)
How can it be two if I'm your only one?
That's how crazy this game is
Workin' so hard to complete ourselves
Never thinkin' 'bout the love that's on the shelf
(Only thinkin' 'bout you, you, you)
Livin' our life like there's no one else
That's how crazy this game is

[Bridge]
This is one thing I will not tolerate
I'm not, for this, abusive, relation
Reclusive, excuses for our evolution (No)
When you play, with our (Play), love games (Oh), it starts (Oh)
Possessive (Oh), obsession (Oh), expression (Oh)

[Chorus]
Tell me where the lyin' and the front begun
(Tell me where the lying and the front)
Why you playin' with me 'cause it's not fun
(Why you playin' with me, boy?)
How can it be two if I'm your only one?
That's how crazy this game is
Workin' so hard to complete ourselves
(Working so hard to complete ourselves)
Never thinkin' 'bout the love that's on the shelf
(Never thinkin' 'bout it, no, never)
Livin' our life like there's no one else (No, no)
That's how crazy this game is
(That's how crazy this thing is)
Tell me where the lyin' and the front begun (Tell me)
Why you playin' with me 'cause it's not fun
(Where the lying and the front began)
How can it be two if I'm your only one?
That's how crazy this game is
[Outro]
That's how crazy this game is, yeah, yeah
Oh yes, how, that's how crazy this game is
