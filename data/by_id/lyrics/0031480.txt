[Verse 1: MF Grimm]
Don’t play
Board, play man, concentrate, hold head
Trust no one.  People flip, pimped by the feds
God’s chess game, premeditated sins, killing
You and all kin.  Play to win, man
Feds, hearsay, blindside, swoop me
Put away the luxuries, tints on a hooptie
Corrupt police extort—don’t pay, they wanna shot me
Proceed to execute me ‘cause

The vultures circle me
As the Sun burns my eyes (“Vultures swarm”)
The vultures circle me
Patiently they fly

[Verse 2: MF Grimm]
Someone will always wanna
Kill you, be you, see you, stalk you
Adore you, love you, hate you, leave you
Find you, flow with you, ride with you, say they feel you
Die for you, lie to you.  In your back they
Grab you, stab you, hurt you, mock you
Purse you, jerk you.  Momma told you, “Fool once
Shame them.  Twice, shame you, blame you”
So naïve, you let them demons game you (Damn), so
Watch out.  Vultures are falling, dizzy from circling
They sing with hunger, wings tired from working ‘em
Can’t castle, the king move while threatened, seek shelter
I’m hoping you’re not made it being a target in the open
Scars and memories won’t fade away, new wounds
More slayed, more paid price and lost life
So many before me in their tracks got stopped
They think I’m weak and they’re hoping that I drop ‘cause

[Hook: MF Grimm and (Sample with Scratches by DJ Crucial)]
The vultures circle me
As the Sun burns my eyes (“Vultures swarm”)
The vultures circle me
Patiently they fly (“Vultures swarm”)
The vultures circle me
And won’t let.  Now I know why (“Vultures swarm”)
The vultures circle me
Waiting for me to die (“Vultures swarm”)
