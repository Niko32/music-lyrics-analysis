I'm already convicted
My whole life has been turned around
I lost every job, I lost everything, every opportunity I can get
Can't get, buy cars, can't get rent, can't get none of that
But I'm still a survivor, y'know, I'm still coming to court
Still smiling, still signing autographs, but soon I'ma go crazy!
You know what I'm sayin? And it's up to the world, y'know
America eats its babies, we, I'm
No matter what y'all think about me
I'm still your child, you know what I'm sayin?
You can't just turn me off like that
Huh! Huh! Huh!

[Chorus: Rick Ross]
2Pac back, 2Pac back
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better picture me rollin’
Riding brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming "2Pac back, 2Pac back"
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Ugh! 2Pac back, I’m two Glocks strapped
Rolling down in Philly, this the new Iraq (Philly!)
Soon as I hit the the hood, they screaming, "Who got whacked?"
It’s a recession on the work, I’m screaming, "Who got crack?"
I’m sipping Hennessy!
Riding on my muh'fuckin' enemies!
Sliding in the back, I'm screaming, "MMG!" (Maybach Music)
Ten bitches and they dime so it's ten I see, Hail Mary!
Put my wrist on froze, presidential is gold
Nigga play with my money, my shooters lifting his soul (Blow!)
That kick like it's soccer, bullets hitting the goal
Bitch, I’m like John Wall 'cause I just give 'em and go
Plotting on this new 7, I can picture me rolling
Pockets look like they pregnant because them bitches is swollen
Got a clip I can loan, all them snitches could hold 'em
Look at the motherfuckin' wheels! Them bitches is stolen
They screamin'

2Pac back, 2Pac back
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better picture me rollin’
Riding brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming, "2Pac back, 2Pac back"
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back

[Verse 2: Meek Mill]
Mommy a soldier, daddy is dead
We catch the nigga that did it then we gon' carry his head
Fuck a 911, tell 'em have him a bed
I'm talking Death Row Records, tell 'em have me a chair
And let it burn, I'm screaming, "Free my nigga Hearn"
He drew with no hesitation, we can’t even get a turn
Copped my Makaveli CD and I listened and I learned
Grabbed my MAC above the dresser, my OG said, "Hold it firm"
I’m dreaming spitting with Pac (Pac!) and cyphers with B.I.G (B.I.G!)
Tried to send me upstate with the lifers and bid
Had me scraping my wax, sleeping, my knife in the bed
They got a nigga on point like it's a price on my head
I'm going max! Got me knocking suckers on they back
In these cells raising hell tryna get back to the trap
But don't ever get it twisted, it's Meek Mill, we spittin' facts (Meek Milly!)
Plus somebody said they seen it and they mean it
So they steady screamin'
[Chorus: Rick Ross]
2Pac back, 2Pac back
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
All eyes on me, better picture me rollin’
Riding brand new rims, but them bitches is stolen
Stranded on Death Row, Brenda having my baby
But I’m stacking my paper, I need a brand new Mercedes
They screaming "2Pac back, 2Pac back"
That’s all these bitches screaming that 2Pac back
