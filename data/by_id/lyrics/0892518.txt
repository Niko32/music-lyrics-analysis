I got myself a razor
Makes me strong enough to face her
Razorblade, I got myself a razorblade

Razorblade, I got myself a razorblade
I'll let you count my stitches
Let you know how much it itches
Razorblade, I got myself a razorblade
Don't need a switchblade or a knife
To deprive someone their lives

Come take a walk with me
I got something you must see
Don't let the moment fade
While I take out my razorblade

Razorblade, I got myself a razorblade
Even though it cuts real deep
It still won't make you weep
Razorblade, I got myself a razorblade
Don't need a time bomb or a gun
If we're going to have some fun
Don't have to slash your wrist
Just to prove that you exist
Look at this scars it made
While I take out my razorbladeYou might also like
