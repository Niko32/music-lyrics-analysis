Rrah!

[Verse 1]
All you slingers and fiends hide behind your rocks
Put down your guard, I'm not here to box
This is no showdown so throw down your guns
You see it doesn't matter where you come from
You could be from Park Ave or from a park bench
You could be a politician or a bitchy princess
But if you're lookin' for a fist and you're lookin' to unite
Put your knuckleheads together, make a fist and fight
Not to your death and not to your grave
I'm talkin' 'bout that freedom, fight like a brave

[Chorus]
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you, you've got to be afraid

[Verse 2]
If you're sick-a-sick 'n' tired of being sick and tired
If you're sick of all the bullshit and you're sick of all the lies
It's better late than never to set-a-set it straight
You know the lie is dead so give yourself a break
Or get it through your head and get it off your chest
Or get it out your arm because it's time to start fresh
You want to stop dying, the life you could be livin'
I'm here to tell a story but I'm also here to listen
No I'm not your preacher and I'm not your physician
I'm just a-trying to reach you, I'm a rebel with a mission
You might also like[Chorus]
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave, don't be a slave
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid

[Interlude]
I am here today to talk about the Uplift Mofo Party Plan
A plan based on a band, a band based on a plan
There shall be no slaves in the land of lands
It's a Hollywood jam

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
You say you're running and you're running and you're running afraid
You say you ran across the planet but you couldn't get away
The fire in your brain was driving you insane
You were looking for a day in a life that never came
So don't tell me that, I've got to take a number
'Cause I've been to that doctor and believe me, that's a bummer
He's one of a kind, convention of the mind
And don't forget to mention that it doesn't cost a dime
Come as you like and leave at any time
And one more thing, you know it doesn't have to rhyme
[Outro]
Fight like a brave (fight like a brave) don't be a slave (another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave (fight like a brave) don't be a slave (another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave (fight like a brave) don't be a slave (another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave (fight like a brave) don't be a slave (another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
Fight like a brave (fight like a brave) don't be a slave (another slave)
No one can tell you you've got to be afraid
