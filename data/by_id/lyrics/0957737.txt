You know that I've been here before
And as I lay awake the darkness closes in
I see your face and I feel the fire
As it burns inside my soul I live again

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been down before
But I would have let you know
When your heart is weak
And my love lies dying

[Chorus]
I'll be the one who's by your side
Before the night is over
Losing this war with my own pride
I'd die before I'd let you down

[Refrain]
Tonight you know
I tried to make it right
When your heart is weak
And my love lies dying

[Verse 2]
You knew that I wouldn't walk away
If I was half the man I used to be I could
Oh, I know it's all just another lie, yeah
And you know I'll still keep coming back
Running back to you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I've been down before
And I wanna let you know
When your heart is weak
And my love lies dying

[Chorus]
I'll be the one who's by your side
Before the night is over
Losing this war with my own pride
I'd die before I'd let you down

[Bridge]
Tonight you know I tried to make it right
When your heart is weak
And my love lies dying tonight
Yeah
And your love lies dying

[Chorus]
I'll be the one who's by your side
Before the night is over
Losing this war with my own pride
I'd die before I'd let you down
I'll be the one who's by your side
Before the night is over
Losing this war with my own pride
I'd die before I'd let you down
[Outro]
And your love lies dying
(Love lies dying)
I'll be the one, I'll be the one
Before the night is over
Before the night is over
