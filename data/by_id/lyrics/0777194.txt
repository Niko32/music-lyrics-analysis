Everything I knew wouldn’t last
Settled all my strife with a knife and a gun
A murderer is what I’ve become
Somebody better wash my mouth out
Somebody better wash it out
Knew a girl I thought was a friend
(I thought I knew ya but that ain’t true nah)
Everything she’s done, oh she’d defend
(You think you weren’t heard, I’ve got the last word)
She talked all this shit just to try and bring me down, HEY!
But all she’s left with is a dirty mouth
(I thought I knew ya but that ain’t true nah)
Somebody better wash her mouth out
Oh somebody better wash it out
He lured her in with charm
Made her keep her mouth shut
Pulled out all the stops
Such a little show- off
Thinking I don’t know
Play me for a fool
Blinding all your friends
But the only fool is you
The fool is you
Somebody better wash his mouth out
Somebody better wash it out
Somebody better wash his mouth out
Somebody better wash it out
(You think you weren’t heard I’ve got the last word)
Somebody better, somebody better
Somebody better wash his mouth out
Somebody better wash it outYou might also like
