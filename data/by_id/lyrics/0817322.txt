Sydney's in sunshine but it's cold as sin
Everyone walks leaning into the wind
On Crown Street I wait for my expensive friend
I can see by his eyes I'm in trouble again
I hurry down Broadway my time's drawing near
Come Independence Day I'm in the clear
Set 'em up Bruce, let's drink one more beer
'Cause I'm leaving her for the last time
I'm all done with walking the line
I'm leaving her for the very last time
And I'm through with reason and wine
I'm leaving her for the very last time
In more ways than one I was totally blind
Yes I admit that I missed every sign
Now my reputation has lost all it's shine
Lights on at Central, a train's heading south
I don't care if it looks like I'm running out
Set 'em up Bruce, this time it's my shout
I'm leaving her for the last time
I'm all done with changing my mind
I'm leaving her for the very last time
And I'm through with reasoning why
I'm leaving her for the very last timeYou might also like
