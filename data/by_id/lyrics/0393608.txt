I'm gonna make it rain
From all the syllables that I be dropping, but
You got no right to complain
Just because what I might say may be shocking
I know what I want
It's everything more than what you've been willing to front
You beg and you plead
What a waste of an effort
It won't be long now 'fore I'm spilling your blood
I'm coming to town with a horse and a carriage
You paid 50 grand for a car
You embarrassed?
Monotonous spending
Provocative products is turning the arts to a billboard in Paris
We are the pinnacle of the innumerable wack rappers
Counting stacks, backing a track with no lyrical merit
Hysterically lyrical syllable slaughter
Competing with me, you're just begging for death
And you'll never beat me come hell or high water
'Cause maybe your lyrics are average at best
Ripping it up, and we go independent everyday
If you ever talking shit, we'd be happy to defenestrate
We're intimidating, gonna get it to the top
And maybe sell a record since we can't afford to stop
Gonna give it all I got and then a little more
It's inevitable that we're gonna get a tour
Underestimating an impenetrable force
Like us, you'll be up against the weather waiting for
COdominance, bro!
We plotted a tornado course
Ain't no thing, and I can sense that you fellas are as envious
As the Grinch around Christmas
Roast beasts
That's what I do for a living
And I'm the guy with the glasses, so it's proof I got vision
Now I wanna see the bodies all moving in rhythm
(mr.)blankslate 'bout to fuck this track so stay truthful and listen

Those protocols don't harm me
I'm bonafide, not smarmy
And I broke away from that monotone now isn't that alarming?
Don't be dismayed when I drift away, just watch my velvet wings take flight
In a run-down town in the middle of the night:
Rock bottom of the well got debt to climb
And I can't recall the last time I wasn't battling anxiety - shit -
I've sacrificed too much for rap and have yet to get it back, like tit for tatt
I'm over that; every chick that I been with cheated = knife to the back
Rise like a phoenix; feel a light wrath in a life raft get your right craft
On-board and taught with the remix
We surf on the surface surgically, usurpin' simple serpentine subordinates
I serve e'm up with some shit from beyond the circus
Circumnavigate the storms that'll make you selfish
Abolish Charaltarian involvement, maannn
We speak with certain statements
We be sophisticated
We are just gettin' started
Face you see is the real MC, no we don't get carded
