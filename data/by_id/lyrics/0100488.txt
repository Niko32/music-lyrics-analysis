VS.1
I’ve said it from the beginning, If I got a gift, I deliver it a little different
I gotta do it, cause I swear I’m about to ruin this, so let me back it up and get a little better view of this
Stay tuned, Cause I’m fluent with it, Uh, and I used to be a hypocrite and used it like a chump
And I would preach about it, how it was number 1. Hour after hour I’m wondering how I sunk
The one that got away got me stuck, so now that I got her back I’m polishing the chucks
And I’ma give it up, get the drama, ship it up to Colorado, Give a fuck as long I don’t let it follow us
And I don’t got a problem no more. Yup, I’m all yours
And I don’t gotta force, or course, I’m all for it
I could give a shit about a forbes list, I’m just tryna court this chick, I assure you this

Hook
I ain’t got time so I’m gone
I got a couple shows that I’m tryin to go to
Got a couple summers that I’m trying to coast thru
I’m trying to show you, that I ain’t got time
I ain’t got time so I’m gone

VS.2
So let me tell you about this issue, my mind would miss you
And at the same time, my eyes would slip through, flip to the side dismiss you
Dissing you and you don’t even know if it is true, so call me Mr.Pitiful
I got it in. and that was the problem back then
And since I had a ‘10’ and I was looking for the fence
Looking around at ‘7’s’ had me shook and losing ends
And it wasn’t only you, sad saying, but its true
Every girl I dated, I hate it, but I was stupid
Cupid got ahold of me and told me I would lose it
Told me if I keep it up, the creepin would just prove it
He had a full clip, and he was about to put me out
Now I’m here, seeing clear, like yeah, no doubt
I got it now, cause I understood the concept
Don’t stress, let me redefine honesty

So let me finish this written off, spitting off bars bout living, and all the hard feelings
This thought that you ain’t got control, is so old
If you fronting on the outside you feel it in your soul
Yeah you admit it, but the thing is, shit don’t nobody know
You know it but you show a different love over the phone
You really think, they don’t hear it in your tone?
The fact that you believe that is the reason why you gone
And if he or she drops you, Don’t even try to stop
Cause you blocked and the honesty finally got you
So let me stop you, let me turn around so I can rock with you
Cause i’ve been tryna find, this thing called peace of mind
Diamond in the ruff and I ain’t leaving mine
And I really try to mean it but I’m leaving and I’m fine
