All of the high ups
Thank you pariah
Danger danger in this scene
That’s coming apart at its seams
And all for not

I’ve been running hard for so long
That I don’t know if I could drink
Even if you gave me water

There’s only hope
After so many turned on us
Foes eyes wore a friend’s disguise
In the end we were villainized

I’ve been running hard for so long
That I don’t know if I could sleep
Even with a bed to lay on

There’s only room
For those who believe in us
Persona non grata
Come see the world through a villain’s eyes

There’s a danger in defying
All of the high ups
Thank you pariah, pariah, pariahYou might also like
