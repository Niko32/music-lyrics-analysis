It's no news to youâ€¦
No longer delay the truth, I've needed to push off for some time
Promise to keep your mind with you and I'll return your heart
But now it's time to find out about all with which I'm made
My fragments were scattered across every last shore
Within the efforts to create this now dissolving race
Ages ago we would die to further the whole but we've since forgotten our place
Patiently etching glass through scenes that make everyday
Adrift triangular bliss where every side equates
Creatures beneath have never counted a league
Nor have they tracked the sun until it falls asleep
The wind picks up and the water is getting rough, as I tread the angry earth's working brain
With each wave comes a chance of being erased
What's left of me is violently swept to land; land that I had taken for granted
My pieces were scattered across every last shore when I tried my hand in the game
(May the waves help carry my sound, and send home love from men who won't be found.)
Ages ago I promised I'd return your heart, whole. But it seems the plans have changed
(I beg the waves recall when I said, "as long as you live, I'll live through you.")
