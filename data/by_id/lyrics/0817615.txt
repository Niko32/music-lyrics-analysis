This time I'm leaving you
This time
I'm never coming back, never coming back, never coming back
Pack my bags you'll never see my face again
Never coming back [x3]
I'm leaving you
If you never
Never see my face again [x3]
If you never see my face again
Coming back
Never coming back [x7]
This time I'm leaving you
Iforgot to say good night
I forgot to say good morning [x2]
I'm leaving you
Never coming back [x4]You might also like
