Safe in the eye of the storm
Mercy and faith keep me warm
Oh the dreams I have seen tattered and torn
Just when I think I cannot take any more

[Chorus]
You give me shelter and never will I be alone
Hold me closer and help me to find my way home
Cause it is a long road through the darkest of nights
But your love will not let me lose sight
Of the glory of life

[Verse 2]
High is this mountain I climb
Deep is this river of time
The devils got trouble in mind
Sometimes I stumble
But you are there to remind me
Standing right there beside me

[Chorus]
You give me shelter and never will I be alone
Hold me closer and help me to find my way home
Cause it is a long road through the darkest of nights
But your love will not let me lose sight
Of the glory of life
You might also like[Verse 3]
This world has left me tangled up inside
Nowhere left to hide
And the wind and rain
Is bearing down on me
(Baring down, wearing down on me)

[Chorus]
You give me shelter and never will I be alone
Hold me closer and help me to find my way home
Through the darkest of nights
But your love will not let me lose sight

You give me shelter and never will I be alone
Hold me closer and help me to find my way home
Cause it is a long road through the darkest of nights
But your love will not let me lose sight
Of the glory of life
