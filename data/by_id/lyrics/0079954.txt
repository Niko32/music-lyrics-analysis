I deliver hip-hop like I deliver flash kicks
Often
I off them
Sonic booms with my music
Man I know you bump your heads to this
And it's hard to miss
Creating hits out of thin air
Something like an alchemist
Got these critics scared
Guessing I'm a threat to them
Hah
Psycho Crushing all my competition
You can't parry man
This ain't Street Fighter Alpha
You can take this North
You can take this South because
Nerdy rap ain't as hard to understand
Unlike Calculus
I'm hitting right home
They're hitting left because
They're all leaving home alone
And it's sad see
They should quit while the roads still ahead
Spittin' lyrics for these nerds
Hear what I said?
They wish they could be me
Helen Keller haters homie
They can't even see me

Living this life
Got to do what I can
Care for my kin
And be a family man
NBD on my side
No one understands
The bond of a team that can match any man [x2]
Living like a street fighter
Super meter gets higher
Head bands and battered gloves
Battling every day to gain TRIUMPH

[Verse 2: DNick]

Let me function on my own
Disable your control port
Rapping is a hobby
More like my favorite sport
And you can retort
But I don't really care
I Jordan Sparks the track
Left it gasping for some air
Man I'm childish
Shout out to Gambino
Gold on my body
C3PO
Painted man
I'm really Silver
But I'm not week enough to let the shadows of my past affect my future
Marty McFly on a hover board
Mickey Mouse fly
Homie I am never bored
The world is my theme park
Life has me high even when my thoughts seem dark
Uh
Yeah I'm thankful for these Chun-Li's
They have my back everyday
Constantly
The constant pleas of the people begging on their knees
Wishing they could have a chance to rep with us in NBD
