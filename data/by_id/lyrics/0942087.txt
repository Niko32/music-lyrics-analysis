A sweet stranger she entered in
The night was dark, the wind it roared
Beauty she did bring
Greed and gold
Greed and gold
Forever the loneliest road
Welcome fine lady, won't you stay this night?
For fortunes may unfold
I see precious jewels you keep so tight
Like a sweet child out from the cold
Greed and gold
Greed and gold
Forever the loneliest road
A silent room in the dead of night
Two lovers lay there entwined
From a deep sleep to her bed I creep
Great treasures there I find
The midnight moon all across her face
It steals her out from a dream
The mirror smashed, sharp silver flashed
Broken beauty she did scream, crying:
Greed and gold
Greed and gold
Forever the loneliest road
Greed and gold
Greed and gold
Forever the loneliest road
Early in the morn you will find me gone
I'll seek a dark distant shore
I'll walk in fear but always hear
Her knocking at my front door
She's crying:
Greed and gold
Greed and gold
Forever the loneliest road
Greed and gold
Greed and gold
Forever the loneliest roadYou might also like
