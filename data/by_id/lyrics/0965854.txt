Like a buffalo herd from a shotgun blast scattered in flight
I got a one track mind
Going down a one train line
Living on dreams half the time
Going west

I gotta pick up speed
Just to get what I need
The end of the line guaranteed
Your love is my rest

The coal catches fire and I'm down the wire in a flash
That big old smoksack is belching out black smoke and ash
So sad to think of
Hurting the one you love
But surely that's what leaving does
You'd know best

I gotta pick up speed
Just to get what I need
The end of the line guaranteed
Your love is my rest

I stand in the land of Custer's last stand and I grin
So this is where old yellow-hair's ghost-dance begins
I got the blood on my hands
Can't even live where I stand
I'm just a travelling man
Cursed or blessed
You might also likeI gotta pick up speed
Just to get what I need
The end of the line guaranteed
Your love is my rest
