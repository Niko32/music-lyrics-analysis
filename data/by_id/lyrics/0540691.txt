[Verse 1: Jon Nerdigg]
Damn girl now things are getting heavy all up in between your thighs water's bout to break the levy
Every time we chillin' seems we end up in the bed
On any other day I tell you go ahead
But instead baby girl lets do it in this chair
Four legs on the ground and two in the ayer
Up until this point our friendship was plutonic
Now you're stuck on me the way that I was hooked on Phonics
No nice things to give you, isn't that ironic
All I got is furniture and girl you should be on it

[Bridge 1: Jon Nerdigg]
Please don't take offense to this
When I see your legs I can't resist
Lovin your body is my only wish
On a chair everyday baby perfect bliss

[Pre Chorus 1: Jon Nerdigg]
Though I know you said, we'd take this to the bed
Nothing can compare to sex on a chair

[Chorus: Jon Nerdigg]
Sex on a chair
Sex on a chair

Some rappers they rap about dealin', but you know me I just record how I'm feelin'
You never have to doubt it, you know that I'm for realin'
Girl let me see the thoughts that your eyes are concealin'
Im sittin', your kneelin' my eyes to the cellin'
Thank God for this sexual healin
I wanna do it from that scene from Juno
You know the part I mean your my numero uno
In the chair-mobile we're a climatic duo
Pushin' hard to the finish breathin' heavy, Ooo oh
Sex on a chair is the vision that I'm dreamin
Now we can give our love seat a more literal meaning

[Pre Chorus 2: Jon Nerdigg]
Actings never there, this girl gives me a stare
Pull my recline lever, sex on a chair

[Chorus: Jon Nerdigg]
Sex on a chair
Sex on a chair

[Verse 3: Jon Nerdigg]
Now don't think that we all be jokin'
I'm not Heath Ledger with my mouth cut open
I don't gotta clue if fatty j's been talkin'
Girl why so serious your figure is smokin'
Your lips, your hips, your hair scrambled thoughts were provokin'
The way you grid that ottoman is really got me hopin'
That the soft bends and curves of your body I'll be strokin'
Your hips, your lips, this chair, come on lets get it goin
This lazy boy is about to go to work on you
Tight grasp in the arms, till your patience is through
The beat your body is making is the song I bump to
Spread your legs on the chair, baby that's my cue
That's my cue, thats my cue baby that's my cue
Hello, thank you
[Bridge 2: Jon Nerdigg]
Why I'm still a rappin' is a mystery
The space below your waist is where my face should be
Better than a betty crocker recipe
Sittin' on my rocker girl you're so tasty

[Verse 4: Jon Nerdigg]
Girl so freaky like a blair witch project
Took her to my house, leather chair I'm on it
Trimmed like a hedge I rolled on her like sonic
Kept plaguin her body till she called me bubonic
Bad girl bad girl whatcha gonna do
Whatcha gonna do when the chair's brand new
Not a grandmother so my chair is not plastic covered
But it's bout to get messy, so help me with this rubber


[Pre Chorus 3: Jon Nerdigg]
Glad she is my lover I'm so undeserving of her
When she lets me explore regions of her body undiscovered
Always feels the best when what we share is connected
Convulsing to a finish like this chair's electric

[Chorus: Jon Nerdigg]
Sex on a chair
Sex on a chair
Verse 5: Jon Nerdigg
I know these verses ain't my normal style
But Ice Cube's hook got me actin wild
With that bein' said this occasion is rare
So come on girl lets have sex on a, chair
