I worked long hours and I was poorly paid
Then I was 20 and I met my wife
A working class hero I was ready for life

[Chorus:]
The times are hard and the wages low
As I went out it was time to go
Run all over the land run all over the town
Everywhere I go they would turn me down

The kids came along, two girls and two boys
Our cottage was full of living and noise
I worked for the bossman from early to late
I was made foreman and I thought it was great

[Chorus]
The factory′s closing the well has run dry
No money to live, no money to die
The work has been cut to four hours a day
It′s so hard to leave but it′s harder to stay
