I found these plastic parts and wires
Let's split me open at the seams
And rip out everything inside
Make room for all this new machine
Sew me up; pray that I survive
A brand-new me
Piece by piece

[Chorus]
Stay here and watch me bleed
Watch me bleed
It's a brand-new me, piece by piece
Piece by piece

[Verse 2]
I'll leave a black tear in the sky
To help you remember what you've seen
And then I'll set this place on fire
Just break and burn down everything
I'm made of plastic parts and wires now
I won't feel anything

[Pre-Chorus]
Start the countdown
Just make me fall asleep
You might also like[Chorus]
Stay here and watch me bleed
Watch me bleed
It's a brand-new me, piece by piece
Piece by... piece

[Bridge]
My flesh, my bones, my blood
They hold my hate, my love
They hold my hate and my pain...
Just take a breath and walk away

[Chorus]
Stay here and watch me bleed
Watch me bleed
It's a brand-new me, piece by piece
Piece by...

[Outro]
Piece by...
Piece by...
Piece by piece
