The three faced god
Whom cries forth crocodile tears
A megalith of whores
Caress my yellow skin
Mine is the voice of nothingness
The heir of true desecration
O' sacred bread of shame
Take us down the path to hedon
Doth we begin the ceremony?
I light the ritual pyre
I lead the whimpering lamb
Into the holy orgy
I am Gomorrah!You might also like
