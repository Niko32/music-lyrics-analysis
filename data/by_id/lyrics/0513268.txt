Well, they'll seat us in the sun
By the way
Know you've always been the one

You'll ask your reasons why
What once was yours is mine
My baby's gone

Ride away
Gonna take me from my man
By the way
No, they'll never understand

We'll have a bit of fun
Watching everyone pass us by

You'll ask your reason why
What once was yours is mine
My baby's gone
