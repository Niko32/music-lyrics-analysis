It's just something that you do, so, easy
Acting out just like a child, living your life somewhere in denial
I know, that you know, that we, should, never

Free me, from the abyss, hear me now, the silence in you
Breathe for, a moment or two, hear me now, the silence, yeah

So you're draining me from more, the price to pay: Forever
Know you love to see me fall, so far, behind
You don't care for me at all, it's like I never get it all
I know, that you know, that we, should, never

Free me, from the abyss, hear me now, the silence in you
Breathe for, a moment or two, hear me now, the silence

So, free me, you know what to do, hear me now, the silence in you
Breathe for, a moment or two, hear me now, the silence in you, in you, in you
The silence in you, in you, in you, the silence in youYou might also like
