The anger turned within
What do I gain for all my pain?
Perhaps a seat in Heaven?

Don't do what you want
Do what you're taught is right
Your life is built on paranoia and guilt
Don't forget your Valium tonight

The agony I must endure, my mind is painful and swells
The punishment for what I've done is forever the pains of hell
How come what is natural has to be a sin?
Why would God give me this urge if I cannot give in?
They say don't give up, that Jesus loves me
But there's some things he doesn't forgive
I know I have sinned and am therefore worthless
And I don't deserve to live!

I went down into my basement confused and depressed, put Black Sabbath on
Razor blade in hand—a Wilkinson I think—ten slashes on each arm
My only wrongdoing was being born human and following my instincts
I never was happy, I never was sane, so I shall be extinct
The growing pool of crimson, at last I am pure
Witness my sanguineous penance
I don't need anyone, my soul's been set free
Death is total independence!
