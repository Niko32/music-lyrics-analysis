Damn, a nigga faded forever
Look at the squad, see all my niggas made it together
I’m going hard cause you know being broke is a never
I’m touching work and right now I ain’t got time to text you
My Rollie over the horn as I pull up at the light
And tonight I done bought a couple bitches a flight
See I’m the wheres the money homie, fuck the interview type
And I live every fuckin' day like it’s the end of my life
See I might holler at a bitch, see what her energy like
Some hoes be frontin' and they be on you, remember me right
No-no ho-ho, I’m so forgetful, I don’t remember faces
Unless they green faces, young Rockie getting paper, yeah
