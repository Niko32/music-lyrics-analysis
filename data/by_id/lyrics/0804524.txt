[Verse 1]
C'mon everybody take a trip with me
Way down to Mississippi down to New Orleans
Where the honeysuckle's bloomin' on the honeysuckle vine
And love is bloomin' there all the time
Every Southern belle is a Mississippi Queen
Down the Mississippi, down in New Orleans

I said-a hey, hey, hey, yeah
(I said-a hey, hey, hey, yeah)
I said-a hey, hey, hey, yeah
(I said-a hey, hey, hey, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Well, c'mon, take a stroll down on Basin street
And listen to the music with the Dixieland beat
Where the magnolia blossoms they fill the air
And if you ain't been to heaven then you ain't been there
You got French moss hanging from a big oak tree
Down the Mississippi, down to New Orleans
You might also like[Refrain]
I said-a hey, hey, hey, yeah
(I said-a hey, hey, hey, yeah)
I said-a look out, child, yeah, yeah, yeah
(I said-a look out, child, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3]
C'mon everybody take a trip with me
Way down to Mississippi, down to New Orleans
Where the honeysuckle's bloomin' on the honeysuckle vine
And love is bloomin' there all the time
Every Southern belle is a Mississippi queen
Down the Mississippi, down in New Orleans, ow
