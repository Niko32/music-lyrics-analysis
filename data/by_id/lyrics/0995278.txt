We was hypnotized by the river of lights
ANd never saw him until he passed us by
On a giant metal wagon that was open to the sky

No cab to protect him, no trailer for his load
He sat up there upon his chair alone against the road
With just a helmet on his head and a tiny piece of board against the wind
Lord, he drove that empty chassis like a man being hounded by his sins

And he was singing
"I drive the roads that are closed by the Ancient Old Ones
( Scarey H.P. Lovecraft monsters )
And I know the paths of the lonesome highway doomed
Shot my boss, killed his dog, left his children in the street
And now I ride, ride, ride the truck of fear
When the doomed go shopping, boy, there ain't no stopping
We're just happy to be here"

The wolves were howling as he drove up to our side
I felt a chill of terror, a fear I could not hide
I smelled the diesel on his breath as he whispered right into my ear
"Son, you'll never feel so doomed as when you ride the truck of fear
Boy, you'll never feel so doomed as when you ride the truck of fear"
We're headed for the rubber room upon the truck of fearYou might also like
