I just picked me a plum
You came along
And everything started to hum

Still it's a real good bet
The best is yet to come

The best is yet to come
And babe, won't that be fine?
You think you've seen the sun
But you ain't seen it shine

Wait till the warm up's underway
Wait till out lips have met
Wait till you see that sunshine day
You ain't seen nothing yet

The best is yet to come
And babe, won't that be fine?
The best is yet to come
Come, the day you're mine

Ooh, come the day that you're mine
I'm gonna teach you to fly
We've only tasted the wine
We're gonna drain the cup dry
You might also likeWait till your charms are right
For these arms to surround
You think you've flown before
But baby, you ain't left the ground

Wait till you're locked in my embrace
Wait till I draw you near
Wait till you see that sunshine place
There ain't nothing like it here

The best is yet to come
And babe, won't that be fine?
The best is yet to come
Come, the day you're mine

Come, the day you're mine
And you're gonna be mine
