So many people angry wit hate
People don't understand heartache
Seeing smiles everywhere, boys fighting like crazy
Dark ways for ladies
People don't relize wot they been through
Long ago their relationship was through
Heartbroken, in tears not a clue
New niggas walkin shoes
Oh no it just had to happen to me
No love for me
I don't know how long it will last
Not checking time, nah
I'm the one fallin staying queit
Cuz if I talk someone starts a riot
Why is this happening to me?
Why me?
I can't say
Where do I take this pain?
There's nothing left for me here
But I can't escape from here
Time is getting further away from sense
It's so dence
Where do I go from here?

[Verse Two]
Everybody here has had there heartbroken
Everyone has had something stolen
Never returning at all
Not even through a phone call
Protesting for a new chance
And do things right & not laugh
Do what they should've done long ago
Say wot dey should've said long ago
But I'm the only one wit a heartache
Now it's too late
Everyone took advantage
While I took it for granted.
