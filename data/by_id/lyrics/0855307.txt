Whose a knocking at the door
I failed to see
What they want from me
Had a dreadful night
Fighting for my life
Now I'm a man of misery
You got me on my knees
You're just a naughty little tease
You really knock me out
The way you're putting it about
I had a dreadful night
Fighting with the white
Now I'm a man of misery
But the kids all right
He's got a ticket to ride
One things for sure
He'll leaving wanting more
Bye bye
I said the kids all right
He's got a ticket to ride
One things for sure
He'll leaving wanting more
Bye bye
