Im loyal to my money cus money wul never snitch

I never bite a hand and i never burn a bridge

I dont want problems wit a nigga or a b*tch

Cus problems are a problem and problems dont get u rich

Niggas movin birds we choppin up pelicans

Countin all that cash the rush is adrenaline

Drug money took me places that i neva been

Only hero that i seen it starts with heroine

A struggle in my hood  i was tryin to escape

I Went to bed so hungry i had a dream that i ate

I Was Wakin up alone ain have a thing on my plate

My father loccd up and all my niggas relate
You might also likeI overcame the obstacles i hold myself responsible

Even wen yu at yur best  they bad mouthin you

They said i never make it like this was so impossible

I graduated college so this rappin shit is optional

I represent the hood ima preacher for the streets

God i send my grief to angels that be deceased

Lord before i leave the goals that i achieve

Is To have my niggas floss like they cleanin out they teeth

People ain generous they envious

And niggas that dont like u be the friendliest

Haters be the emptiest

They knew that i was starvin but still they werent feedin me

The second i get signed see im aimin for obesity
My day ones eat wit me the money split it equally

Nigga we was broke that bread we got it recently

My old head told me never brag wit liars

They career like a car wen u slash they tire

They said i wouldn't make it im jus dashin higher

My jobs to shut em up so i jus pass em firee

Rappers they be gassin shit talkin wit petroleum

All my niggas listen im obama at the podium

Niggas got them keys and no they not custodian

And they Sellin coke to kids thats bricalodean

Jus because he rap dont mean the nigga nice

Gettin signed is a gamble and im leavin wit the dice

Busy chasin money my goal is to get out the hood
Bitches come and go the sex i mean its prolly good

I never tried to fuc em all once im rich i prolly could

U Bitches actin hollywood but never been to holy wood

Shoppin overseas in italy we be spendin

We walkin on money my brothers be euro steppin

Niggas gettin jelous im sportin out margielas

Bitch im bout my buccs im feelin like monta ellis

All i do is sin but my mother named me jesus

My past is completed and i hope it gets deleted

Fuccin wit these skeezers gettin brain jus like genius

She keep that box hot n ready lik lil cesars

Half these Rappers fake they snakes jus like medusa

The other half trash and they shul be producers

Loyalty is rare and i wul never fake u

If i love u then i love u if i hate u then ihate u

Actions never break uu and words shul never make u

Cedric rest in peace im askin u be my angel

I lost a couple homies and that wasreally painful

All my brothers real for that i say im thankful
