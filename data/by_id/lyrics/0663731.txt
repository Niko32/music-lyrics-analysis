Somewhere between the graveyard and the forest, I'm somewhere just smoking
The temperature drop but, for me, it's still hot, 'cause I'm from where it's snowing
Weatherman reporting "Woods get stale, so remember to close 'em"
Don't fuck with my motion, catch me a case and then close it like Conan
6 in the mornin', don't do no yawnin', creep while you sleep, thought you said that you want it
Feast when I eat, while you pourin' up porridge, rather be me then be what you supposed to
But that mean you'll never be nothin' but fake, so watch how I do it and say that you hate
Then copy and paste and say we can relate, to not be original, that ain't a lane
But somehow they livin' like that every day, way too content with just lookin' the same
Same fuckin' views, same fucking brain
Fuck is a label? Somebody, please tell me, if there's a contract, they know not to involve me
I roll all the nickels, I make all my money, so how the fuck you supposed to tempt me with hundreds?
What is a thousand, what is a million to someone that knows the price has risen?
SESH is who with me, moving too quickly, no feature prices, this shit changing weekly
Death is so easy, life is so random, now he just do it, and money, they hand him
Some get a check and go live in the Hamptons, me, I buy fruit, dope, and diamonds in cash

[Outro]
What?
Wait
