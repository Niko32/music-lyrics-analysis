I'm waiting for the sun to shine
Mercy
I'm waiting for the sun to shine

Standing here against the night
With this beauty upon our sight
If it don't kill you, it'll hurt you some
If it don't kill you, it'll hurt you some

Mercy build and mercy break
Yours to give and yours to take
And when the world tries to call you away
You say

Mercy
I'm waiting for the sun to shine
Mercy
I'm waiting for the sun to shine

And all this cathedral
That you have in your eyes
Is violent, revealing
From the ground to the sky

Is it warm or is it cold? Is it young or is it old?
And if you can't touch the naked body of her soul
She will fall asleep on you, the world will tell you what to do
Until the hands and guns and hearts and songs, they say, mercy

I'm waiting for the sun to shine
Mercy
I'm waiting for the sun to shine

Mercy
I'm waiting for the sun to shine
Mercy
I'm waiting for the sun to shine
