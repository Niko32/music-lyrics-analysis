Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Look at my heart floating away

[Verse 1]
He's the kind of guy that would say
"Hey baby, let's get away let's go some place far"
Well, I don't care
He's the kind of guy that you give your everything
Your trust, your heart, share all of your love, 'til death do you part

I wanna be what he wants me, when he wants me
And whenever he needs me
And when he's lonesome and feelin' love starved
I'll be there to feed him
I'm givin' him a little bit more each day
He turns me right on when I hear him say

Hey baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere far
Baby, can we?
Well, I don't care
Hey baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere far
Baby, can we?
Well, I don't care

And whenever he needs me
And when he's lonesome and feelin' love starved
I'll be there to feed him
Lovin' him a little bit more each day
It turns me right on just to hear him say, ooh

Hey baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere far
Baby, can we?
Well, I don't care, oh
Hey baby, let's get away, let's go somewhere far
Baby, can we?
Well, I don't care
Where you wanna go?

Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
Day dreamin' and I'm thinkin' of you
