It's not a joke here, it's a curse
My luck is changing, it has gotten
From simply rotten to something worse
Who knows, someday I will win too
I'll begin to reach my prime
Now though I see what our end is
All I can send is just my time
I can't give you anything but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream a while, scheme a while
We're sure to find happiness and I guess
All those things you've always planned for
Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets, Woolworth's doesn't sell, baby
'Till that lucky day, you know darn well, baby
I can't give you anything but love
Baby, baby
I can't give you any little thing but love, baby
That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
Dream a while, scheme a while
We're sure to find happiness and I guess
All those things you've always planned for
Gee, I'd like to see you looking swell, baby
Diamond bracelets Woolworths doesn't sell, baby
'Till that lucky day, you know darn well, baby
I can't give you anything but love
That's allYou might also like
