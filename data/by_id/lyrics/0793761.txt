Breathe my name, what does it say?
On your tongue, how does it taste?
When it pulses through your veins
Tell me if you feel the same
Tell me if you feel the same

[Verse 2]
Say my name, what does it tell you?
Trust your heart for it remains true
When all else seems to delude you
You will Know what lives inside you
You will Know what lives inside you

[Chorus]
Breathe – For in your breath you will find me
And I will Grace you – Beyond your wildest dreams
And I am here - You would never believe
If you knew - just how I know you in me

[Verse 3]
Breathe my name when you are lonely
I'll be there if you will let me
Feel my warmth as I caress you
Feel my lips and let them bless you
Feel my lips and let them bless you
You might also like[Chorus]
Breathe – For in your breath you will find me
And I will Grace you – Beyond your wildest dreams
And I am here - You would never believe
If you knew - just how I know you in me
