Way back in the pines of Carolina...
Closing down store...one year more
Of coming up short

CHORUS:
Hung heads and heavy sighs
Winter comin' on
What lil' was left is
Long....since....gone

The fields? they're all barren
Factory up & moved it overseas
Boarded up town
Ghosts walkin' the streets

And they all say one thing
Back on "the Hill"
It ain't come back yet
Maybe it never will

Old ways...old paths
All of 'em drowned...in a sea of progress
History doubles back...to shake hands with you
When you've got nothing to trade on...you've nothing left to loseYou might also like
