But love and affection this family afforded me
Worries came early and often it seemed
Fate was not pleasant still I was redeemed
Then compassion soon faded to chaos
As they did their best all the while
When circumstance outweighs intention
Sometimes the mountain's just too hard to climb

They were cruel, they were ignorant
They were beauty, they were kind
They were patience, they were virtue
They were crazy, they were mine

I was young and I thought I knew everything
It's so hard to change a fool's mind
When you're stubborn by nature and quick to the draw
And you're full of inherited pride
But some lessons come harder than others
And some senses are harder to find
Your troubles won't end when you're saved by the bell
You'll still answer to those you defied

They were cruel, they were ignorant
They were beauty, they were kind
They were patience, they were virtue
They were crazy, they were mine

But the heavens won't pay for your lies
The sinners might pray for your problems
But the sinners won't look in your eye

They were crazy, they were mine

They were cruel, they were ignorant
They were beauty, they were kind
They were patience, they were virtue
They were crazy, they were mine
They were cruel, they were ignorant
They were beauty, they were kind
They were patience, they were virtue
They were crazy, they were mine

The heavens might sing out your praises
But the heavens won't pray for your lies
The sinners might pay for your problems
But the sinner won't look in your eye
