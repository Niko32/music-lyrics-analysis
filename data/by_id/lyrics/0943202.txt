Money have I none
But I got silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun
Yeah I got silver in the stars
And gold in the morning sun

I'm never gonna kiss those ruby lips
Of the sweetest girl in town
I'm never gonna ask her to marry me
'Cause I know she'll turn me down

Oh, but I'm just a country boy
Yeah money have I none
But I've got silver in the stars
And gold in that morning sun
Yeah I got silver in those stars
And gold in that morning sunYou might also like
