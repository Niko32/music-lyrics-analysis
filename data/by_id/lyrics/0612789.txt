Wish I had just one more chance
To hold you close and say I love you
Can't believe that our romance was just beginning
Now it's through
I'm looking for tomorrow
To start a new life on my own
But all I see is sorrow
You're all I lived for
Now you're gone

[Chorus]
I can't seem to get you off my mind
No matter what I do
I'm trying to wipe you from my eyes
But the tears keep falling through
The hardest thing that love has put me through
Is getting over you (Over you), getting over you

[Chorus]
I can't seem to get you off my mind
No matter what I do
I'm trying to wipe you from my eyes
But the tears keep falling through
The hardest thing that love has put me through
Is getting over you (Over you), getting over you
You might also like[Outro]
Over you
Over you
