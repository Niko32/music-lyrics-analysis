Darling, you say you love me
Place no one above me
That was yesterday
It is so far away

[Chorus]
Girl, you are evil
Evil as you can be
One thing for sure
Devil better lock his door
You're evil

[Verse 2]
Well, darlin' you know it is true
He got a hold of you
Ain't you so naive
Man is on his knees

[Chorus]
Girl, you are evil
Evil as you can be
One thing for sure
Devil better lock his door
You're evil
You might also like[Verse 3]
I could wrestle with the guys
It wouldn't be my eyes
You're a crap-shoot every time
But your skin is thicker than mine

[Chorus]
Girl, you are evil
Evil as you can be
One thing for sure
Devil better lock his door
You're evil

[Outro]
You're evil
You're evil
You're evil
