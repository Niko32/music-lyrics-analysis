Ain’t no question if I want it, I need it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
I’m on the edge, so why you playing? I’m saying
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down
Not for nothing I’ve forseen it, I dream it
I can feel it slowly drifting away from me
No more chances if you blow this, you bogus
I will never ever let you live this down, down, down

[Verse 1: Tungatz D'LAW]
I think Im goin' out of my mind,I dont know anymore who am I worshipin'
God and love or Satan and his forces,better come with caution
If you wanna come closer to me,cause my distortion is
Gettin' high as fuck,man you dont wanna end unconscient
Cause my punches aren't physical,we dont need a mofuckin' dojo
Its psychological pain like a fucking abortion
My emotions are lookin' everyday more like the ocean
Sometimes they calm,sometimes they raw
Like a fuckin' storm,destroying everything while it pass
Sometimes I blame it on the grass,shoulda listen to my dad
Cause he told me that shit was bad,but hey!,Im young,inmortal
No time to think about the morals,I ain't nothing like these fuckin' mortals (no!)
So give me back those pills and please,roll one up and pour one
Cause If it's true that makes you forget,man it would be awesome
It might as well If I get in the internet and call some
Attractive hoes that would be down for a fuckin' foursome,bitch!

[Verse 2: Tungatz D'LAW]
2 years you could say that I've waste finding an end to this lucha
And the only thang that worked for me is to stay neutral
Everytime the brutal side of me want to reboot y'all
I promised God that I would say nothing but the truth,yo'
If I wanna be the realest,If you didn't know its crutial
Even If that makes you hate me and never date me
This loneliness ain't that bad,so surely I will keep it
Mr.West taught me that its better to be the dick than
Be the one that licks it,waiting for that elixir
I rather fall a million times than livin' on my knees bitch!
So if I got a rival,you know I won't put my other cheek
I'll defend myself and my family with my teeth
Yeah I thought I was a pacifist,but I was just livin' in fear
And they think the same shit,but I know that shit ain't real
Cause they always bark me,everytime they see my dark me
If you ain't wanna see it,then why the fuck you spark me?
We tha guilties of this shit,it's 50-50
Don't act like you an angel,you can't even lift it
And dont tell me that its easy,when you ain't even lived it
Its my own love that will save me from this fuckin' darkness
And only your own love can do the same shit for you
Ain't no saviours on this shit,that's my personal view
All that stay with Jesus shit,to me is cute but soft as cotton
Cause y'all still depressed as fuck,so I deep pressed tha mute button
