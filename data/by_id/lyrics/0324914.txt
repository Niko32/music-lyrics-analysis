Snapping pictures of my action figures
With my golf bags sagging I’m laughing at Wilfred
Acting bigger than a master wizard
Gall bladders and gizzards
Scroll patterns and scriptures
In this lost land of the lizards
Take a tall stand
Y’all abandoned the blizzard
Bathroom stall call backs
Blasted in sizzurup
Mall santas and pictures with slut sisters
Young digg-a-ler
Tongue tick-a-ler
Turning love interests to cum switchers
Rub with her ‘til my thumb blisters
Drunk hipster with the bum ticker
Fucked liver
Drug sniffer
Chug liqueur with one hitters ‘til my head hurts
Tell Earl Sweatshirt I’m talking on a blog with my arms cut off it’s fucking awesome dawg
Pay to watch us say obnoxious slang at concerts
Our tapes bonkers
My CD’s nuts
Drawings of me on the cover like see deez nutz
I’m cd as fuck
I’m better than everybody-what!
Pills on my necklace, pump up the Valium
I’m a punk in drublic like a NOFX album
Killed so many kids my cortex can’t count ‘em
Drive a corvette through a cortex
And warning, warhead, smiling
I’m recording important findings and filing ‘em  in the name of science as if my name was

Carl Sagan
A million digits
You feel me?
That’s metaphysics
If I ever die, remember me for freestyling
And if I ever ride, I’m in that front side smiling
If I ever die, remember that man was a mountain
Living like an island
Thinking like he’s Carl Sagan
A million digits
You feel me?
That’s astrophysics
Carl Sagan

[Verse 2]
These are love letters to loneliness
Lazy ass
Lollygag
Trying lie to you on a polygraph
With two girlfriends a poly-amorous Dalai Lama Jeffrey Dahmer swag
And you don’t want the problems that my problems have
Whooping stacks of Marley and monopoly cash
I’m proudly watching battles yelling “Body Bag!”
Went from pottery to pot now I pop up in your podcasts
Sorry Mom, Sorry Dad but I forgot my past blacked out at the party signing autographs in an Obama mask
I’m doing ollies off a dropping ramp
You’re an Aziz Ansari rant
Some sort of comedy act
I’m Ali in a boxing match
I’ll leave your arteries collapsed heartbeat flat as Atari pads
Kicking the shit out of a printer with the guys from Office Space while I’m
Screaming in my boss’ face like
Do you copy that?!
