Go down to the club, get some so-and-so
Drop it low, now I'm going rogue
Catch me down by the clinic, I ride alone
With lots of dough, getting more and more
I'm rolling cold in my Polo drawers
Used to call us reggie, now we're going dro
Tonight I go for broke, I'm about to dome and done
Ride around and get it like I'm Tity-Boi, no kidding
We don't accept no pity, riding 'round the whip is nifty
Like some onomonopea, Gucci watch up on my wrist
Sitting on the curb in public dome and doning with your bitch
Like oh! They see me on the TV
GPC arrested cause his swagger is a billi
You people are silly, you steady want to be me
Hit me up on Super Smash, I'll beat you in the melee

Dome and done

Gone off that juice, even when I'm rapping
Methadone, real shit, tell me that's what's happening
I got more dome than the Sistine Chapel
Michaelangelo told me I'm his favorite rapper
Miami Art Basel, won the whole thing
I dome and done, call it a performance piece
Me and my friends, we all want to D and D
Eat a BLT and none of y'all are seeing me
At the DMV, permit test again
Fail it every week, back to busing it
Back to the clinic, I'mma get some D
I'mma get it going now, just doing me
This is Glass Popcorn 2013
Take you twelve listens to understand the meaning (probably)

On the government pills, I'm loving this shit
Kids gonna get it to this song in their cribs, it's a hit
I'll shoot a video and hit a billion
Dance craze
