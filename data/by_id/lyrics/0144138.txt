Sometimes we're insecure
We're fragile sometimes
We laugh at each other
To make ourselves feel better
Sometimes we lie
Sometimes we say things
That we really don't mean
But in the moment
Seem like the thing to do

[Chorus]
We're all flawed beautiful people
We're all flawed beautiful creatures
We're all flawed beautiful people
We're all flawed beautiful creatures

[Verse 2: Stacy Barthe]
Is it a crime if a man kills
To protect his own from harm's way?
Who are we to judge anyway?
What would you have done
If the gun was in your hands
Your feet were in his shoes?
Guess you’ll never know what you won’t do
Cause in the moment
Might seem like the thing to do
You might also like[Chorus]
We're all flawed beautiful people
We're all flawed beautiful creatures
We're all flawed beautiful people
We're all flawed beautiful creatures

[Bridge]
Sometimes
We gotta lose it to find it
We gotta lose sometimes
We win
We live then why we gotta die?
Oh why, why?

[Chorus]
We're all flawed beautiful people
We're all flawed beautiful creatures
We're all flawed beautiful people
We're all flawed beautiful creatures
