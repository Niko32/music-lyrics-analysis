Never one to be held back or held down
I'd write my name so the king, he could see
I will follow the true declaration
And find some hope in what mankind could be

[Verse 2]
I've worked so hard
Let my deeds be my witness
And let my words flow through everyone
When free men stand
Against what would bind them
No hope for tyrants
We will overcome

[Chorus]
Do not, do not
Do not obey! (No masters now!)
Do not, do not
Do not obey (Not subjects!)
We have held on for so long (held on for so long!)
Do not, do not
Do not obey

[Verse 3]
Talking heads tell the masses the story
They shape the lie in the schools and TV
Our fathers work and intent is unwritten
By the lazy who don't know they're free
You might also like[Verse 4]
I hear the story and it makes me determined
To spread the word that we can't just lay down
What we read and we see drawn before us
Is a lie and we must hold our ground

[Chorus]
Do not, do not
Do not obey! (No masters now!)
Do not, do not
Do not obey (Not subjects!)
We have held on for so long (held on for so long!)
Do not, do not
Do not obey

[Bridge]
I am
Not a subject!

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Do not, do not
Do not obey! (No masters now!)
Do not, do not
Do not obey (Not subjects!)
We have held on for so long (held on for so long!)
Do not, do not
Do not obey
[Outro]
It's found in you
It's found in me
From birth to stone
We remain free as always
Always
