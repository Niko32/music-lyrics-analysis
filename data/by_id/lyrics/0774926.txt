Oh, I was perfect for the circus
If he dared me, I'd do it
Love makes you stupid
I'd give it up, but I guess it was not enough
'Cause he never seemed satisfied

[Chorus]
I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day, who is?
He wanted someone that's perfect
Well, okay, but can you tell me who is?

[Verse 2]
He set the bar
Just above the stars
A rocket couldn't reach it
But I still kept on reaching
He watched me try at least a thousand times
If he loved me, he'd stop me, but no

[Chorus]
I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day, who is?
He wanted someone that's perfect
Well, okay, but can you tell me who is?
You might also like[Bridge]
I saw my future in his eyes
So wrong, so wrong
Guess I was destined for more in my life
'Cause he didn't break me down, he made me strong

[Chorus]
I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day, who is?
He wanted someone that's perfect
Well, okay, but can you tell me who is?
