The angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
Oh, in fields where they lay
They lay keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so very bleak

Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel

As we celebrate the birthday of our Lord
I won't let the true meaning be ignored
He came to give his life
For you and I

This is the time of year
To spread a little joy and cheer
Remembering the newborn King
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, sing
From the heaven up he fell
