I wish I could tell you, but the words would come out wrong
Oh, if you only knew the way I felt for so long
I know that we're worlds apart, but I just don't seem to care
These feelings in my heart, only with you I wanna share

[Chorus]
The first time I caught
A glimpse of you
Then all my thoughts
Were only of you

[Verse 2]
I hope that when time goes by, you will think the same about me
Many nights awake I lie, I only wish that you could see
I know that we're only friends, I hope this feeling never ends
If I could only hold you, it's the only thing I wanna do

[Chorus]
The first time I caught
A glimpse of you
Then all my thoughts
Were only of youYou might also like
