Through the smoke of the room
My dark and delicate creature

The sensuous way that your hair
Curves round the cusp of your ear
Is something complicated
So complicated for me

Here in your room I have learned to be tender
It's too much to take in
To study and try to remember

The shape that make in your dress
The colour and taste of your breasts
Is something complicated
Too complicated for me

Intimacy never came easy for me
I so longed to be close
But it never came easy to me
I'm ashamed to undress if I know you are watching me
I could never express these contradictions that complicate meYou might also like
