I'm gettin' ready(ready),I'm gettin' ready(ready)
I'm gettin' ready(ready),I'm gettin' ready(ready)

One morning I had a dream
I could make a young lady scream
By makin' musical sounds with my mounth(listen)
So I tried it at a party
And people didn't know it was me
And when they finally saw me I heard a shout(like that)
To see a crownd just dazed and amazed
And everybody's eyes just gazed upon the man we know as
DOUG E. F-R-E-S-H
And to prove to you and the crew
Who I am and what I do
Now is it because I know how to kiss
And the ladies can't resist
Plus they love it when I go like
When I go like
Go,go,go like
When I go
When I,When I go like
When I go like this cause

(CHORUS)
You might also likeNow every,every,every,every,every rhyme
I made is no mistake
And I'm giving you more and you can be sure then you can take
In the projects,buildings,tenements,palaces,you work hard
You bound to get callouses on your hand
Every woman and man an I'm givin' you more than you can stand
I'm ready and willin'
Cold Chillin'
Gettin' paid wearing silks and suede
Go to Barbados and cool in the shade
Do my exercise,keep nice and trim
Go down to the beach for a real cool swim
And all the ladies say let's talk to him
He,he let's talk to him
I got brown hair and a brown complexion
Keep my hair up to perfection
Believe in the saying you are what you eat
That's the main reason why I don't eat meat
But I can say a fresh rhyme off a fresh beat
And like,and like,and like,and like I'm on the mike
And like I'm on the mike
And like Adam and Eve we're gonna try a achieve
What most people out here disbelieve
Dj's cuts so hard that it's hard to breathe
Make the best Dj's in the place want to leave
Chill Will,Barry Bee where you goin'
Y'all out of here
Yeah well
(chorus)

Break it down......
Nah,nah,nah,nah,nah
Oh,oh,oh,oh
(repeat 3 times)

(chorus)

Because it's everlasting,broadcasting
I don't eat meat cause right now I'm fasting
Secure and safe and oh,my god doin so damn good
When times are hard and loved through every continent
Have statues,streets an a monument
Have a statue
Looking right at you
And have streets named after hip-hop beats
Let MC's know that bitin from me the crew is G-F-C
