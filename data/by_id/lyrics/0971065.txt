Good looking but you're out of place
There's only one-way left
We'll take the models but we'll leave the rest
Straighten your face
Quicken your pace
I wouldn't sell my soul
Those shoes you're wearing make your face look old
They come in cherry red
You wear them cheeky like your mama did
Straighten your face
Quicken your pace
Exotica
We're chasing all those pretty lies
Live the good in life in Exotica
But is that who you are?
Exotica
A world where dreams can come alive
When you're deep inside Exotica
But is it you?
She said she'll live forever in a fashion spread
She's on the cover of the magazines her daddy read
Straighten your face
Quicken your pace
Exotica
We're chasing all those pretty lies
Live the good in life in Exotica
But is that who you are?
Exotica
A world where dreams can come alive
When you're deep inside Exotica
But is it you?
No i ain’t gonna wait in line
Holding my hands at the side
Look right
It's all gonna happen tonight
Ooo burn my eyes and scratch my face and kick me under ground
But do you remember, I remember
Exotica
We're chasing all those pretty lies
Live the good in life in Exotica
But now I’m home, now I’m home
Exotica
A world where dreams can come alive
When you're deep inside Exotica
Oh, now I’m home
Exotica, Exotica, now I’m home
Exotica, ExoticaYou might also like
