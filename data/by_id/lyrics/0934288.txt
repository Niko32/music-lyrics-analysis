I can still remember
The last time I saw your face
I kept calling your name
You just ran the other way
What the hell's your problem?
You talk a lot of smack
Spreading little rumors
And talking behind my back

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows!

[Chorus]
You're just a little brat
You're living off your daddy's money
You talk like you're all that
Little rich girl, go back home
You brag and brag and brag
Take your head out of your ass
Because nobody here cares
About anything you say

[Verse 2]
Now you're dating my ex
And you think that I am upset
Just remember one thing
I dumped him when he was a mess
Whenever you kiss him
Can't you taste me inside his mouth?
Do yourself a favor
And move on with your life right now
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody knows, everybody knows
Everybody knows, everybody knows!

[Chorus]
You're just a little brat
You're living off your daddy's money
You talk like you're all that
Little rich girl, go back home
You brag and brag and brag
Take your head out of your ass
Because nobody here cares
About anything you say
