Invaders came to tear this land apart
But they wouldn't sacrifice, oh no
They couldn't win my heart
As the morning star rises like a firefly
I stand on Cactus Rock alone
For this is the last time

Backing off the victory roll
I'm not spoiling for a fight
Wear the turquoise mask tonight
Like a thunderclap
The ugly ones attack
There's no turning back
So go Blue Hummingbird

Oh no, not another megalomaniac

Fettered and chained while smoky eagles rise
And the winds four directions will blow
But not erase them from our minds
And the crumpled feathers on this broken wing
Cannot impair our flight oh no
Burning spirits sing
You might also likeHelp my tormented soul to rest
This is not my time nor place
Give the turquoise mask a face
Like a thunderclap
The ugly ones attack
There's no turning back
So go Blue Hummingbird

Oh no, not another megalomaniac
