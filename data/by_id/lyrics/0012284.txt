You rang
Is you jokin'G? A beat from Mike Mosley?
Papers, bangin' and homicide
The quicker the trigger the quicker the caper
Fools be bumpin' they gums
But they constantly care to the vapors
In this life it ain't nothing that can save ya
We're working overtime, nigga
Some motherfucking hard labor (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Kastro]
They got my dick in the dust, dirty
Bust me, they must be dreamin'
Trust me these cowards heard a murder
And they ain't tryin' to see it
Nigga I done been there
When I was too young to be
So now I'm comatose, shell shocked and barely breathin'
But still I respect the game
Test me, you ain't too sane
Outlaw like Josey Wales
Too touched to try to take
C-Bo, they think we changed, no
We just lost hope
Ready for war plus we deadly like some

(Bad dope)I remember when one of my teachers told me
That I ain't shit, and ain't gon' never be shit
Look at me now bitch, influencin' kids with this
Now we're rainin' on our enemies
Hennessy got me critically
Fillin' these, instantly
Knew the plan and what my mission be
Sent to me from Makaveli the general
Military mind, outlaw we kill 'em slow
Critical condition for that ho, C-Bo
It's hard labor, knowin' this rap shit might save us
Not from death, but from the capers

[Chorus: Napoleon, Young Noble, Both]
Nigga, all we do is act a fool and stay thugged out (Thugged out)
And the first nigga that act up is gettin' drugged out
Chasing paper, it's hard labor
Major figures prayin' that it could save us (Save us)
Cops hatred, judges is racist, they can't break us
Nigga, all we do is act a fool and stay thugged out (Thugged out)
And the first nigga that act up is gettin' drugged out
Chasing paper, it's hard labor
Major figures prayin' that it could save us (Save us)
Cops hatred, judges is racist, they can't break us
Hard labor
[Verse 3: Storm]
Got' em in thug warriors
Runnin' through my veins
As story's told my game's insane
Fuck the world get your money man, play the game
Got stuck where's your heartbeat? Who's to blame?
Waging all out war, if you're bad you draw
Got a vision of our enemies hittin' the floor
For Makaveli for my Outlawz I blast 'em all
Keep your mind on more riches, while I even the score
First nigga where you at, speak, friend or fo'
Got a 9-G locked, if you slip you fall
Shoot first, last layin' no peace or fame
I die for this shit nigga, hard labor

[Verse 4: Kastro]
They got my block hot
These cops wanna put a stop to my plot
They locked my bitch up
And even tried to lock in my pops
It's hard labor, my mind too crimey, thinkin' too major
Mad, cause, nowadays too many ho's is on my pager
Pussy and paper
Pistol politics embrace you
Chase you and even chase me
Straight to the penitentiary
Nigga, it's a hard life, hard fight and hard capers
Nigga, we're hard thugs, overdosin' hard labor
[Interlude: Big Lurch]
Walked up in the club and seen a nigga drugged to the flo'
Looked up and seen my nigga big C-Bo

[Verse 5: C-Bo]
Check I was born into this life of sin, as a young thug
Releasin' stress over pint of gin, laced with bud
From day one I knew is wasn't no motherfuckin' love
They use to chunk 'em with hands and now they chunkin' them with slugs
I was confused first to see a church
On this hell on earth
But it was them fools first that took earth
For what it was worth
I was raised in this crazed community
Where there was no unity
And niggas be on they own
As soon as they reached puberty
Be you and me front and back, in a Cadillac
Fresh off a jack, with two straps in a Pontiac
With only one life to live
I guess the Lord had only one life to give
It seems so trifling, born in hell
Been prayered for your life of sin
It's hell on earth, ain't nothin' worse
Than givin' birth to a kid
Taught to sin until he's buried to dirt
It's been a thug life since day one
When I was strugglin'
25 Years later got rich, thuggin' hard labor
