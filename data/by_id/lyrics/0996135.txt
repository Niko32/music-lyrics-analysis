I should have known better
Coming around here talking about all your heavy friends
How you been everywhere and back again
Telling me that I'm much too rough
Treating me like I ain't good enough for you
She's so French

I know she's a bad thing
I know I should turn and walk away
Instead of wasting my time
With any girl who thinks she's
Some kind of 'Queen for a day'
But like the fool that I am
I never get too far before I'm back again
She's so French

She's so French
And she does that thing that makes men crazy
She's so French

And she does that thing that makes men crazy

Ohh, she'll make you glad you were born a man
Ohh, you'd better say no if you can
'Cause she'll get you in the end

And there are things a young man needs
Some women got a way with words
Others play with your heart til it bleeds, but not her
She's so one of a kind
She'll hurt your body and you won't even mind
She's so French

She's so French
And she does that thing that makes men crazy
She's so French
And she does that thing that makes men crazy
