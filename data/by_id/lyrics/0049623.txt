[Verse 1: Prez]
Uh
I'm poppin' bottles of prescribed medication for players
I'm pushin' pills and painkillers to relieve this frustration
Makin' millions off of rap is not a negotiation
Hundreds of rappers done it, got famous, that's my motivation
Runners, corner posters, pill fiends, and drug promoters
I run this orchestration, you can call Prez the composer
Wake up in Vegas, but I didn't star in "The Hangover"
Chillin' on the corner brought me plenty of dough, like Homer
I got mountains of that grain, but ain't talkin' granola
My doja quota is over, ain't dealin' Coca-Cola
Smokin' bowls wit my bros, but naw we ain't the Jonas
Hocus pocus, Devil's grass leaves me bold and soulless
If you approached me like a hostess, and I seemed to notice
I would probably cook you like some wings at Friday's, leave you boneless
My business is vicious, and good luck if you witness
Smokin' juicy fruit citrus, light you up like Christmas (OK then)

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Prez]
When that car pull up wit tinted windows, I feel some doubt
Like maybe if I slide into that backseat, I won't come back out
I call these customers locusts, they leave me dry like droughts
But don't stress nothin', you know I get weight in like a boxing bout
You know I'm here to fuck shit up, I got some cruel intentions
Get high  every day, I think I need a intervention
Oh, you depressed? Well here, take this for all your imperfections
I run my neighborhood like I picked off a interception
Got more ups and downs in this backpack than a elevator
I run these white lines in the street, like I'm a tennis player
Let me educate you, my dudes packin' like Texas Ranger
These chambers releasin' lasers that cut you down like razors
Sellin' White Widow, Sour Diesel, this marijuana
Attempted robberies end in Kurt Cobain, that's no nirvana
Leave your brains and your body layin' in terra-cotta
These boys is screamin' for they mamas, fuckin' prima donnas (OK then)
