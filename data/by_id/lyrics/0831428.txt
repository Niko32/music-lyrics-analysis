In spite of these creations
A venom settles in the blood
With fangs that will not rest til they've engulfed
Everything, the sky and humans all alike
Dispersing vile scripture as abundant as the night
This poison takes but a single drop to thrive
The vipers waltz in time to slay the conscience back to blind
Slowly digesting and conspiring with mortal threads
This evil's woven firm its lies into our heads
A single cry will silence all
But a single pierce will bring to fall
Despite all odds we must confront
What our deepest fears have presented us
You've got the truth before you
And yet your eyes are shut
How can you speak
When the serpent's got your tongue?
This clarity can't be denied but before us stands the initial face of phases
Our fears will flee, our strength will hide
Open your eyes. Open your eyes
The serpent goes by many names and wears many a disguise
Open your eyes or let this poison slowly seep and consume you whole
Don't let the serpent catch your tongue and drown your soul
(Open your eyes) This blindness is an ailment
Incurable by any means
But tearing the seams from the eyes
To bow down to the King of all mankind
Behold untainted sight
The truth is inscribed in the veins under the eyes
Release from the clutch of the serpentine
To behold untainted sight
You've got the truth before you
And yet your eyes are shut
How can you speak
When the serpent's got your tongue?
