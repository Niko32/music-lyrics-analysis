High hopes, keep my eyes low
In my zone like a 2-3, you try to take me out, I call an iso
Young legend, that's Michael
Lace my Jordan's up, see death where I go
And that's frightful
Life on the tightrope
I fear the things I see when my eyes close
Cause my mommas death been fucking with me, all my old friends want a handout
Thinking since we go way back they'll use my route like that's planned out
Guess my future's looking brighter now besides my opinionized life and doubt
But if you ain't writing these songs than what the fuck can you opinionize about?
These flashing lights seem like the perfect cure when your life and heart reside in dark
And never speak so my mind and art simply reflect the pain when I'm in thought
Been getting at em like Eve's, nigga
Rapping like Christmas Eve, nigga
Rappers claim that they're fucking with me but ain't getting at me
Subtweet nigga

[Verse 2: Benjamin Scott]
Are you willing to give up what you love for who you love?
To chase the lights and lose your girlfriend or groupie love
Or risk your life tryna be the greats and consume their buzz just to look back and say that that's the life that you used to love?
Shit, there ain't no way I'm coming up short
Cause all the shit I'm risking could be all the things I stood for
Won't stop til the finest weeds in my ashtray
And i'm the president of my campaign
And the whole world know my damn name

Aspire to inspire before I expire
Cause my expiration date, seems to just be great
-Er than me and my past desires
Been question life since Sha got killed
How do I manage to pick up the pen still?
How do I answer things I really fear?
Like if the good die young I can't question why I'm still here
Huhh?
Just a day in the life, you can call me crazy, you can call me odd
Born in '96 with a hex, that triple six
I drown in sin, that's why I'm scared to call on God
But through the pain, stife
All the soul issue that helped me gain sight
Everything I write only shows that I've
Been chasing street lights my whole damn life
