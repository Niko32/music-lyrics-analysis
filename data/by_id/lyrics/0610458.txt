Classroom Majors is Lamar Kash, Noez Newton & Astro Jetsun. The 3 brothers were born in Nashville, Tennessee. Growing up in a single mother household, music always provided a voice to the brothers where no one else could. Classroom Majors main influences were R&B and Gospel music. They fell in love with the sound and it continues to shape their musical artistry today. In 1999 they moved to Atlanta, Georgia. While living there they continued to expand their love of music and eventually were introduced to the sound and expression synonymous with Hip Hop music. All 3 of the talented brothers played integral roles in other music groups. It was only a matter of time before they realized that due to similar styles and vision they should form their own trio. In 2010 Classroom Majors was born to inspire, motivate, encourage and satisfy their listeners in a major way. As co-CEOs of BodyShock Productions, a business specializing in graphic art design, audio engineering, photography and videography, Kash, Noez and Astro have been solidifying themselves as part of the Hip Hop community. Today, the Hip Hop/R&B group is poised to become great with a unique sound and a profound message
