There's hope you know
There's always something here for you

It makes me feel strange
To see you again
I feel happy when I see your face

I think that I know
Where I should go

Cos I know that I'm
Gonna find something this time
Cos I just made up my mind

I think that I know
Where I should go
I'm feeling fine because I know
Yeah I know that I'm
Gonna find some peace this time
Yeah I feel my luck could shine . . You might also like
