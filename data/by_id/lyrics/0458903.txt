(Verse 1: LooneyY)
I'm going polygamous
Always on my threes
Girl kinda holy
Always on her knees
Praying for me, delivering, servicing, yeah the head and em
Real perfect but it ain't worth it when
A nigga like me is flirting n'
Cheating n'
Hitting round like a home run
Doing wrong and feeling free like a loose thong
Shit spiteful, she suicidal
Cause she loves me but don't want me
While i fuck her
Claim lover
But to that lady she's a roomie damn
She's done
She's gone
Now a nigga cracking laughing saying she gon come
But it ain't true
Yeah nigga look at you
Fake nigga yeah you lost
Maybe cause you a code breaker
Maybe cause you a heart breaker
Maybe i'm a no brainer
Sound of music when i hear my baby laugh
Super kinda fragile elastic girl
I missed the bell
Someone save me well
Or i hit the hell
For my soul to sell
I hate love but i lust for love
On the plus side my life is solved cause
You might also like(Chorus)
I am done
Smoking good
We lost it all
The love is gone
I am done
Smoking good
We lost it all
The love is gone

(Verse 2: Odis)
Couple things i gotta change and you top on the list
Imma use this song to vent
And hopefully put a tick next to your name
Tired of the BS and the mind games
The mine games, you can have it all except my last name
Fuck you and your bitches
That's what ama do
Ama fuck em never trust em cause there's nothing else to do
Only ride with a nigga on the fast lane
So ama only ride with a bitch if she really got that ass mayne
The break up sex, the make up sex
The good times with no latex, No breaks sex, we had it all
I smoke a doobie tryna come up with a melody
But you keep popping up like
Eyy, you remember me?
Now i'm faded tryna get laid but you whispering in my ear
Like the devil on my shoulder reminding me that you ain't here
Saying, you ain't shit, you ain't half the man you used to be
You ain't shit, cause you ain't shit without me
(Chorus)

(Outro)
Odis: Swear down fuck all these bitches mehn
LooneyY: Naa mehn i love that girl mehn
I'm sad she left me
Maybe it's because my dick is too small
I don't even know
Odis: Ma dick
LooneyY: Oh shit, Alaga Ibile Tungsten on the beat
Odis: These bitches be tripping!
Vennymeck: Real nigga shit! Real nigga shit!
LooneyY: Oh shit, oh fuck. I need her back, i need her back, i need her back
Odis: I'm fucking done
