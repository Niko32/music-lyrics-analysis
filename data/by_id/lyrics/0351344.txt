Pass The Strap Right Here
My Intention's Lethal
Now You Wanna Talk Peace? (Awww Pobresito)
Too Late For That
Cuz I'm Blacking Out
And You Know The Streets Talk
I'm Track You Down
With My Crimey Fiest
Got You Vatos Scared
Telling All Your Little Homies
That We Ain't All There
And I Know You See Us
Cuz We Passing By
House Hiding Little Bitch
Peeking Out Your Blinds
With The 45 You Can Say I'm Fatal
Put A Hole In Your Head
Like A Fucking Bagel
I'm A Fool
When It Comes To This Banging Shit
Even Moms Will Let You Know
That Her Son Is Sick
And I Had A Choice
Got Myself To Blame
From The "P"
But I Staying Tossing Up An "H" (Hurleys Block)
So You Better Be Strapped
It's A Must These Days

What If I
Sound The Trumpets Of War?
Would You Try To Get Away From It All?
You Can't Get Away (Can't Away)
What If I
Sound The Trumpets Of War?
Would You Try To Get Away From It All?
You Can't Get Away (Can't Away)

[Verse 2: Fiesty 2 Guns]
Growing Up To Be A Soldier
In The Land Of The Lost
I Hear The Trumpets Of War
When I Sacrifice Through The Gauntlet
Should I Bare The Mark?
For All The Sins That I Caused
I Ran The Hood Up On My Flesh
For Every Soul That Was Lost
As I'm Clenching My Weapon
I Feel The Power Within
Once Again It's Revenge
For Another Lost Friend
My Enemies On The Path
They're Coming Back For My Life
Lil Youngster From His Gang
Trying To Stack Up His Strife
I Keep Connected To Garden
Where The Wild Flores Reign
I Keep My Ears To The Streets
Encase My Name Said In Vein
Remenissions On My Missions
Contemplating My Actions
Satisfactions And Reactions
Till These Last Men Are Standing
And I'm Embracing My Hood
Wear My Honor And Pride
Until I'm Judging They
In Around My Demise
An Eye For An Eye
That's What I Was Taught
And As The Casket Being Buried
They're Digging Up Another Plot

[Verse 3: Fiesty 2 Guns]
Every Time You See A Bridge
You Always See Flowers
On Monte Flores & Puente
We Be Devouring Cowards
And When They're Looking For Fights
Best Believe You'll Find Trouble
Twin Powers In The Valle
Making Enemies Crumble
I'm From The Land
Where The Gutter Be In The Big SGV
You See The Bird In The Sky
Investigating The Scene
There Ain't No Room For No Fear
It's Disappearing Inside
It's By The Codes Of The Street
And Only The Strong Survive

[Verse 4: Troub Nasty]
Well Sound The Trumpets Of war
But We Ain't Talking Bout Horns
Hit Your Block
Pistols Pop
Make You Drop To The Floor
Annihilated My Foes
These Hot Hollows Explode
On Contact Ripping Flesh
And Ricochet Off The Bongs
16 In The 6
And We Smashing Between
Chalk Dust In The Calles
Sheriff Tape Off The Scene
Charlie Row Camponeros Homie
Somos Matones
From Varrio Puente Trece Rifamos To Flores
