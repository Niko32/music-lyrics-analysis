Hello
[Yoni Wolf]
Hello?
[Jimmy Breeze]
Hey, what's up?
[Yoni Wolf]
Is this Jimmy Breeze?
[Jimmy Breeze]
Yeah
[Yoni Wolf]
Yeah well, we're looking for a rhythm guitar player for our band
[Jimmy Breeze]
OK, OK, sounds good
[Yoni Wolf]
What do you look like? Do you look good holding a guitar?
[Jimmy Breeze]
Oh yeah, yeah
[Josiah Wolf]
We have specific suits. We wear leather pants and, uh, a red and black Michael Jackson suede jacket
[Jimmy Breeze]
Um, no, I don't got a problem with that, man

I've taught myself to survive a four story fall
Wearing a space suit and a dead Englishman's socks
It's a textbook procedure, kid
Right out of the pages of the hollowed out book
Where once I hid my paint speckled glasses
Don't lose your shoes over such a simple step as hitting ground
Just remember to roll
Just remember to roll
Silence in a five-story stairwell
I say, and that's all I can think of
In my brandon-eyed dead of day drawl
I can barely squeeze that lie
Through the plaque-clogged pinhole between my two front teeth

Mom
I've kept a razor under my tongue since I was a small toddler with a tight belt
I haven't been able to kiss a woman with an open mouth, my friend
Cause I'm afraid that I'd split her lip
Is that sick?

[Jimmy Breeze]
Well, my friend lives down on the eastern side of Cincinnati

[Why?]

The man with the negative wingspan
Eats sourdough sue bread
And hits his highest notes on tippietoe
It's simple introspection
When the sun is silent
And the fluorescents with their blue
Make the plants call you
A lonely monkey
In a very large glass cage
It's simple introspection
When the sun is silent
And the fluorescents with their blue
Make the plants call you
A lonely monkey
In a very large glass cage
