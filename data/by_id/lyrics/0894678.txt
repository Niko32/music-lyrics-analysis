Gently betrayed with a kiss
And all my dreams com tumbling down
What i've found
Well i was
Lost
Without you i was
Lost
Without a trace
Lost
Never to be found

I cried and turned up the radio
So no one would hear i was down
So no one knew the trouble i had
Yeah i had it bad
Well i was
Lost
Without you i was
Lost
Without a trace
Lost
You know that i was
Lost
Without you i was
Lost
Loosing faith, i was
Lost
Never to be found

The way that i was
Lost
Without a trace

Tell you i was
Lost
Without you i was
Lost
Loosing faith
Lost
Never to be found
No never to be found
Sure that i was
Lost
Forever to be
Forever to be
Well i was
