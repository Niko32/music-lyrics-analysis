Oh oh, yeah

I've got it all, but I feel so deprived
I go up, I come down and I'm emptier inside
Tell me what is this thing that I feel like I'm missing?
And why can't I let it go?

There's gotta be more to life than chasing down
Every temporary, high to satisfy me
'Coz the more that I'm
Tripping out thinking there must be more of life
Where there's life, but I'm sure there's gotta be more
Than wanting more

I've got the time and I'm wasting it slowly
Here in this moment, I'm half way out the door
Onto the next thing, I'm searching
For something that's missing

There's gotta be more to life than chasing down
Every temporary, high to satisfy me
'Coz the more that I'm
Tripping out thinking there must be more of life
Where there's life, but I'm sure there's gotta be more
You might also likeI'm wanting more
I'm always waiting on something other than this
Why am I feelin' like there's
Something I missed? Yeah

There's gotta be more to life than chasing down
Every temporary, high to satisfy me
'Coz the more that I'm
Tripping out thinking there must be more of life
Where there's life, but I'm sure

There's gotta be more to life than chasing down
Every temporary, high to satisfy me
'Coz the more that I'm
Tripping out thinking there must be more of life
Where there's life, but I'm sure

There's gotta be much to life, yeah
More to, more to, more to life yeah, there's gotta be much to life
More to, more to, more to life, there's gotta be much to life
