His good looks, the latter for her extraordinary ugliness. While
They were playing one day as children, they happened by chance to
Look together into a mirror that was placed on their mother's
Chair. The boy congratulated himself on his good looks; the girl
Grew angry, and could not bear the self-praises of her Brother,
Interpreting all he said (and how could she do otherwise?) into
Reflection on herself. She ran off to her father. to be avenged
On her Brother, and spitefully accused him of having, as a boy,
Made use of that which belonged only to girls. The father
Embraced them both, and bestowing his kisses and affection
Impartially on each, said, "I wish you both would look into the
Mirror every day: you, my son, that you may not spoil your beauty
By evil conduct; and you, my daughter, that you may make up for
Your lack of beauty by your virtues."
