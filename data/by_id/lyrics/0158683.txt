Uhh, look, look

[Verse 1: Mike Millennium]
I said, money on my mind, snapback on my head
I be on my grind I'm just tryna stack this bread
Do this for my moms, do this for my dad
Man my barz so crazy I'mma need to take some meds
I said I'm from the 215, rep that til I'm dead
I be making money while you laying in the bed
Yeah i hustle hard, I'm tryna get ahead
And my flow is so retarded it belongs in special ed
Man I'm headed to the to, I be getting to the guap
Do it til the day I die, I ain't never gonna stop
And you know I'm gonna pop, like a wheelie,cuz I'm illy
Man for really, don't be silly, I'm from Philly, and im really
Tryna' make about a milli, man I'm all about a benji
And I got my homies with me, and you know they're rollin' with me, yeah
I said I put on for my city
And I'm tryna' get this paper like an old head in his sixty's, yeah
My pockets get hungry so I gotta feed em
Can't join my competition so I gotta beat em
I'm facing all and still standing tall like the Colosseum
Middle finger to my haters man that's how I treat em
I need this bread so I gotta stay up
Getting money til I fall asleep and never wake up
I'm tryna get a pay check, and not a pay cut
Because I'm tryna stay fresh, and get my cake up, uhh
So I'mma go hard, harder than a porn star
And I'mma shine brighter than the Lone Star
I'm tryna buy my own crib, own clothes, own car
If my manz in trouble I'mma ride like a go kart
Swagga so mean, in my bag I'm so clean
I need more cash, more bread, more green
I'ma get this cream and rep my city til I die
And I'm all about my team, that's me, myself, and I
