And you leave me powerless
And what if the world shook after you stepped out
I'm sure i'd surely lose it
And sometimes i need you
When i know i shouldn't
And i'd like to think i could solve myself
But i know i couldn't

Sometimes i need a little rock n' roll
But i don't want to dress it up
I just want it wrapping all around my senses
Shutting them off the from this fashion show
And sometimes i need you
When i know i shouldn't
And i'd like to think i could solve myself
But i know i couldn'tYou might also like
