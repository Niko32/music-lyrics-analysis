I got an old guitar, I got me some licks I've been piddling with
I'm gonna write a song, I got me some words I've been fiddling with

My guitar don't look like much but I love the way it plays
My guitar don't look like much ya'll but I love the way it plays
I know I ain't good looking my woman loves me anyway

Give a boy a guitar he's going to play until his fingers bleed
Give a boy a guitar he's going to play until his fingers bleed
Got to raise him up right on Muddy, Lighting, Hooker and Reed
