What I cry for - what I choose to show
Of myself and how I'd like to keep
The wolf inside me - finally asleep
You are just a tree in my garden
Well, I'm the one who is looking for a friend
Way down to "Little Low" now
Way down to "Little Low"
I am way down to "Little Low" now
Way down to "Little Low"
So one day it's knocking on my door
Be careful now, it's slippery - the floor
I wax it now and then, it makes me feel
Better all the time - let's spin the wheel
Way down a different line
Way down now
Hey down to a different world this time
Way down to a different kind of lowYou might also like
