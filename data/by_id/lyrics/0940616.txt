It's just a processional. It's not a confessional. The meaning is gone I knew it all along

Sifting through the debris. How did I know?
Set those dead letters free. Should have never gone

You thought I was on a roll. React to the chemicals
You've got a wish that's made of solid gold
I'm licking the floor for crumbs. A piece of what I've become
Now all my fingers are completely numb
