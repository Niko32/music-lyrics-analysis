Ever since I was a kid I thought that my life was fine
With what I’ve had, and what I had was me, myself and mine
Since no one else even bothered to try to mess with me
And links and bonds were made which is one huge blessing for them, but me?
I sat in the corner while everybody was hanging out
Since all they did was shut me down every time I opened my mouth
And now that I am older, I’ve gotten over my cold shoulder
And started to make friendships I thought would grow bolder
And they did grow bold, but not the bold that I expected
The more I had them, there were more troubles that I accepted
I thought “Friendships shouldn’t be like this – this really is quite odd”
And I thought my campaign about friendship is just a façade
Now I’m lying in my bed really late at night thinking all about what happened that would cause my strife
I had never felt like this when I had no life, or did I have one? Just the solo kind
And words can’t ever explain how much I’ve been wanting to revert
I just want it back to normal with no pain or hurt, so

[Hook]
When we part ways, think of me as nothing but a memory
And forget about me the moment I leave your mind
I’ve no intention on letting you see the end of me
Because who I am will be nothing of the kind
I’ve no intention on letting you see the old me either
There’d be too much pain for me to take away
I’m sitting here with no time and no trace of ether
So do me a favor and let me fade away
Let me fade away, fade away

This face you’ve come to know is not the actual face that I possess
I’m not what you’ve seen me as – this is a mask and cloaking dress
It’s the Mr. Roboto to my Kilroy – domo arigato
Styx and stones may break these bones, whether these bones are real, I don’t know
And if you ever saw what’s underneath this mess, I pray to God
That you drop any connection you have with me and run hard
Because what’s revealed would make us ache with no relief
I’m a creature, I’m a thing, I’m a monster, I’m a Cie’th
The sad thing about all this is that I chose to be this way
The isolation and this trouble that I have today
Could all have been avoided, prevented like a forest fire
But I dabble in these flames with some lingering desire
Is my lingering desire to leave myself and my surroundings hurtin’?
Is it to mess the circle of life to the point where life is never worth it?
I’m an empty vessel – for anyone to control
And I can’t do this anymore – I’ve got to let this go, so

[Hook]

[Outro]
Let me fade away, fade away
So do me a favor and let me fade away
Let me fade away, fade away
Let me fade away, fade away
So do me a favor and let me fade away
Let me fade away, fade away...
