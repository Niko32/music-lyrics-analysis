Snapbacks back (Yeah), snapbacks back (Ha)
That's all these niggas sayin' (Ha, ha), I brought snapbacks back (Haha)
I'm a fresh ass nigga, bitches know I'm the shit
Twenty-five for my belt, nigga, get off my dick (Hermès, nigga)

I brought the snapback back (Back), snapback back (Back)
Man, all these niggas foul like Hack-a-Shaq (Shaq)
Nigga, racks on racks, my bitch ass so fat
Yo' bitch booty like a pancake, flat flapjack
I make your dollars collapse (Collapse), trail low in the strap
Shells big as a turtle, Master Splinter to rap
Sus-Sus-Suspend you like Urkel, your body hangin' from fat
Thought you was sharper than tacks, get you thrown like some jacks (Jacks)
A-All these bitches with these tassels on they titties tryna text
I don't give a fuck if none of y'all don't rap
I could pull a bitch just turnin' my back
W-Who do that? (Who do that?) Venus trap (Venus trap)
Flyest nigga in the class
Goyard bag, see that tag?
I could pay your rent all year, boy
Yo' mama know
Your cousin, sister, brother, and your mama know (Mama know)
Your cousin, sister, brother, and your mama know (Mama know)
Your cousin, sister, brother, and your mama know
Bitch, your granny know, nigga

Snapback back, put V.A. on the map
I'm a young nigga, heartthrob, girls cardiac
I got your girls all on my dick
Yeah, them chickens givin' me neck
Nigga, you ain't talkin' 'bout shit
Fuck your CD, press eject
Too busy coughin' up them hairballs
Fur coat, bear dog
Spray these niggas like aerosol
And fuck them old niggas, Geritol
Hol' up, snapback on
Champagne MCM backpack on
Lucky that my situation in this probation
Won't even let me strap that tome

Steez out with my D out
And you wonder why your shorty be disappearin'
Haha, I brought the snapback back
Last Kings and them Ti$as, yeah, they sell like crack
You got no car insurance, no Ray-Bans (Uh)
This GEICO caveman (Uh)
First of the month, you do a praise dance
Like I'm movin' on up, ayy, man (Bloaw!)
Stop that, drop a hat in the club (Oh shit)

Get more respect in L.A. than you do (Hahaha)
But you're welcome for the pub'
