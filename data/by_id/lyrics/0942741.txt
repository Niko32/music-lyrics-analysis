I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you

And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry
It's true, oh-oh-oh
You're giving me the same old line
I'm wondering why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no
Not a second time

You know you made me cry
I see no use in wondering why
I cry for you, yeah

And now you've changed your mind
I see no reason to change mine
I cry
It's you, oh-oh-h

You're giving me the same old line
I'm wond'ring why
You hurt me then
You're back again
No, no, no
Not a second time
