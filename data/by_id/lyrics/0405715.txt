Oooh Oooh
I got you (Tyler What up)
I got you

[Verse 1: Fred The Godson]
It kinds of reminding me the time of
Phoenix Gator
She wanted to see the crib
So I showed the pad
You ever seen a Raider?
Frederico, he the streets
False move
I can moonwalk in Adidas cleats
All black security see I.D the freaks
Took 3 home with me from one of my meet and greets
If I were God only the best to spare
With ... fillin' on the chest, shit
Not an x to slip
I need a priest
Just had sex with my ex's sis, huh
The God flee the whips
She can still walk
Any price, I can break a brick
But you can still show
The bars are hard
But this butter leather is still soft
I'm one of the greatest, my nigga
Real talk

I got you
I'm on your back
Feel like the feds are coming for me
Big city and bright lights
Always known to live the high life
Always

[Verse 2: Fred The Godson]
This reminds me of Curtis Mayfield
Fifty for yayo wonder what Curtis may feel, nah
I don't work just to pay bills
I still hustle black face
Bill Russell, he got a grey grill
It's all about what my wife and my daughter like
Instagram
I can't fight with my daughter's likes
We push kilos down the water like little Wayne
Like Wayne paid more
Because we more alike, what you think? Shit
See my chain
I'm connected like Wi-Fi
You can check with links is
I get money ,I'm with a brain,sis
Food for thought there's some dishes in the sink, shit
I'm with the Palmolive
I'm in and out 5 stars in the Palms Islands
Even though I rap
I let the steel talk
I'm one of the greatest, my nigga
Real talk
[Hook: Tyler Woods]
I got you
I'm on your back
Feel like the feds are coming for me
Big city and bright lights
Always known live the high life
Always
