I’m only gonna say this one verse
And you know I’m gonna murder it so call in the hearse
‘Cause when a rapper like myself flips and goes berzerk
All these fake ass people lose their nerve and then disperse
Motherfuckers still think I’m amateur
Because my shirts aren’t gucci and I don’t smoke the herb
When in reality I could kick your ass to the curb
With a simple one liner that ain’t even got a verb
They say I’m cocky and immature
Well I’m only eighteen but a trillion is my worth
And my tank is never empty I ain’t ever on reserve
And when I’m working on a song I don’t ever conserve
I use it all, my energy just bursts
Not like a bubble, but a nuke ‘cause I’m so diverse
I’m surfing over beats and serving beef to some jerks
Like a waiter in heat, I get pissed and ‘cause some burns
Warning, warning, said you best be alert
‘Cause your ship is sinking fast from my torpedo words
The ports are locked and you’re submerged but that’s not the worst
What is, is that your girl’s with me and she squirts
Sorry, I’m a bit of a pervert
But I be whistling Dixie when I talk like Herbert
I exert no effort when I birth
A hit song, no ad libs, no inserts
I make sure my career is preserved
The score is forty love and right now it’s my serve
You ain’t getting nothing in, your comeback’s terse
So I’ma end this now, this is my universeYou might also like
