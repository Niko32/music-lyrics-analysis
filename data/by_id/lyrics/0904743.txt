Take love
And multiply it by infinity
And take it to the depths of forever
And you would still only have a glimpse
Of how I feel for you

[Verse 1: Dahvie Vanity & JayyVon]
I was created
From spare parts (From spare parts)
A mad man's brains
And a loving man's heart (Loving man's heart)
You took my breathe away
When I saw you on that day
One look into her eyes
Can kick start a dead man's heart

[Pre-Chorus: Dahvie Vanity]
You leave me electrified
Your love brings me back to life

[Chorus: JayyVon, Dahvie Vanity & Haley Rose]
It's alive, it's alive
This burning love deep inside
I'll be your bri-i-ide
You'll be my Frankenstein
You and I
'Til we die
Our hearts will always survive
My monster
My monster
The only one that sees me
You might also like[Verse 2: Haley Rose & Dahvie Vanity]
I didn't ever
Mean to make you cry
When I saw you
I felt so terrified (So terrified)
Sudden life and monsters
By my side
Well
Can't you see how it looked (How it looked)
Through my eyes (My eyes)

[Pre-Chorus: Haley Rose]
You leave me electrified
Your love brings me back to life

[Chorus: JayyVon, Dahvie Vanity & Haley Rose]
It's alive, it's alive
This burning love deep inside
I'll be your bri-i-ide
You'll be my Frankenstein
I need you
You need me
You totally complete me
My monster
My monster
The only one that sees me
[Bridge: Dahvie Vanity]
Save me from my solitude
Say you want me with you
Where you are
I am too
Love me
This I ask of you

[Chorus: JayyVon, Dahvie Vanity & Haley Rose]
It's alive, it's alive
This burning love deep inside
I'll be your bri-i-ide
You'll be my Frankenstein
You and I
'Til we die
Our hearts will always survive
My monster
My monster
The only one that sees me

[Outro: Dahvie Vanity & JayyVon]
The only one who sees me
For who I truly am
