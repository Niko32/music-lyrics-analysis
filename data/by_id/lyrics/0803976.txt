But I like it
I like it like that

I Don't need a sign
'Cause I see it
When I look into your eyes

I can't explain
But it feels good
Feels good to me

You drive me insane
But I like it
I like it like that

This don't mean nothin'
Why does it tear you apart
This don't mean nothin'
Why is it breaking your heart

Don't let the lies
Sometimes
Leave it alone
Don't ask me why
'Cause there's no way
No way to describe
You might also likeYou drive me insane

This don't mean nothin'
Why does it tear you apart
This don't mean nothin'
Why is it breaking your heart

This don't mean nothin'
Why does it tear you apart
This don't mean nothin'
Why is it breaking your heart

This don't mean nothin'
Why does it tear you apart
This don't mean nothin'
Why does it tear you apart
