And your love was like the golden rays again
Now I'm lyin' here on a Thursday and you're lovin' someone new
And it looks like I'm up shit creek again

And I can't help thinkin' of your lovin' ways
And I've cried a quart of tears since you've been gone
And I can't face the morning by myself love
And it looks like I'm up shit creek again

Since you been gone I cry all the time
And I cannot stand leaving you behind

So I'll pull myself together and I'll dry away the tears
But the mornin' light has brought back memories
And I can't face the morning by myself love
And it looks like I'm up shit creek again

So I'm out a-walkin' on this dusty highway
'Cause you've given me no reason for to stay
And I'll walk until I've found someone who loves me not in vain
And it looks like I'm up shit creek again
And it looks like I'm up shit creek againYou might also like
