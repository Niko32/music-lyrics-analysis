Let Me Introduce Myself itz ur boy NovA

[Verse 1]
Every time I try to talk to you
Its like playing with broken glass
I try to pick up the pieces
But I’m afraid I’m gonna get slashed

There's nothing left for me to find
There's nothing for me here
I used to want to smile
But the reasons to have disappeared

[Chorus]
I got a reason to smile
You gimme a reason to cry
I got a reason to live
You gimme a reason to die
But it's all the same to me
Because I know the monster is there
Inside

[Verse 2]
When I look into the miror
I dont like what I see
I see the face of a sinner
Staring blankly at me
You might also likeSomebody release me from my prison
Tear these shackles from my legs
Someone remove the gag from my mouth
Somebody help me escape

Chorus
