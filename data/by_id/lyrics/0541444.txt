I step through the function, taking what I wanted
Young Beam God, bitch I'm lit as a pumpkin
Looking outside, and the sky feeling haunted
Grey clouds hover round me every damn morning
Step through the function, taking what I wanted
Young Beam God, catch me lit as a pumpkin
Every damn morning, the sky looking haunted
Hover round me every motherfucking damn...

[Verse 1]
Blunts full of ghosts, got me smoking my ex up
I don't be on twitter, everybody so extra
I don't got out to chase hoes, that's not for me
Switchblades full of blood, love when I make em bleed
Fire in your face, one swingers will break ya
Walking through your function emotionless face on
I'm staying to myself, looking like a young bitch
Anime on the screen, bet I fuck you up quick
IPhone full of lies, kid death, eating souls
And I rarely be alive, bitch I think it's best you know
I got shones in the mic, chai tea on the stove
Young Beam God swing til your flesh all broke, bitch
That's why I be dead all weekend
I only come alive in the winter
Frozen emotion, I bet you ain't know that the ghost young beam was a killer
I'm dead in your party, bet I'm plotting like it's columbine
Tomb raider Glocks, made of tears that my mama cried, bitch
You might also like[Hook]
Tomb raider Glocks, made of tears that my mama cried
Rap game, high school, treat that hoe like columbine
Young outcast, backpack full of notebooks
Failing every class, young beam up to no good
Tomb raider Glocks, made of tears that my mama cried
Rap game, high school, treat this hoe like columbine
Young outcast, backpack full of notebooks
Failing every class, young beam up to no good

[Verse 2]
Tsubaki blade sticking out of my pocket
I make your ass dance like eddy off tekken
Young Beam God, hair like edward scissorhands
I'm coming out the sky, light skin mewtwo man
Young ass bitch, shades like I'm on johnny cage
Who your favorite rapper is?, I kill his ass today
Young Beam God, born in a snow mountain
I'm draped up and dripped out looking like a fountain
Tea on the stove, whistling like a damn dove
Sipping on a christmas mug, damn near burned my tongue
Tripping how this bitch just killed the one she loved
Tripping how this bitch just killed the one she loved
