[Bridge + Hook - Akon]
This concrete’s too cold to be walking on it
Oh yes, walking on it with no shoes on
Don’t wanna struggle oh no
Don’t want it to become a habit
I'd be living in the gutter with no shoes on
Let me get up out of here before I
Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody
Before I
Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody
Before I
Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody
Before I
Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody

[Verse 1 - Akon]
My momma need a crib, son needs some Jordans
This is some bullshit, cause I can’t afford them
Feds listening, in the van recording
Trying to dodge the pen, hoping I survive the morning
Shit is getting hot, man I’m talking scorching
Watching bodies drop, trying to make a fortune
Dancing with no top, trying to stick my fork in
Wanna own the block then you gotta put your work in
Because

Hurt somebody, 'fore I have to hurt somebody

[Verse 2 - French Montana]
Brother need bail, stead calling
Dreaming out the cell, till he wakes up in the morning
Magic warp always disappears
Smoked got my eyes blurred
But my vision clear
Hothead, but this concrete cold
Titanium bitch I never fold
Never judge a nigga before you judge yourself
You ain’t got to help me
Nigga help yourself
They got their hand out
I don’t know what they told him
Well tell them I’m the mob
I don’t own them
I’ll take you to the sharks
They can't breathe out the water
I’ll tear your ass apart and put you out of order
