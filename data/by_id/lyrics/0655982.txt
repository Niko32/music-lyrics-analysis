Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin’ through the jasmine in my mind
Summer breeze makes me feel fine
Blowin’ through the jasmine in my mind

[Verse 1:]
See the curtains hanging in the window
In the evening on a Friday night
A little light shining in the window
Let’s me know everything’s alright

[Chorus]

[Verse 2:]
Sweet days of summer
The jasmine’s in bloom
July is just up and playin’ our tune
When I come home from a hard day’s work
And you’re waiting there
Not a care in the world

See the smile waiting in the kitchen
Home cooking on a plate for two
Feel the arms raising up to hold me
In the evening when the day is through
You might also like[Chorus]

Oh oh oh, the summer breeze
Oh oh oh, the summer breeze
