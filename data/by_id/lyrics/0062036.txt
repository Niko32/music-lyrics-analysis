Yo, you mad at this
Blowing hash, looking at buildings, feeling magnanimous
The kid stacked up
In magazines, banana clips
Mathematics flip digits no abacus
Slash half-African
Play it for your mans an'dem
Arrest kids play high-top fades, man on the plague, the chest lit (?)
The best in the chest, the rib cage
The birds sing, this that and a third thing
Early; 7:30
Words will never hurt me
The kevvy in the purse dirty
The baby daddy, the feddy, the japer?
For y'all square booties...
Who's smoother than bare coochie?
Are you stupid?
It's rare movie
DNA Cee-Lo switched seeds in my hair coolie
PMA I'm ego, it's me and I'm where you be
Drop rubies, like dookie
It's all Louie
Louie it's all good;
It's all groovy
It's all gooey
Oowee oowee LL Coolie
Sue me
American daydream machine up in the limousine
So post-guillotine
Imagine all the Troy Davis's and James Dean's
Baby's like maybe it's the same thing
Nah though, Pablo
Escobar, Pablo Picasso
The rest go hard
Me, I go farther
Y'all know (?? Spanish... ??)
Hotel sweet; bathroom floor made of marble
My car go slow, like escargo
Go though, oh no, no no, n-n-n-no
I didn't just really but I did though
Who the kid?
Kool AD, the kid go
Navigation in the navigator
Quid Pro Quo, skip rope - no
The kid so pro, it's so cold
The cookie jar lid so closed
Raise the rookie bar, give no more
Let me live though, yo
Put me in coach, I'm ready
Yo 9/10 of these haters is never ready
Remember me like John Lennon and Let it Be
Better yet, remember me like Heavy D
Bread so thorough, check the pedigree
West to the East in the bread
I'm the yeast check the recipe
Eat the beat up once, nah they want a "best of three"
Yes, please, test me
Young S.A.T
I'm the best, they be
Less than that, pay me
