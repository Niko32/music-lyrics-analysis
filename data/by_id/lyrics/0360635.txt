All my ladies bop yo heads (Ohh)
Come on and bop yo heads (Ohh)
Let me see you bop yo heads (Come on, come on)
Bop yo heads (Ohh, yo, uh)

[Verse 1]
Who in the world is this
Callin' me at 2:26 in the morning
Crack of dawn and got me yawnin'?
Why you tying up my line
Sayin' you apologize for all the lies you told me? (Lies)
Said you was chillin' with the homies (Lies)
You was chasin' all the shorties (That's right!)
And now, you clamin' you adore me (You gets no)

[Chorus]
You gets N-O-L-O-V-E from me
You be steady gamin' all the time
So, get O-U-T my F-A-C-E, baby, outta sight, outta mind
You gets N-O-L-O-V-E from me
Can't keep tellin' your lies
No more K-I-S-S-I-N-G me
Baby, outta sight, outta mind

[Verse 2]
Who in the world is this, ringing my bell?
10:46, yo, it's late as hell
You got the roses in ya arm and ya teddy bear
Trying to use your thuggish charm
But I just don't care
You say "don't be, (oh), don't be tripping" (Lies)
But, baby, ya game is slipping (That's right!)
You're just a child and I'm big pimping
I'm so over you
You might also like[Chorus]
You gets N-O-L-O-V-E from me
You be steady gamin' all the time
So, get O-U-T my F-A-C-E, baby, outta sight, outta mind
You gets N-O-L-O-V-E from me
Can't keep tellin' your lies
No more K-I-S-S-I-N-G me
Baby, outta sight, outta mind

[Bridge]
Thank you for leavin' me
I can finally get on my feet
Thank you for hitting the door
Now there's no more "what's mine is yours"
'Cause I'm free now, I don't need you now
Stack my cheese now
Sit on some D's now, wrists on freeze now
You can lie now, I don't cry now
Say bye-bye now, say bye-bye now
No second try now

[Chorus]
You gets N-O-L-O-V-E from me
You be steady gamin' all the time
So, get O-U-T my F-A-C-E, baby, outta sight, outta mind
You gets N-O-L-O-V-E from me
Can't keep tellin' your lies
No more K-I-S-S-I-N-G me
Baby, outta sight, outta mind
[Bridge]
You wanna, wanna be a player, player, go play
You wanna be a baller, baller, go ball
You don't ever ever have to worry, worry 'bout me
Baby, you and me can't kick it no more
You wanna, wanna be a player, player, go play
You wanna be a baller, baller, go ball
You don't ever ever have to worry, worry 'bout me
Baby, you and me can't kick it no more

[Chorus]
You gets N-O-L-O-V-E from me
You be steady gamin' all the time
So, get O-U-T my F-A-C-E baby outta sight outta mind
You gets N-O-L-O-V-E from me
Can't keep tellin' your lies
No more K-I-S-S-I-N-G me
Baby, outta sight, outta mind
