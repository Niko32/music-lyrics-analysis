Summer's leaving
It found me grieving
Living on my own thinking of you
Thinking of you

In the sand
By Rainbow River
My love did shiver till the fire and I warmed her again
Want you again
And I need you all through the night

Ah hold back the Winter Indian Summer
I'm not sure if I can take the snow
In mid December I can't help but wonder
How will I ever last till the coldness goes

Baby I miss you all through the day

Ah hold back the Winter Indian Summer
I'm not sure if I can take the snow
In mid December I can't help but wonder
How will I ever last till the coldness goes

You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you
You might also likeAh You don't know what it's like
You don't know what it's like
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you
