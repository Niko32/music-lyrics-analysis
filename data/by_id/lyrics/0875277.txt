Helps to me forget my daily pain
We make one step after another
And we try to discover our evil border

Senseless human beings
Try to define our feelings
And they gave us strange laws and orders
But in reality they seem to be murderers

We are just slaves
Trying not to end in graves
But soon, we will have to accept
That the holy wind is taking everything away
[x2]

The power of our useless brains
Helps to me forget my daily pain
We make one step after another
And we try to discover our evil border

Like an idiotic mass of robots
We are marching towards our own cell-blocks
Some tried to hide away
Like Mr. Che Che
But there's no more time to play
You might also likeWe are just slaves
Trying not to end in graves
But soon, we will have to accept
That the holy wind is taking everything away

That the holy wind is taking everything away
