Light out Wanderlust
Head us out to sea
Captain says there'll be a bust
This one's not for me

[Verse 2]
Take us from the dark
Out where we can see

[Refrain]
Captain's out to make his mark
This one's not to be

[Chorus]
Light out Wanderlust
Help us to be free
Light out Wanderlust
Do it just for me
Wanderlust

[Bridge]
Oh, where did I go wrong, my love?
What petty crime was I found guilty of?
What better time to find a brand new day?
Oh - Wanderlust away
You might also like[Chorus]
Light out Wanderlust
Help us to be free
Light out Wanderlust
Do it just for me
Wanderlust

[Refrain]
Captain's out to make his mark
This one's not to be

[Verse 1/Bridge Counter Melody]
Light out wanderlust
(Oh where did I go wrong, my love?)
Head us out to sea
(What petty crime was I found guilty of?)
Captain says there'll be a bust
(What better time to find a brand new day?)
This one's not for me
(Oh - wanderlust away)

[Outro]
Dropping a line
Maybe this time
It's wanderlust for me
