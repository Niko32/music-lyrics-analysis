Well I've blown a lot of money in my life and time
On pretty girls and lawyer fees and beer
Well my truck ain't repo'd yet
And my whistles stayin' wet
All my friends they see me spendin' but my checks don't ever clear
Because

[Chorus]
I'm broke, I'm broke
I said man alive, it ain't no joke
Lord knows my wallets gettin' pretty thin
Well I'm broke, I'm broke
I got just enough for snuff and smokes
And a 12 pack 'til I'm back on top again
That's right

[Verse 2]
My broke status don't preclude me from establishments like this
And if you're like me you'd probably do the same
See I ain't afraid to pay for drinks with quarters
Dimes and nickels if I have to, is that what Obama meant by change?

[Chorus]
I'm broke, I'm broke
I said man alive, it ain't no joke
Lord knows my wallets gettin' pretty thin
Well I'm broke, I'm broke
I got just enough for snuff and smokes
And a 12 pack 'til I'm back on top again
Wooo

Well I'm hoping this economy ain't always gonna suck
And I'm lookin' for my little bit of luck
So if you see me on the highway with my thumb out
Well it wouldn't hurt my feelings, if you went ahead and picked me up
Cause

[Chorus]
I'm broke, I'm broke
I said man alive, it ain't no joke
Lord knows my wallets gettin' pretty thin
Well I'm broke, I'm broke
I got just enough for snuff and smokes
And a 12 pack 'til I'm back on top again
Yeah a 12 pack 'til I'm back on top again
