Now is the time for children to sing
Now is the time for white Christmas for Bing
Because it's Christmas time

Now is the time to hang mistletoe
Now is the time to run through the snow
Now is the time to sing old Rudolph's Nose
Because it's Christmas time

Christmas time is a comin'
Santa's not far away
You can almost hear his ho ho ho
And the jingling of his sleigh

Now is the time
Christmas stories we will tell
Now is the time
Hang your stocking on the nail
Now is the time
Let us sing Jingle Bells
Because it's Christmas time
--- Instrumental ---

Christmas time is a comin'
Santa's not far away
You can almost hear his ho ho ho
And the jingling of his sleigh...You might also like
