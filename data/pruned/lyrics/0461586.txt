She's outrageous, scandalous
The way she rocks is too much
And she's fire and rain, she blows your brains
The way she works that body

[Verse 1]
And she'll tease ya and she'll please ya
She'll make you feel like you're king of the world
She's so funny takes your money
Ah! But that's just what she does
And it's all night baby, and it's alright baby

[Chorus]
She's outrageous, scandalous
The way she rocks is too much
And she's fire and rain, she blows your brains
The way she works that body

[Verse 2]
There's no weakness to her sweetness
She's as nasty as you wanna be
Can't deny her your desire
She'll love you good and set you free
And it's all night baby, and it's alright baby
You might also like[Chorus]
She's outrageous, scandalous
The way she rocks is too much
And she's fire and rain, she blows your brains
The way she works that body

[Instrumental Break]

Just you and me baby, you're driving me crazy
I'll spend a little more money, on you and me honey

[Chorus Outro]
She's outrageous, scandalous
The way she rocks is too much
And she's fire and rain, she blows your brains
The way she works that body
