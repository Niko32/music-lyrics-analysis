Don't be an idiot
You can't let it go
Till it won't come back
And you can't move forward
It's somethin' like a discord
It was so slow
That it crushes all the atoms
And destroys every molecule
Oh, but she's spinning like a windmill
My fingers get caught
And they get cut up
And they get cut off
Fly finger ear
And everyone's stoked
Nobody can drink
Or put on a seat belt

[Chorus]
My lips are so numb
But it's colder in my heart
I found the eight ball
Why you gotta get it so hot?
So hot, so cold

[Verse 2]
T-t-t-timing is everything
I'm all out of time
And smokes & luck
And beer & everything
Drink until you're sick
Then you're too sick to drink
And that is disastrous
Sun is the shade
And don't be an idiot
You can't let it go
Till it won't come back
And you can't move forward
Somethin' like a discord
It was too slow
That it crushed all the atoms
Destroyed all the molecules
You might also like[Chorus]
My lips are so numb
But it's colder in my heart
Ice on the eight ball
Why you gotta get it so hot?
So hot
You asked me do I wanna get high?
High
High
Get high
Are you joking?

Why you gotta always get it so hot?
So hot, so cold
Why you gotta get it so hot?
So hot, so cold
So hot, so cold
