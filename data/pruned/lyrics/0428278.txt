I'm getting tired now, I gotta get some sleep now
Guess I've been worried much too long
And don't wake me till it's over
When the need for you is gone

[Verse 2]
I was so happy before I loved you
I want to be like I was before
And don't wake me till it's over
When I won't want you anymore

[Bridge]
My eyes are getting weak now
I gotta get some sleep now
I gotta rest my aching head
I just want to lay here
Just let me stay here
Till the blues get up and leave my bed

[Verse]
Good night darling, good night darling
Good night forevermore
And don't wake me till it's over
When I won't love you anymore
You might also like[Bridge]
My eyes are getting weak now
I gotta get some sleep now
I gotta rest my aching head
I just want to lay here
Just let me stay here
Till the blues get up and leave my bed

[Verse 3]
Good night darling, good night darling
Good night forevermore
And don't wake me till it's over
When I won't love you anymore
