I've seen life through the eyes of a different soul
I left my past so my future would be under control
Now I've got nothin' standin' in my way
I gave it all away
I gave it all away

[Interlude]
Whoa
I gave it all

[Pre-Chorus]
You got me livin' how I've wanted all along
Now all my tears are dried away
You got me livin' how I've wanted all along

[Chorus]
I feel so alive, alive
Inside, inside
I'm breaking through the haze
To a brand new day
'Cause my heart has been revived

[Verse 2]
How was I supposed to survive in this vast sea?
I was so scared my own heart would try to abandon me
Now I've got nothin' standin' in my way
I gave it all away
I gave it all away
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You got me livin' how I've wanted all along
Now all my fears have run away
You got me livin' how I've wanted all along

[Chorus]
I feel so alive, alive
Inside, inside
I'm breaking through the haze
To a brand new day
'Cause my heart has been revived

I feel so alive, alive
Inside, inside
I'm breaking through the haze
To a brand new day
'Cause my heart has been revived

[Bridge]
(I feel so alive)
I feel a fire inside
It's like a whole new ride
I feel a sweet increase
Consuming all of me

(I feel so alive)
I feel a fire inside
It's like a whole new ride
I feel a sweet increase
Consuming all of me
(I feel so alive)
I feel a fire inside
It's like a whole new ride
I feel a sweet increase
Consuming all of me

(I feel so alive)
I feel a fire inside
It's like a whole new ride
It's like a whole new ride
It's like a whole new ride

[Chorus]
I feel so alive, alive (Alive)
Inside, inside (Yeah, inside)
I'm breaking through the haze
To a brand new day
'Cause my heart has been revived

I feel so alive, alive (Alive)
Inside, inside (Yeah, inside)
I'm breaking through the haze
To a brand new day
'Cause my heart has been revived

[Outro]
I feel so alive
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
I feel so alive
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
(Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
