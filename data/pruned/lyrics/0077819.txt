Forever mushy
Spoon fed pussies I eat em
I'm what spins
You eat rims
Billy the kid
Manning down the bitch
On adventures wit Grim
Bigger than the joker grins
Tell you bout my smiles?
You got em from my chick
Side kick
I spit
You are the side dish
Side of it
*Sighs* I sighed a bit
Jimmeny Crickets
Guilty Conscientious smaller than midgets

Verse 2-RodiMiS
Aye yo, Aye yo
Fantasies
Dance through creativity
Gold trimming
Every black fitted
Admit it
Taught crayola to be different
Imagination Land
South Park it
Rougher than the shark skin
Niggas throw bones with cartilage
Cardboard box em
From Michael to Joann
Artistic artillery man
Free Agent canvas ass
Paint pictures
No bad means
What the fuck happened like Mid summers night dream
Got Fins swimming through the beat
Deeper than the gods design for the corall reef
Talked to Zoro, counting Z's is counting sheep
Went to Scarface and Zelda, Asked for a Cuban Link
Nine to ten of doe's
Has control to smash bros
Band in the coupe
Crash Abandoned
This game, boy I advanced it
You gay hoes
Summon dark magician use my magic stick
Spin the disc
RodiMiS, I let it rip for eons
Brighter future than the neon
Start off jobs like peons
R-Kelly finish off
Trifecta with the orange
Woody Harrelson if the game is foreign
On the Venice beach
A sniper forfeits
So equipt how the gunman can hold a clip
007 them Europeans
The world I'm in
Headphone to the the button clicking
In this game you kill me bitch
Online pillaging
Computers the number one affiliate
Funny writing a walk through for you niggas
IGN business
Ignorant Gamers are Never mentioned

Watch as he's spoken
Dare to quote him
Never dare like smokin
What they say they can't hold it
Inhale and Exhale
They can't reveal what we say
We leave em like emails
We don't reply
We just decide
Listen to these cats as we ride by
Drive, and end it like....Game Over
