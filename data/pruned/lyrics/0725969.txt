Yeah, I remember it now, we were kids back then
Livin' down on the farm
We were told that the city
Could only bring us harm
"How far is the city?", somebody said
And, "Oh, that's a great big town"
And Barbara said, "Why, it's a million miles"
And the story got around

[Chorus:]
It's a million miles to the city
From the hills and valleys we know
It's a million miles to the city
And someday we all wanna go

[Verse 2:]
There was a town nearby but a town is a town
And the city well, that's something else
Our daddy had been to a city
But he never was much help
Why the buildings are taller than Oak trees
Ah, but we knew better than that
Ain't nobody could climb that high
The cities were wide and flat
You might also like[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
Well, now time has passed and we have grown
And traveled far and wide
The cities have changed the kids we were
We see it in each others eyes
But I'd love to go back to those hills again
To the boy I used to be
Where the leaves and the wind and the whippoorwills
Were part of the land like me

[Chorus][x2]
