Refleja la lugubre penuria del ser
Humano, hacia 1348 hacinabas muertos
Por decenas y tu vida era la muerte, arrebatassste la flor de mi vida
Pero aun asi me funesto deseo es adorarte
In the desolation the whole, scenario, the only sound is the constant
Moaning of the wind, overhead the immense sky is hazy black and resurgence
Of life is over. La muerte negra, spreads her ehinous wings and descending
Against human race, gathering of pale flowers, flowers on black veil
People sleep in suffering everyday
Trionfo della morte
As a crack in mankind
Thus, completing their cycle
In vitae in morte di horta funebra
No one will deny that bleakness, on symptom of the seventh doomplague
Terrestrial calvary mirrored a paradise in debris and sweetmisery regina
Matter putrefactio, the hadez followed with her a precious ange with
Fluttering dismay, seemed to become an enormous teratoid
Ad interitum funebrarum
Having recaptured the gloomy feeling
The insight it gave me as appallaing abyss is still
Vivid to me until my deathYou might also like
