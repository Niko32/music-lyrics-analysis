Uh Uh, Uh uh...

18 months old, had a vast lexicon
19 years old, adding to my repertoire
Ah ee eh oh oo goo goo ga ga
First word was probably doo doo ma ma
A real cool toddler, a verbal sensation
You could always find me in adult conversations
Daddy didn't like that, he sent me out the circle
Only person who appreciated was the doctor
Now I've got doctors feeling my music
Kaiser Permanente, I'm always down to do it
English, Spanish, fluent, Korean I could get it
The ladies really like it, I've got digits as my witness
Falling dead asleep in 한글 학교 (hangeul hakgyo)
Just to eventually teach 한글 학교 (hangeul hakgyo)
Ask me five years ago to do it, no way
I give all the credit to 새누리 교회 (Saenuri Gyohae)
어떻게? 이렇게 저렇게 해 (eoddeogae, ireogae, jeoreogae hae)
내가 한국말 잘 할못하는데 (naega hangookmal jal halmot haneundae)
몰랏어요? 난 흑인이에요 (molasseoyo? nan heugin ee aeyo)
천천히 가르쳐줄수있요? (chunchunhi gareuchyeo julsu eeseoyo?)
But let me tone it down like an 인사 (insa)
Before you complain 'bout different language in your speaker
5th grade is when I won the school spelling bee
Although I lost at district, wasn't nothing you could tell me
Shoot I could spell better than a sorcerer
Book me for your events, you're ordering an orator

You wanna ride? Well then get in
You want the Life? Then breathe it in
Do You wanna roll?
I know the way, just hold close to me
I'll take you home today

You wanna ride?
You want the Life?
You wanna roll?
I know the way

You wanna ride?
You want the Life?
You wanna roll?

[Verse 2: David Dilin]
Throw the bags in the trunk, let's roll
Before we take off
There are things you should know
"vocabulary's necessary
When digging into my library"
So grab a book
Listen to some visionaries
Read the supercalifragelisticexpialidictionary
Get enamored with the grammar of the summer sun
Read some Palina Nicole and fall in love with her
Make a Tumblr, write a poem for her
Call it "Hey You"
And ask if you can read it right in front of her
And when you get enough courage to perform it
Read it at the high school poetry club you started
Perform at fashion shows, open mics, churches
Nationals at a Colorado university
Make a second EP
Make sure you put your heart in it
Call it International Phonetic Architect
You wanna ride?
You want the Life?
You wanna roll?

You wanna ride?
You want the Life?
You wanna roll?
I know the way

You wanna ride?
You want the Life?
You wanna roll?
