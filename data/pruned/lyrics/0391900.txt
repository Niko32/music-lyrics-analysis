She took off her stockings
I held them to my face
She had your ankles
I felt filled with grace

[Verse 2]
"Two hundred dollars straight in
Two-fifty up the ass," she smiled and said
She unbuckled my belt
Pulled back her hair and sat in front of me on the bed

[Verse 3]
She said, "Honey, how's that feel
Do you want me to go slow?"
My eyes drifted out the window
And down to the road below

[Verse 4]
I felt my stomach tighten
As the sun bloodied the sky
And sliced through hotel blinds
I closed my eyes

[Verse 5]
Sunlight on the Amatitlan
Sunlight streaming through your hair
In the Valle de dos Rios
The smell of mock orange filled the air

We rode with the vaqueros
Down into cool rivers of green
I was sure the work and the smile coming out 'neath your hat
Was all I'll ever need

[Bridge]
Somehow all you ever need's
Never quite enough, you know
You and I, Maria, we learned it's so

[Verse 7]
She slipped me out of her mouth
"You're ready," she said
She took off her bra and panties, wet her finger, slipped it inside her
And crawled over me on the bed

[Verse 8]
She poured me another whiskey
Said "here's to the best you ever had"
We laughed and made a toast
It wasn't the best I ever had, not even close
