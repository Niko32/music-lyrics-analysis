And into the punchbowl
And that sets just about everybody off
And the kids start screaming
Somebody fainted on me
I got ketchup all over my dress

She always looked so beautiful
Always looked so beautiful
But she never looked as beautiful as she did tonight
Woah oh oh oh, it's such a tragedy that she didn't live to see tonight
Woah oh oh oh, she looked so good tonight

The head rolls out of the punchbowl
And onto the dancefloor
And looks at me with her pleading, bleeding eyes
And the fists start flying
All the girls are crying
I would say sorry but I hate to lie

You always look so beautiful
Always look so beautiful
But you never looked as beautiful as you did tonight
Woah oh oh oh
That oughta make you see that you shoulda come with me tonight
Woah oh oh oh, you look so good tonightYou might also like
