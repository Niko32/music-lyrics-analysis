Unh, I mean I seen that you need a ride
And when you got up in the whip you was much obliged
I mean I took you to the crib and fucked you real good
Nice body but the sex game was so Meagan Good
Unh, you had me feeling like the right guy
No text or call now I'm feeling like the bad guy
Bad sex on my part, man it couldn't be
Now you gone outta my life, man it can't be
You got me thinking that this was just a one night stand
One girl and a man, girl I understand
That the deal was to fuck and get on through but I can't help but I thinking I'm feeling you

[Verse 2: Rico]
I met you in the club, I was fresh as fuck
From the moment we spoke I knew that I was in love
I just said what's up, and you said nothing much
And you just left ya man and I'm bout to leave this club
And since we had our lil convo you wanna keep in touch
And I just wanna touch, so I took you to the room and took yo clothes off
And decided to beat it up before I dozed off
And when I woke the next morning baby you was gone
I had no number to ya phone, wondered what was wrong
But a letter to my side explaining that you had a man
So basically we just had a one night stand, damn

One night stand
Cause tonight I ain't got no man
He was a cheater and I needed a stress reliever
So I called up my...
I needed the good head and he wasn't down in bed
One night stand
Gripping the sheets, got my back
Don't need this man

[Verse 3: Beno]
She screaming deeper
I put it deeper
I put her legs beside my head while I eat her
She got a man but she say he don't hit it right
I got a girl but she never at home at night
I dive in it, Michael Phelps
High sex, I eat that pussy on stilts
Then I lay down on the bed and tell her fuck herself
I beat the pussy up, I deserve a belt
I bend over and I spank her like her dad
And yeah I kill the pussy I should fuck wit a toe-tag
No strings attached this a one night stand
I know we fucking but I can't ya man

[Chorus: Melodik Tonez]
One night stand
Cause tonight I ain't got no man
He was a cheater and I needed a stress reliever
So I called up my...
I needed the good head and he wasn't down in bed
One night stand
Gripping the sheets, got my back
Don't need this man
