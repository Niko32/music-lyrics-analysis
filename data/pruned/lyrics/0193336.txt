Never been so proud of myself
Lookin' out for me, for once, putting me before someone else
A selfish love has been my experience
On the unfortunate side of a love that just takes and never gives

[Chorus 1]
But oh oh, no more feeling sorry for myself
'Cause I know my worth
And oh-oh, I will no longer settle for whatever
'Cause I know I deserve heaven and earth, yeah

[Verse 2]
Finally realized that you just don't know, no
You're not capable of loving me like you should
And you won't be until you grow
And losing me is proof that you reap back what you sew

[Chorus 2]
So, no more feeling sorry for myself
'Cause I know my worth
And oh oh I, will no longer settle for whatever
'Cause I know I deserve heaven and earth
Yeah, for all that it's worth
Oh, heaven and earth
Ooh

No I, no more feeling sorry for myself
'Cause I know my worth
And oh-oh I, will no longer settle for whatever
'Cause I know I deserve heaven and earth
I know that I, I know that I, deserve heaven and earth
I know that I, I know that I, deserve heaven and earth
