Keep on walking and walking talking to myself
Keep on walking and walking talking to myself
Gal I love with somebody's else

[Verse 2]
I got the hard road blues walking on down the line
I got the hard road blues walking on down the line
Maybe some day my gal must change her mind

[Verse 3]
It's a hard hard road when your baby done throwed you down
It's a hard hard road when your baby done throwed you down
Going to keep on walking from town to town

[Verse 4]
It's been a long long time since I seen my baby's face
It's been a long long time since I seen my baby's face
And I don't see her joker stand to my place

[Verse 5]
I'm going to find my baby don't say she can't be found
I'm going to find my baby don't say she can't be found
Going to walk this hard hard road until my mustache drags the groundYou might also like
