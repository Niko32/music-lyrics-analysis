I woke up in a stranger's bed
With pins and needles in my head
And the clock ticking off the wall
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I don't even know myself
I wish I could be someone else
But I don't have a clue at all
Oh yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sinking, you're wading
I'm thinking something's gotta give

[Chorus]
Oh, wake me up, say enough is enough
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give
Oh, pull me out of this sinking town
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give

[Verse 2]
Maybe I'm a fucking waste
Filling up the empty space
I've been here way too long
Oh yeah, oh yeah
I'm feeling like a nervous wreck
Living on the last paycheck
I'm the clich√© in a song
And everybody's singing along
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sinking, you're wading
I'm thinking something's gotta give

[Chorus]
Oh, wake me up, say enough is enough
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give
Oh, pull me out of this sinking town
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give

[Bridge]
Someone please come pull me out
From the shadow of my doubt
Wake me up, I'm falling

[Chorus]
Oh, wake me up, say enough is enough
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give
Oh, pull me out of this sinking town
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give
I'm sinking, you're waiting
I'm thinking something's gotta give
Oh, pull me out of this sinking town
I'm dying to live, something's gotta give
