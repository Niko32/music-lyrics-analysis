When I awoke, I felt the call to go
Those places that I never thought I'd go
I spent the time to see which way to walk
But now that road just crumbles as I talk

[Chorus 1]
So don't let the ones that want to steal your dreams, they'll steal your dreams away
Just laugh and let it go
Don't let the ones that want to steal your dreams, they'll steal your dreams away
Just laugh and let it go

[Verse 2]
So you've tried to pass along your doubt
Oh, you need somebody's ears to hear you shout
All your wasted days and twisted ways are up
So now it's time to see the cards you're dealt

[Chorus 2]
Don't let the ones that want to steal your dreams, they'll steal your dreams away
Just laugh and let it go

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
I know all your names
Pointing different ways; let me out
I came up I saw you there
Now I know, now I know
I rose up my fear was gone
Now I know, now I know
You might also like[Chorus 1]
So don't let the ones that want to steal your dreams, they'll steal your dreams away
Just laugh and let it go
Don't let the ones that want to steal your dreams, they'll steal your dreams away
Just laugh and let it go
