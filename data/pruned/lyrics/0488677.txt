I don't need a hundred roses waiting by the front door
I don't need a fancy house in the hills
You could rope the moon and bring me all the stars in heaven
It won't change how I feel
You don't have to be a modern-day Shakespeare
You don't have to be anything you're not
You don't have to give me diamonds to impress me
Just give me your heart

[Chorus]
Make me feel loved, make me feel beautiful
Make me feel dance-around-the-room-Cinderella kind of magical
Make me believe I'm all that you'll ever need
Hold me close and make me feel a million kinds of wonderful
Baby, your touch, it's more than enough
Make me feel loved

[Verse 2]
It's the way you bring me coffee in the morning
And how you know just what not to say
I don't need you to try and fix everything
When I've had a bad day

[Chorus]
Make me feel loved, make me feel beautiful
Make me feel dance-around-the-room-Cinderella kind of magical
Make me believe I'm all that you'll ever need
Hold me close and make me feel a million kinds of wonderful
Baby, your touch, it's more than enough
Make me feel loved
You might also like[Chorus]
Make me feel loved, make me feel beautiful
Make me feel dance-around-the-room-Cinderella kind of magical
Make me believe I'm all that you'll ever need
Hold me close and make me feel a million kinds of wonderful
Baby, your touch, it's more than enough
Make me feel loved
