Cisis solved,deadline made
I came home like always tired and beat
Threw dinner in the microwave
Beside it on the counter lay
A letter from my wife addressed to me

It said, I know you're working hard that's easy to see
Tryin' to provide the best for the kids and me
We've had less to work with but we've always worked it out
A house and yard clothes and cars ain't all it's all about

It's about time that you're not givin' life, that you're not livin'
Losin' your focus not knowin' you don't notice
That our dreams are slowly fadin'
Are you hearin' what I'm sayin'?

Don't you think we're worth the sacrifice
Cause if we are, you need to realize, it's about time

While you were on a business trip to bad you had to miss
Your spittin' image hit the winnin' run
You know he adores you he was looking for you
Remember that you promised him you'd come

Did you know your little girl lost her front tooth today
She put it underneath her pillow and tried to stay awake
I laid down beside her didn't want to sleep alone
This is not about not loving can't you see what's going on?

Losin' your focus not knowin' you don't notice
That our dreams are slowly fadin'
Are you hearin' what I'm sayin'?

I walked up the stairs to find three angels sound asleep
One by one I tucked 'em in and kissed 'em on the cheek
I stood there and thought about how selfish I had been
And how one day without 'em would be more than I could stand

And now I understand
It's about time I should be givin'...
