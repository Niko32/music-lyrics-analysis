I woke with distaste
And I railed
And I raved

That the difference between
The sprout and the bean
It is a golden ring
It is a twisted string
And you can ask the counselor
And you can ask the king
And I'll say the same thing
And it's a funny thing
Should we go outside?
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are y'interested?

And as I said
I slept as though dead
Dreaming seamless dreams
Of lead

When you go away
I am big-boned and fey
In the dust of the day
And in the dirt of the day
You might also likeAnd the danger, danger
Drawing near them was a white coat
And the danger, danger
Drawing near them was a broad boat
And the water, water
Running clear beneath a white throat
And the hollow chatter
Of the talking of the tadpoles

Who know th'outside?
Should we go outside?
Should we break some bread?
Are y'interested?
