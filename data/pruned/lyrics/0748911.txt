Hello, yeah. I miss you too. Doesn't matter to me, as long as I get to see you. Okay. I'm headed up right now. Alright see you soon

[Hook]
Boy I'm by your side, I don't know where
I'm your ride or die, I don't know where
If you need me boy I'm a call away
If you need me boy I'm a call away

[Verse 1]
Pick up your phone boy, call me if you need me
You could just wanna talk, or you could just wanna see me
I'm down with that
Yeah boy I'm down with that

[Pre-Hook]
Cause you give me a feeling I cannot describe
I be fighting with my pillow, I can't sleep at night
Thinking bout you
Thinking bout you

[Hook] x2

[Verse 2]
We can chill at home boy, watch a little TV
We can take a long walk any time you wanna see me
I'm down with that
You know I'm down with that

[Bridge]
It feels so far when you'r away
I'm wishing on a star when you're away
Boy we will always be together
Through any type of weather
Baby I'm here and I ain't going nowhere
