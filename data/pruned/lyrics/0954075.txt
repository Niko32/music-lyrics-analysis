(Whiskey and wimmen)

[Verse 1]
Whiskey and wimmen
Just about done wrecked my life
Whiskey and wimmen
Just about done wrecked my life
I would have had money today
But they have wrecked my life almost

[Verse 2]
Nightlife, nightlife
Done got the best of me
Nightlife, nightlife, wimmen
Done got the best of me
I had a lot of money one time
But whiskey and wimmen, they tore it down

[Verse 3]
When I had money
I'd been drunk both night and day
I had money, I had money
I'd been drunk both ev'ry night and day
I'd get stoned, I'd get stoned
Ev'ry night I had a different girl, different girl

If I ever
Get back on my feet again
If I ever
Get back on my feet again

Wreck my life no more, yeah-yeah (Yeah-yeah)

Look-a here now

[Verse 5]
At one time, had a whole lot of money one time
Pretty fine car and fine clothes
And a whole lot of money
But nightlife and wimmen and whiskey
Stole that away from me
It took that away from me

[Bridge]
Nightlife, nightlife, nightlife
Ain't no good for me
Look-a here, look-a here, look-a here

[Verse 6]
I'm goin' back home
Pick up my old gal, Sue

And get my old gal, Sue
I'm gonna tell her baby, baby
Treat me the way it used to be
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 7]
Now, I'm broke
I don't have a friend around
All my money gone, gone
I don't have a friend around
Whiskey and wimmen, nightlife wrecked my life
Whiskey, whiskey and night life and wimmen done wrecked my life
