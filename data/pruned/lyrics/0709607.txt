Always five steps between me and him
From a desk I have view to his chin
If I had the code to his grin
The loss of traction could sink in
It's pullin' me out of my skin
Get so worn down wishing for him
To bring me to a near Motor Inn
And play me like a soft violin

[Chorus]
How soon will I get to know
If dreaming of you is wasting my time
Don't you know while my body is growing
I'm spending my days watching you time

[Verse 2]
Each Friday when he's not on my bus
I miss him like an addict needs her drugs
No one tells a believer to give up
Scribble his name with a pen he's struck
If for one day I could be anybody
I'd let him kill me for a taste of his blood
And maybe some day he'll notice me
If I keep a close proximity
You might also like[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Who says that you're taken
If that's true then what did I miss (I don't believe it no)
But soon I'll have you coming (And soon you'll be leaving her)
I just need to get my first kiss (Give you my kiss)

How soon will I get to know (Tell me how soon will I know?)
If dreaming of you is wasting my time (I'm still thinking of you)
Don't you know while my body is growing (But I can't)
I'm spending my days watching you time (Spend all my days)

[Breakdown]
How soon will I get to know
If dreaming of you is wasting my time
Don't you know while my body is growing
I'm spending my days watching you time
