Tonight keeps looking back at me with neon eyes
And if they've seen you they're not talking
You think by now maybe they'd sympathize

Out in the rain I keep on walking
Out in the rain like the brokenhearted do
I could be wrong but that's where you'll find me
Out in the rain just looking for you

The sky is cryin' the wind's against me
Blows like some fugitive with no place left to hide
I'm down to nothing but just this heartache
That I keep carrying around inside

Out in the rain

I take no comfort in my companion
The rain just coming down now wild and uncontrolled
Don't try to stop me you best take shelter
Tonight the sky will not be consoledYou might also like
