Find me here, speak to me
I want to feel you
I need to hear you

You are the light thatâ€™s leading me
To the place where I find peace
You are the strength that keeps me walking
You are the hope that keeps me trusting
You are the light to my soul, light it up, shine bright
You are my purpose, you are my everything, yes, you are

[Hook]
How can I stand here with you and not be moved by you?
Would you tell me how could it be any better than this?

[Verse 2]
You calm my soul, you give me rest
You hold me in your hands
You will never let me fall
You stole my heart and you take my breath away
Would you take me in, take me safe?

[Hook x2]

So take me deeper, deeper, deeper now
Deeper, deeper, deeper
Take me deeper, deeper, deeper now
Deeper, deeper, deeper now
Hey, take me deeper now
