One time for the land down under
Two times for Mr. Worldwide
Three times for the gorgeous Jessica
Now let's ride

[Verse 1: Jessica Mauboy]
I met a fella at the bar
I know he slipped me something strong
Said, "Won't you be my Valentine for the night?"
I said, "Who do you think you're talking to?
Before this girl gets cute with you
I need to see the way you move
If I'm gon' call you mine"

[Pre-Chorus: Jessica Mauboy]
Oh, I'm not falling to my knees
You know I'm one of a kind
If you really wanna take a chance on me
Then dance on me, let's unwind

[Chorus: Jessica Mauboy]
Just get up on your heels
The bass drop and the keys just won't stop
Here's the D, you're gonna dance with me tonight
Swing from here to there
Let go of all your cares
A ride to love and fate
Gotta dance with me tonight
You might also like[Post-Chorus: Jessica Mauboy]
Kick up your heels and swing with me
Oh my baby
Kick up your heels and swing with me
Gotta dance with me tonight
Kick up your heels and swing with me
Oh my baby
Swing it like you mean it

[Verse 2: Jessica Mauboy]
They say that you're the cat's meow (Meow)
I'm curious what you're about
You're dangerous without a doubt
But, it's alright
You may or may not be the one
For now we're only having fun
You talk like you've already won
But we still got the night

[Pre-Chorus: Jessica Mauboy]
Oh, I'm not falling to my knees
You know I'm one of a kind
If you really wanna take a chance on me
Then dance on me, let's unwind

[Chorus: Jessica Mauboy]
Just get up on your heels
The bass drop and the keys just won't stop
Here's the D, you're gonna dance with me tonight
Swing from here to there
Let go of all your cares (Yeah)
A ride to love and fate
Gotta dance with me tonight
[Post-Chorus: Jessica Mauboy]
Kick up your heels and swing with me
Oh my baby (My, my)
Kick up your heels and swing with me
Gotta dance with me tonight (Dance with me tonight)
Kick up your heels and swing with me
Oh my baby (Yeah)
Swing it like you mean it

[Bridge: Pitbull]
Woo-ooh!
I got a bad habit of being with women that look like Jessica Rabbit
You know I gotta have it, tag it, rip and grab it
Lick it, stick it, kiss and bag it
I love it when they keep they heels on and clothes off (Right)
I'm tryna find my mind but it's so lost
I'm tryna turn you on and get you so off
These boys act like they hard but they so soft
Visa to visa, country to country
Sending here bees and the women who love me
They sayin' they need me, they sayin' they want me
Catch me in the Bahamas eatin' Chonky Conky
Getting harder than the FK, huh
Just so I can F that
I don't need the pope to bless that
That's what I'm here for, babe dale
Woo!
[Chorus: Jessica Mauboy]
Just get up on your heels (Oh)
The bass drop and the keys just won't stop
Here's the D, you're gonna dance with me tonight
Swing from here to there (Yeah, oh)
Let go of all your cares
A ride to love and fate
Gotta dance with me tonight (Yeah)

[Post-Chorus: Jessica Mauboy]
Kick up your heels and swing with me (Oh)
Oh my baby (Doo-bi-doo-bi-doo-doo)
Kick up your heels and swing with me
Gotta dance with me tonight
Kick up your heels and swing with me
Oh my baby
Swing it like you mean it
Ah-ah, du-dun, yeah
