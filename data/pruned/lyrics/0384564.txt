Baby, you are all I feel
Your word, just hand me the pill
Sergeant, you got me running drills
Like left right, left right
Sleepless in the darkest part
Won't you let me out of my box?
But you got me like

[Pre-Chorus]
Damn, can't get you off my mind
Forced to have you in, forced, forced
Forced to have you in rewind
Forced to have you in rewind

[Chorus]
Careless over you
Lost my mind
Why won't you pursue
When you know
I could take you there
I could, I could take you there?
I could take you there
I could,  could take you there?

[Verse 2]
Nervous, struggling to breathe
I love when you're next to me
My post is like a bomb
It's about to blow, just tick tick tick tick
I'm losing all of control
Falling with nothing to hold
Look what is left of my soul
Where did you go?
But you got me like
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're lonely
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you need me
Tell me baby
Tell me that you're lonely
Tell me that you want me
Tell me that you need me

[Chorus]
