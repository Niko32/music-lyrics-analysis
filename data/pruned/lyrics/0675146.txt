I like that word "cosmic," it’s just the way that people tend to use it
That offends my sense of survival
Oh and I love the way you talk, honey, that’s very rock and roll
You said you come from Texas, but I don’t believe so, no

[Chorus]
Who do you think that you are to be jiving me like that?
Who do you think that you are?
Who do you think that you are to be jiving me like that?
Who do you think that you are?

[Verse 2]
One leg at a time, one leg at a time
Honey, I’ll bet you put your britches on one leg at a time
Now you can’t fool me, no, you can’t fool me
'Cause I've been to Fort Worth and you can’t fool me

[Chorus]
Who do you think that you are to be jiving me like that?
Who do you think that you are?
Who do you think that you are to be jiving me like that?
Who do you think that you are?

Now you know what they say about having too much fun
Woo, they tell you that it can’t be done
But I'm feeling real good, honey I never have felt greater
I don’t believe you can put too much gravy on tomatoes
She say

[Chorus]
Who do you think that you are to be jiving me like that?
Honey, who do you think that you are?
Who do you think that you are to be jiving me like that?
Who do you think that you are?

[Outro]
Who do you think that you are?
I said who do you think that you, who do you think that you
Who do you think that you are?
