The voice inside my head tells me to flinch when I sing
I've flipped my wig back, wound my neck in, done all things that can't help
Don't think I have a problem, I just think I like to feel

I'm possessed
I'm possessed
I'm possessed
I'm possessed

I don't wanna know what you think, I know something else
I don't wanna know what you think, I know something else

I'm possessed
I'm possessed
I'm possessed
I'm possessed

I don't wanna know what you think
I don't wanna know what you think
I don't wanna know what you think, I know something else

I'm possessed
I'm possessed
I'm possessed
I'm possessed

The voice inside my head tells me to flinch when I sing
I've flipped my wig back, wound my neck in, done all things that can't help
Don't think I have a problem, I just think I like to feel
I'm possessed
