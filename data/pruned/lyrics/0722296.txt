Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

[Verse 1: Zac Brown]
Black dog drinks from the water trying to cool his tongue
Like the king, finds no peace, his work is never done
Night falls, smoke on the water, darkness closes in
Cold white hand in the deep will drown you for your sins

[Chorus 2: Zac Brown]
It's a life long expedition
Second guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
Pages keep on filling

[Bridge: Zac Brown]
Crying out "Go and wake the king"
Call to arms for those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground, the walls are coming down
It's do or die! Do or die!

[Chorus 1: Chris Cornell]
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown

Mad man, blood on the altar, The Queen will have his head
His ghost will shake those rattling chains long after he's dead
No soul knows his trouble high upon his throne
Loved by few and judged by many, he bears that weight alone

[Chorus 2: Chris Cornell]
It's a life long expedition
Second guessing your decisions
Trying to find out what's been missing
And the pages keep on filling

[Bridge: Chris Cornell]
Crying out "Go and wake the king"
Call to arms for those who kiss the ring
Stand your ground, yeah the walls are coming down
It's do or die! Do or die!

[Chorus 1: Chris Cornell]
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
Heavy is the head that wears the crown
