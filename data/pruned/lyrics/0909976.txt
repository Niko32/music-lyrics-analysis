Arlene, I'm sorry for what I've done
I wasn't looking for love till I saw
Your red hair in the sun
What we had, could never be love
That was easy to see
But when I saw you at Red's
Pouring coffee
Something took a hold of me

[Chorus]
Arlene, you wouldn't even let me
Hold your hand
When I stopped you in the road
You just screamed and ran

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Arlene, you wouldn't even let me
Hold your hand
When I stopped you in the road
You just screamed and ran

[Verse 2]
That night I decided that I was gonna marry you
My knife went through your screen door
And I went away with you
You were singing "Please, let me go!"
All the way down to Miller's cave
When I picked a stick up off the ground
You cried, "I ain't ready for my grave"
You might also like[Chorus]
But Arlene, in the dark
Your hair's just as red
And this long, dark cave
Will always be our wedding bed

[Outro]
Ooh-oh, in the dark
Your hair's just as red
And this long, dark cave
Will always be our wedding bed
