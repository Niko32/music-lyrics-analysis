Help me walk this line
Hold my hand until tomorrow
Until we light the sky

Thoughts that change us
We have no control
The love that finds us
With eager eyes
We search the night

Erase the things I've said
Measure the things I've done
Pull me from the darkness
Setting me in the Sun

With eyes that see tomorrow
With hope that we will find
Forever will we see
The night that led us blindYou might also like
