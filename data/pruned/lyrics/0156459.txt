Woah…yeah yeah yeah
Courtney!
Rip…
Whatever man, everyone does that ad-lib…ha!
Now girls, what we gonna call these guys that don’t like it?
The waste men!

[Verse 1]
You can adore me on Sunday, as Sunday’s my only day off
You know that I don’t wanna hang with no stranger
After I’m done I want gone, but I have to say
All your chocolate got me meltin’ baby
Got me meltin’, oh my days, yeah!
Let me give you double helpings, you’ll be screaming
Baby baby baby baby… uh uh!

[Hook]
Oh oh oh, make me cum and I’ll go
Cause I won’t need you no more (no!)
Foreplay's fine but I ain’t got the time
Why don’t you hurry up, yeah hurry up, yeah hurry up!
Fuck me…

[Verse 2]
You better call your friend Johnny, you wanna hope he’s in town
Cause you know when you blow that I don’t want no… d-d-d-d-danger!
Without him it ain’t going down, but I have to say…
Milky bar kid got me melting
Sugar with that geek chic all the way
Do your thing and don’t be speaking not unless it’s dirty, dirty filthy dirty!

[Travie McCoy]
It’s Travie!
Listen…
I don’t know what you take me as
But it’s obvious your girlfriends got you gassed
I’ve spent most my life chasing ass
Now I’m tired
So we gonna have to make this fast!

Second thought, I'll hit the e-brake
Let me set the D five up, we’re gonna make a freaky tape
Kiss me soft right here
I’m a freak but hey
Piss me off, I swear to God I'm gonna leak the tape
Matter of fact, I’d rather masturbate
Than deal with another basket case
Ah, what a waste of a fat booty!
I used to beg her but why bother when they hand it to me

Listen mate, I don’t mean to brag
I’m telling you I’ma be the best you’ve had
So let’s roll! Don’t be taking your time
Get it up, poke it in, blow my mind!
Blow my mind…
And the rest I swallow
Courtney!
Ha-ha I’m joking you know I don’t do dick!
[Hook]
Oh oh oh, turn it up and I’ll go
Cause I won’t need you no more (no!)
Your place, fine but I ain’t got the time
Why don’t you hurry up, yeah hurry up, yeah hurry up!

Where’s the music gone?
Love me…

Why don’t you…
Fuck me
Ohhh

Hey diddle diddle, my cat needs a fiddle!
