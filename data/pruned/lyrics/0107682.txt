Being your guy is a monster habit
And you can't hide your love, it's true
It's the fetal game, you can see it every day
Let your freedom hang free
Come on down, I know how
I'm gonna make you come clear
Don't you know it ain't no thing to be for?
So, don't take more than you need
It's something that I'll do later
Now, it's over my...

[Chorus]
It's under my voodoo
Under my voodoo
It's under my voodoo

[Verse 2]
Pray that I leave you high and dry
Pray you can magnify
If your fated blood was in my prayers
I damn well feel it
I won't lie
I'm tellin' the truth
It ain't no fee, if you wanna get...
(One thing, no more)
(Gonna hit it, prolong it)
(I've always known but...)
(Fight for his country, won't he?)
(Gone, gone, gone, gone)
(Said, listen, but you gotta get your life)
(God, God)

Under my voodoo
Under my voodoo
It's under my voodoo

[Outro]
Free
Lord, God, voodoo
Lord, hey, voodoo
Lord, hey, voodoo
What you wan', you wan', you wan', you wanna do?
Lord
Wanna, wanna, wanna pack up
I wanna get to Peek-A-Boos
