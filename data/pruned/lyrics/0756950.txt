That fella plays the organ like it's boilin' on his tongue

Spittin' blind across the keys, those flick'rin' notes like ashes flung

To the whipping o' the breezes

The lashin' o' the light

And his fingers fired wi' some beautiful rapture

Some throbbin' in his soul all raised in lumps across his chest

Some arachnid terror swinging on his spine, he's stood possessed

By the thousand devils laughin'

In the gaps atween the sighs

She throws her head back 'gainst the screen, she's pushin' my hand away

She says "Oh what I'd give for to sound like I have nothin' left to say"

What use is a voice, she says, all shining?
You might also likeAll shimmering?

Oh to conjure sapphire smoke-rings from these pages

These pages all impressions of those smoke-rings I recall

Windin' up and out and throbbin' in the cracks behind the walls

Where all those fellas high on Jesus

Screech silent in the night

For to find something that's worth the hours o' searchin'

For something new to say with all these tired metaphors

These lines all thick wi' lines I've used a hundred times before

Yeah I'm looking at these words

And yeah, I'm sickened at the sight

And stood by the gates o' the cemetery I'm craving a fresh new way

To say, "Yeah this is what I been thinkin' about since last I came this way"
And they

They'll smile as they watch that fresh phrase shining

And shimmering

And I met a poet high on aching language

I met her in a red-light bar-room looks out o'er the sea

And in time I fell in love wi' her, and she in love wi' me

And she kisses me like melody

Might kiss the saddest songs

And I'm fishin' for a verse or two to hand her

A verse that maybe tells her somethin' close to what I feel

When she wakes me in the morning an I see the new day reelin'

In the corners of her smile

Her smile all glistenin' in the dawn
And sometimes I'm lain there 'neath the sheets and I'm tastin' her dreams

And I…

I'm hearin' the songs all spun cross winding stages back her eyes

And I…

I'm feelin her breath against my chest, well, yeah

I'm trembling…
