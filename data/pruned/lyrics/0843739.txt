Don't care if he's young or old
It's the sense you're barking up the wrong tree
But if you wanna get your kicks
From a boy who knows the tricks
If it's love you want, baby, that's me

If you want a guy with class
Who's way above the mass
Well, I'm not the right person obviously
But if you want to get that glow
From a cat that's in the know
If it's love you want, baby, that's me

So take your time and think it over
Don't do anything that's rash
Don't go for a guy with flash
'Cause love will last longer than cash

If you want a streamlined car
Or a handsome movie star
I'm not the right type, I must agree
But if you feel like getting sent
From a truly righteous gent
If it's love you want, baby, that's me
You might also likeNow I don't claim to be the kind you'd love on sight
Yet it has been done and who knows, you might
But I'm a past master on making love with a technique all my own
So if it's love you want, baby, come on, let's go home

When they wrote the dictionary and they wanted to know about love
It was me that Mr. Webster and all them other fellas was thinking of
Cause I put the "L" in love and the "X" in ecstasy
So if it's love you want, baby, that's me

I've made love in San Francisco sitting on the Golden Gates
And I'm known from coast to coast in all the 48 states
I've got all lovers confused tryin' to learn the methods I use
So if it's love you want, baby, that's me

My father was a lover way before my time
But the method he used was that old outdated kind
The technique I use would run him right out of his mind
So if it's love you want, baby, that's me

So take your time and think it over
Don't do anything that's rash
Don't go for a guy with flash
'Cause love will last longer than cash

If you want a guy with class
Who's way above the mass
Well, I'm not the right person obviously
But if you want to get that glow
From a cat that's in the know
If it's love you want, baby, that's me
If it's love you want, baby, that's me
