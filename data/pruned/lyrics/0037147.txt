[Chorus: Poshion]
Time (time will reveal) will reveal (time will reveal)
It all (it all), it all (it all)

[Mo! Hart]
I'm hearin' voices all the time in my head
Everywhere I go, so it seems that I'm confused on what to do
Are you helping me choose right from wrong?
Are you tryin' to help me?
Show me the way
Please just don't scare me
The path I've chosen is the right one
Let me know, since you're long gone
I ask myself are you my angel?
Am I on the path you intended for me to take?
Prepare me now, 'cause my very future is at stake
Please help me, my angel

(Chorus)

[Tony Tone]
You know time will reveal it
Tell the truth, so whatever's done in the dark shall come to the light
Everybody seems to lie on us, and that ain't right
Playa, better get your life together
Stay out of mine, 'cause in due time you'll find
That my life's at a rapid climb to the top
And I won't stop, and it ain't no fallin' off
I'm here to stay no matter what you say
So hate me, hate me 'til I'm in my grave, baby
Poetic's here, so how you feel?
I'm on the other side
God works in mysterious ways
Time has revealed
You might also like(Chorus)

[Boogy Nikke]
Come and feel the journey
Only time will reveal if you let time heal your wound
They say what goes around always come back around
And around, but if you do it right, nothin' can touch us
?, if all them bustas, time gon' pin it
'Cause I never did feel it, you so-called soldiers
Comin' from around and get erased from your trunk
Partner, be watchin' and waitin', anticipatin' your move
Get loose if you want to
You know who rules
We do, Mo Thug - we soldiers for the Lord, not you

(Chorus)
