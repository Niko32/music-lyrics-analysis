We've been friends for a long long time
You tell me your secrets and I tell you mine
She's left you all alone and you feel like no one cares
But I have never failed you,  I've always been there

[Verse 2: Steve]
You tell your story, it sounds a bit like mine
It's the same old situation it happens every time
Can't we see oh maybe you and me
Is what's meant to be
Or do we disagree

[Chorus]
[Anita]
What if I told you
[Steve]
What if I said
[Both]
That I love you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do
Do we dare to cross that line
Between your heart and mine
[Anita]
Or would I lose a friend
[Steve]
Or find a love that would never end
[Both]
What if I said
You might also like[Verse 3]
[Anita]
She doesn't love you
Oh it's plain to see
I can read between the lines of what you're telling me
[Steve]
He doesn't hold you the way a woman should be held
How long can I go on keeping these feelings to myself

[Chorus]
[Anita]
So what if I told you
[Steve]
What if I said
[Both]
That I love you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do
Do we dare to cross that line
Between your heart and mine
[Anita]
Or would I lose a friend
[Steve]
Or find a love that would never end
[Both]
What if I said
[Bridge]
[Both]
Oh we've both had our share of loneliness
[Anita]
So who's to say that we can't have a little happiness
[Steve]
And if I found that in you
[Anita]
It would make my dreams come true
[Steve]
Or would you walk away
[Anita]
Hear what I have to say

[Chorus]
[Anita]
What if I told you
[Steve]
What if I said
[Both]
That I love you
How would you feel
What would you think
What would we do

[Instrumental break]
[Chorus resumes]
[Both]
Oh do we dare to cross that line
[Anita]
Between your heart and mine
[Steve]
I've always wondered
From that day that we met
[Anita]
What if I said

[Tag]
[Steve]
What if I said
[Both]
Ohhh ooh
What if I said
