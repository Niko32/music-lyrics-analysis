Made me love you; now your man has come
You made me love you; now your man has come

I'm goin' away, baby; I won't be back till fall, Lord, Lord, Lord
Goin' away, baby; won't be back till fall
If I find me a good gal, won't be back at all

I'm gonna buy me a pistol, just as long as I am tall, Lord, Lord, Lord
Shoot my gal and catch a cannonball
If she won't have me, she won't have no man at all

See See Rider, where did you stay last night? Lord, Lord, Lord
Your shoes ain't buttoned and your clothes don't fit you right
You didn't come home till the sun was shining brightYou might also like
