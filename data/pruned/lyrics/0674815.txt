I mean you gotta ask yourself like what do you want out of this life
You only get one of them right? You want money wanna be famous, everything
The American Dream


[Verse 1:JOHNNY JC]

Imagine living life out of a movie scene
Sipping Hennesy next to the girl of your dreams
Money coming at you in every direction
All the weed comes free you can quit the stressing
Tour life, spot lights, ignite
The flame inside my heart that wanted it from the start
Fuck a nine to five I need to feel alive
That's why i'm chasing my dreams until the day that I die
When that casket closes I'll be one of the dopest
You know this middle fingers up the posers
I worked hard for this shit right here
Can't wait till I make the freshman of the year
JC about to be a household name
Voice of a generation like Kurt Cobain
But it's not what it seems
Living the American Dream

[Chorus x2: JOHNNY JC]
You might also likeNow put your hands to the sky
If you gotta dream that you follow
Gotta make it yours
Were not promised tomorrow


[Verse 2: JOHNNY JC]

We all want that life of luxury
Girls now fuck with me
Stay true to you to screw conformity
Real fans love for you the shit you put out
Not for the dough that you got
Or the gold in your mouth
Money don't make the man,man make the money
Giv'em a lil chance just taste all the honey
Because life is sweet now living on the beach now
Freestyle ain't free you gotta pay a fee now
25 K for a show
You can recall the last time you were broke
Seems like every week you buying a new boat
But it's better paying your bills tryna stay afloat
If that's what it is let me know
Living stress free inside of a big home
But i'd rather be broke than rich and alone

[Chorus x2: JOHNNY JC]

Now put your hands to the sky
If you gotta dream that you follow
Gotta make it yours
Were not promised tomorrow
