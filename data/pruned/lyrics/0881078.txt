Walking down the stairs
'Do you mind if I join you?'
'No, I don't care.'

Well maybe this could turn out really great
Or a big mistake
A mistake
A big mistake

When you told me I was second rate
I knew I'd met my fate
'Why don't you come over here
Where we will wash your feet?'
'Should I turn out the lights?'
'Well you can do as you please.'

An uncertain kiss
On a mouth of styrofoam
A taxi fee home and an incorrect phone
And when I awoke, I'm always alone

*A dream of love is haunting me
A dream of love is taunting me
