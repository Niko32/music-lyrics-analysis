Yeah
You know it's funny
The more things change, the more they stay the same
I'm sittin', watchin' these things around me
People doubtin' me, people questionin' me
But everything's fallin' into place
Yeah, everything in time, feel me?

[Chorus]
Never thought I'd be this fly, what? Never thought I'd be this tight, what?
Never thought I'd have my time, what? Never thought you'd hear me rhyme, but
Everybody wanna a piece of my cut, that record deal got signed, what?
It's a trip how people change, in this game, but I'm still the same
Never thought I'd be this fly, what? Never thought I'd be this tight, what?
Never thought I'd have my time, what? Never thought you'd hear me rhyme, but
Everybody wanna a piece of my cut, that record deal got signed, what?
It's a trip how people change, in this game, but I'm still the same

[Verse 1]
Never caught behind, two steps of the mind, why I can't bring that dollar decline
Flipped it last time, got it to wind, script it, that time, got ya mind
Boys wasn't with it, had to recline, laid back, fade back plenty of times
Tomboy filled with plenty of rhymes, back then, niggas never called me fine
One of the guys that's hard to see, roughed up, stuffed up, never to see
Right now, baby, would've never believed, back then niggas weren't checkin' for me
Little girl, curls, that was me, little world, swirls, that was me
Drama unfurl, that was me, drama from girls, that was me
Scrawny little thing, as a child, me and lil' Chuck, runnin' wild
Me called names? Tried to allow, gotta be somethin' that was vile
Wide eyed, cried, take it and blow 'em, star-eyed, cried, wiped my nose
Flip that, start lookin' for shows, spit that, time happen to go
Only the girl on the block, runnin' with boys, only girl got Stick McCoy
Had a little crush, name was Troy, got a little rush, loved the joy
Spent adolescent tryin' to get down, spent 22, wearin' a frown
Steady comin' up, wonderin' how, never been as fly, so look at me now

Never thought I'd be this fly, what? Never thought I'd be this tight, what?
Never thought I'd have my time, what? Never thought you'd hear me rhyme, but
Everybody wanna a piece of my cut, that record deal got signed, what?
It's a trip how people change, in this game, but I'm still the same
Never thought I'd be this fly, what? Never thought I'd be this tight, what?
Never thought I'd have my time, what? Never thought you'd hear me rhyme, but
Everybody wanna a piece of my cut, that record deal got signed, what?
It's a trip how people change, in this game, but I'm still the same

[Verse 2]
Started growin' up, started to bloom, seen if everything changed after the storm
E-lay C-lay quarter to noon, write more, fight more, stay in the room
Gettin' with the wrong guy, never again, get it from the wrong guy, never a friend
Try to go the straight road, tryin' to end, low self esteem, feels tryin' to mend
Niggas try to see me, never before, bitches wanna be me, never before
Niggas that would diss me, tryin' to score, bitches now jealous, callin' me whore
Heard game, ran game, many of lines, got played, got laid many of times
Crushed inhibition, lookin' for signs, love didn't live here then it was blind

[Chorus]
Never thought I'd be this fly, what? Never thought I'd be this tight, what?
Never thought I'd have my time, what? Never thought you'd hear me rhyme, but
Everybody wanna a piece of my cut, that record deal got signed, what?
It's a trip how people change, in this game, but I'm still the same
Never thought I'd be this fly, what? Never thought I'd be this tight, what?
Never thought I'd have my time, what? Never thought you'd hear me rhyme, but
Everybody wanna a piece of my cut, that record deal got signed, what?
It's a trip how people change, in this game, but I'm still the same
[Verse 3]
"Who's she?" Everybody askin' me, "Who's she?" Everybody ask to see
Who, me? Everybody tryna be, game ain't never been a thing to me
Was broke, now I tote plenty of G's, got mad gear with L of V
Need be my love and it's sweet, feathers in my hair, real Puerto Ric'
Came up, had lots of luck, came up, heads like destruct
Write more, no gettin' stuck, write more, then make a buck
Bitch can't be hurt, doin' my thing? Been that shit, heard runnin' schemes
Now I'm the hottest thing on the scene, straight line, got mine, know what I mean?
Keep it on top, my parade, hope it don't fly, masquerade
Myself from them days of play, stories like this that I relate
Hopin' that, don't start to slip, hopin' that, can keep a grip
Write rhymes that I can flip, motherfuckin' business, it's a trip
Learned that life ain't a game, passed up, passed by, it's a shame
Nothin' in life stayin' the same, time go by, things have changed
Look up, look by, it remains, still be sittin' and still complain
Gold digger's dreamed of a full tank, look up for the sky, say my name

[Chorus]
Never thought I'd be this fly, what? Never thought I'd be this tight, what?
Never thought I'd have my time, what? Never thought you'd hear me rhyme, but
Everybody wanna a piece of my cut, that record deal got signed, what?
It's a trip how people change, in this game, but I'm still the same
Never thought I'd be this fly, what? Never thought I'd be this tight, what?
Never thought I'd have my time, what? Never thought you'd hear me rhyme, but
Everybody wanna a piece of my cut, that record deal got signed, what?
It's a trip how people change, in this game, but I'm still the same
