It's never what you do but how it's done
What you base your happiness around? Material, women, and large paper
That means you inferior, not major
No idea's original, the Interlude's coming so run
Little something knew it was been done
How you base these rappers is around
Some of them, really I don't feel
Them niggas is fraudulent not real

My dark thought drowned out by white noise
As night falls upon them turn the corners try to make the right choice
Voice in my head telling me chill
Instead I listen to the horrors don't allow me to feel none
Only God can judge so why bother
I rather die a martyr than peace offer
I respect Martin but how long can you turn the other cheek
Before wanting to let it off clear the fucking street
The meek inherit the Earth, the weak perish in dirt
The beef settles when them shells is returned
Quite clear when the devil emerge, in sheep's clothing
We go and greet them with our arms open
Palm readers read our horoscope and, I can go and quote them
You was meant to be our leader speaking from a podium
The audience hear the audio in the auditorium
Start applauding Like game seven fourth quarter
And chip is on the line, home team is up
Throw the ball up in the air when the whole thing is won
You think it far fetched, when there's no doubt I could
I feel like Artest, I just want to shout the hood
Remember when it was about [?] and leather
Car shows we was bagging numbers
Graduated high school became a man in a matter of seconds
No cash just swag and a necklace
On my own like that old Patti record
Went in a survivor mode, and gladly accept it
Now I'm the shit in the septic
Skinny nigga throwing it up anorexic
Poor haters behind the goal like a heckler
Ask for no favors so labels owe me extra
Sex, drugs and rap music, club bathrooms
Where all the girls standing in line to vacuum shit
Last few sips of Henne Black I be smacked
At the table relaxed just waiting to take something back
Nights like this, I wish raindrops would fall
As Eddie Kane sing along
The fame and the fortune could have came and gone
Entertainers get lost and then their names dissolve
Can't fathom falling off from my heart of hearts
I'm the last dragon still looking for lover charmsYou might also like
