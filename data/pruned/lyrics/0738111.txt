I'd give you a true word, but you've already had one
If you were a bluebird, you'd be crying
You'd be flying home

If you were a raindrop, you'd shine like a rainbow
And if you were a train stop, the conductor would sing low
If you were a raindrop, you'd be falling
You'd be calling home

If you were a hotel, honey, you'd be a grand one
But if you hit a slow spell, do you think you could stand one?
If you were a hotel, well I'd lean on your doorbell
I'd call you my home

If I was a highway, I'd stretch alongside you
I'd help you pass by ways that had dissatisfied you
If I was a highway, well I'd be stretching
I'd be fetching you homeYou might also like
