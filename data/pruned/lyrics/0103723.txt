Back to sin again, must be fate
The wait was all day
Black acts to amend at the gate
Awaiting to taste

Something perished past and gone away
And nothing ever lasts that hesitates

[Chorus]
Cause I know
These days are calling out
The symbol sets in the red skyline
These days they call the wind is warm
Season of the wake
These days are callin out
The ship is leaving the silent bay
We set the sail a gift is born
Season of the way

[Verse 2]
Back from holiday in my head
The ocean calling
Magic in the grave at the end
The old way falling
You might also likeSomething calling asking to create
The only other lasting love to make

[Chorus]

Cause there's something within
There is something within, I'm awake
All my friends
There's something between
Because something within, I'm awake
You're all my friends
Alone, enough, awake


We've got a feeling of the day
Last time wasn't what we made but now we make a way
Love is our only true escape
Fearing nothing washed away the weight away the weight

Last time wasn't what we made but now we make a way
