Haul out the holly
Put up the tree before
My spirit falls again
Fill up the stocking
I may be rushing things but
Deck the halls again now

[MERCEDES with NEW DIRECTIONS]
For we need a little Christmas
Right this very minute
Candles in the window
Carols at the spinet
Yes, we need a little Christmas
Right this very minute
It hasn't snowed a single flurry
But Santa, dear we're in a hurry, so

[TINA with NEW DIRECTIONS]
Climb down the chimney
Put up the brightest string of
Lights I’ve ever seen
Slice up the fruitcake
It’s time we hung some tinsel
On that evergreen bough

Grown a little colder
Grown a little sadder
Grown a little older
And I need a little angel
Sitting on my shoulder
I need a little Christmas now

(Haul out the holly)
Well, once I taught you
All to live each living day
(Fill up the stockin)

It hasn't snowed a single flurry
But Santa, dear, we're in a hurry, so

Climb down the chimney
Its been a long time since
I've done the neighbourly

[TINA with MERCEDES]
Slice up the fruitcake
It's time we hung some tinsel
On that may-berry bough

[MERCEDES & TINA with NEW DIRECTIONS]

Right this very minute
Candles in the window
Carols at the spinet
And, we need a little Christmas
Right this very minute

We need a little Christmas now
