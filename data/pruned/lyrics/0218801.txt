You should be ashamed, I trust in you
Stealing kisses, someone's kisses
Starting a romance that wasn't meant for you

I begged and begged you to be careful
But you were always acting smart
You kept on
Stealing kisses, precious kisses
And suddenly you stole my heart

(Stealing kisses, precious kisses)
You should be ashamed I trusted you
(Stealing kisses, someone's kisses)
Starting a romance that wasn't meant for you
(I begged and begged you to be careful)
But you were always acting so smart

Stealing kisses, precious kisses
You should be ashamed, I trust in you
Stealing kisses, someone's kisses
Starting a romance that wasn't meant for you

But now I wish we never, never, never part
Stealing kisses, someone's kisses
And suddenly you stole my heartYou might also like
