I don't care really don't care
Am that fucker you'll find in this world baby nowhere
Ah nowhere

Starting to the end from first to last
I sacrifice everything in my whole past
The time that i waste & that i lost
I know i can't get it back at any cost
So now i have decided no more sacrifice
No more compromise

Diya hai mène bohat kurbaniya
Ab jiunga me apni asli duniya
Nachunga, khelunga, mauj-masti krunga
Mujhe parwaah nahi chahe do tum galiya
Ayyashi me karunga
Badmaashi me karunga
Tere liye na ladunga
Me apne liye jiunga

I don't care what the fuck you think about me
I don't care really don't care
Am that fucker you'll find in this world baby nowhere
Ah nowhere
You might also likeWhen you wanted me, i was there
When you called me, i was there
Every time i was there, i was there, i was there
But where you where when i needed you here
Longtime ago when i look myself in the mirror
I used to saw a very big winner
Fought for you, got caught for you
But the reality is that you were a betrayer
I was stupid, i was blind
You were torpid but mastermind
And that reminds me
I was actuly a loser not a winner
But hey baby, you know what?
THE GAME IS OVER

Badnaami se bhi me nhi darta
Tere jaise jhute waade me nhi karta
Tu keh de jo bhi kehna hai tujhe
Karunga wahi jo mera mann hai kehta
Suna gai mène abtak sab kuch teri
Ab kaan khol ke sunn le tu ye baat meri
Ki me hi hu raja aur me hi hu praja
Me hi hu inaam aur me hi hu saza
Ha me hi hu raja aur me hi hu praja
Me hi hu inaam aur me hi hu saza
