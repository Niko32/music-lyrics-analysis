If I was on my death bed
Your ruin is all that I would ask to have
My dying breath
Just one last wish

Wasting your breath before you see what I meant
I tread the path that leads to your discontent

Cruel admiration
Or heartfelt sedation?
You will not listen
A wasted condition

Where to begin?
When does it end?
My dying breath
Just one last wish
I tread the path that leads to your discontent

The end of failed corruption
Began to be mistaken
The method taken seemed to destroy his heart
Where to begin?
Where does it end?You might also like
