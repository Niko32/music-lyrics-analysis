Yeah, we're talking
Yeah, we're laughing
But we're feeling something else inside
Yeah, you're thinking
You're wanting, you're needing
I know 'cause it's written in your lies
It's you I despise

[Chorus]
And it's excellent
Oh yes, that's excellent
Love from evil and good-looking
So good-looking

[Verse 2]
Words deleting
Actions are repeating
Going 'round and 'round inside my mind
All of the time

[Chorus]
And it's excellent
Oh yes, that's excellent
Love from evil and good-looking
So good-looking
You might also like[Bridge]
This is love from evil
Taking love from evil
Making love from evil
And good-looking, so good-looking

[Chorus]
And it's excellent
Oh yes, that's excellent
Love from evil and good-looking
So good-looking

And it's excellent
Oh yes, that's excellent
Love from evil and good-looking
So good-looking
