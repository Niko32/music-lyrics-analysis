Sugar in my hair
Well I got a lot to tell you

I was in a dream that wouldn't wake me up
It must have been the sun
It must have been the sun

I forgot to laugh
At your joke
I forgot to hear
When you spoke

I forgot to give
And to get
I haven't really cared
Not quite yet

Light makes flowers in your eyes
And shows your smile
And you make me want to do the same

Kiss my freckled lips
And then my sunburnt skin
And then let me lie and dream again
Then let me lie and dream againYou might also like
