A triumph of tragedy
And all it claims from me
As those years recede
White lies are all I see
Missed steps and misgivings
Driven by fraility
What you call family
Feels so dead to me

[Chorus]
Nothing left to lose
When I'm losing you
Nothing left to lose
When I'm losing you

[Verse 1]
A triumph of tragedy
And all it claims from me
As those years recede
White lies are all I see
Missed steps and misgivings
Driven by fraility
What you call family
Feels so dead to me
You might also like[Chorus]
Nothing left to lose
When I'm losing you
Nothing left to lose
When I'm losing you

[Outro]
Losing the battle
And losing the war
Losing the battle
And losing the war
