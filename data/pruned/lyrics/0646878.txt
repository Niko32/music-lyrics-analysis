I try to crush it like the ashes of a cigarette
I try to smother out the embers, but I just can't quit
If there's a way to put it out, I haven't found it yet
Haven't found it yet

[Verse 2: Sara Evans & Isaac Slade]
It's like a habit, it's a craving running through my veins
It's an obsession, an addiction that I can't explain
If I give up everything, there's one thing that'll still remain
It'll never change

[Chorus: Sara Evans & Isaac Slade]
'Cause I can't stop
No, I can't stop
No, I can't stop loving you

[Verse 3: Isaac Slade]
I try to pour it out like whiskey running down the drain
It's like trying to empty out a river in an endless rain
I've just accepted that resisting is a losing game
There's no other way

[Chorus: Sara Evans & Isaac Slade]
'Cause I can't stop
No, I can't stop
No, I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
I can't, I can't, I can't
Baby, even if I wanted to
You might also like[Breakdown: Sara Evans & Isaac Slade]
I can't stop
No, I can't stop
No, I can't stop

[Chorus: Sara Evans & Isaac Slade]
I can't stop
No, I can't stop
No, I can't stop loving you
I can't stop
No, I can't stop
No, I can't stop
No, I can't stop
No, I can't stop
No, I can't stop loving you
