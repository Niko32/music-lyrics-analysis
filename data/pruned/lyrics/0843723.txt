Girl, just look at
You oughta know by now, baby
Oh girl

[Verse 1: Eric Williams]
What's wrong, sugar?
Can't you see?
Can't you see that I'm dependent of what we've been through?
Please don't cry, don't you know
I'd walked deepest waters forever for you
Girl, understand, I'm one man
That you would not lose
Don't give up just because
Because whenever your confused
Babyd just look at

[Chorus: Blackstreet & (Eric Williams)]
Look in the water (Ooh)
And see through yourself (See for yourself)
Look in the water and see (As my love pours)
Look in the water
And see for yourself (I'm here for you)
Look in the water and see (Girl, I am yours)
I'm yours (Baby, you know)
I'm yours
I'm yours
I'm yours
(Yeah, Chauncey, help me sing)

Oh, you make me so, so, so, so happy
'Cause when I'm with you, it's like Valentine's Day
Please don't cry, please don't, sugar
Tell me, why would I throw something like this so good away?
Girl, understand, I'm one man
That you would never lose
Don't give up just because
Because whenever you're confused, baby, just look

[Chorus: Blackstreet & (Chauncey "Black" Hannibal)]
Look in the water (Oh yeah)
And see through yourself (See for yourself)
Look in the water and see (As my love pours)
Look in the water
And see for yourself (I'm here for you)
Look in the water and see (Girl, I am yours)
I'm yours (Baby, you know)
