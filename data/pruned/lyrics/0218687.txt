The blues walked in this morning
And circled round my lonely room
I didn't know why I had
That sad and lonely feeling
'till my baby called and said it's through
Yesterday I sang a love song
But today I sing the blues

I know the explanation
But that's no constellation
No matter how your love
You can lose
And since I lost
I rather walk around and worry
I guess I've walked the darkest avenue

Yesterday I sang a love song
But today I sing the blues
Now it strikes me kind of funny
How life can be this way
We were lovers last night honey
But not in love today
Now it strikes me kind of funny
How faith can be unfair
It seems that I'm the one
To lose in every love affair
Yes it must be written for me
That I should be the one to always lose
Yesterday I sang a love song
But today I sing the blues

Yes it must be written for me
That I should be the one to always lose
