Let me drown easy water wash away my sins
And it feels like mercy it feels like faith
I'm losing my way

If I wasn't so lost would you toss me away?
Without a care or word to say two tongues get in the way
Bring me 'round quickly before the big one gets away
Lost and found maybe but the searching never ends

Stand tall like a mountain
Keep your feet on the ground
Stay true to the dream

Blind man says that faith will make it all right
If it's just the same I'll keep my sight, oh
If I wasn't so lost would you leave me on my own?
If it's just the same I'll keep my soul, ohYou might also like
