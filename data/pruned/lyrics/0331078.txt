Pastor Dave, on the fucking track
Run up in your crib, all i see is black
Let the AK rip, all i see is flash
Empty the fucking clip, in your fucking back
All i hear is shell casings hitting the ground
Grab all your stacks double back for another round
Do not fuck with me, I'm a different entity
I've seen shit that if you seen it you'd change your identity
My right will knock your teeth out, call it fucking dentistry
You cats shaking shivering pussy's from my intensity
Pastor Dave gone give these thirst hoes some holy water, makes them only smarter

[Verse 4: Pastor Dave]
I rip up every track ill ever fucking touch
I'll hit you with an uppercut that'll rupture your fucking gut
I'll roll up on you and your team like a fucking dutch
Empty the clip, pull off and hit the motherfucking clutch
Pull up clean to my mommas house without a fucking smudge
And if you somehow survived you'd be holding a fucking grudge
Hoping around on one foot without your motherfucking crutch
You'd come at me, put a bullet in you leave you dieing in the mud
Dave ain't no one to fuck with
Grew up with some fuck kids
Fucked around with fuck kids
Put them in the buckets
That dude still ain't nothing
That dude is still bluffing
He ain't about that gunning
He's about that running
Nah I can't fuck with him he gets beer muscles when he drinks
He's as fake as the bitches that take pictures on the bathroom sink
I'm trying to make these fake motherfuckers extinct
But its hard when they all look the same, they ain't distinct
Maybe its the way they walk or maybe its they stink
It's hard to tell the difference like all 90 billion chinks
But I'm trying to do my best to leave all these motherfuckers pink
And if you say you'll survive that's a motherfucking jinx
I'm running round town with a shotty like John Gotti
Pull up to your party with an empty bottle of Bacardi
Put a buckshot into Sparky, that's your nice little doggy
You start getting cocky, and started speaking malarkey
I said shut the fuck up before I hit you with the butt of my gun
You fucked with me, the shits up you son of gun
I don't give a fuck if hiccups were the sound of my gun
The sound of you peeing would be the sound of your red rum, bitchYou might also like
