If I should leave you
Try to remember the good times
Warm days filled with sunshine
And just a little bit of rain
And just a little bit of rain

[Verse 2]
And if you look back
Try to forget the bad times
Lonely blue and sad times
And just a little bit of rain
And just a little bit of rain

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
And if I look back
I'll remember all the good times
Warm days filled with sunshine
And just a little bit of rain
And just a little bit of rainYou might also like
