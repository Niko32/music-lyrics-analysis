Lying there beside me
With your head resting on my arm
Your body feels so warm
And your hair smells
Like a Sunday morning

[Verse 2]
I feel you moving closer
And I know what you're gonna say
But girl there's just no way
I'll ever like what you'll be saying

[Chorus]
Don't tell me goodnight
It makes me feel so empty inside
And if only I could
I wouldn't sleep at all
Don't tell me goodnight
Just let me drift off slowly away
And dream of you

[Verse 2]
You reach out and you touch me
Just to let me know you're there
And I can feel your hair
And somehow I don't
Feel like sleeping
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't tell me goodnight
It makes me feel so empty inside
And if only I could
I wouldn't sleep at all
Don't tell me goodnight
Just let me drift off slowly away
And dream of you

[Outro]
(Don't tell me goodnight) No, don't tell me goodnight
(Don't tell me goodnight) Don't tell me goodnight
(Don't tell me goodnight) Don't tell me goodnight
(Don't tell me goodnight) Don't tell me goodnight
(Don't tell me goodnight) Don't tell me goodnight
(Don't tell me goodnight) Don't tell me goodnight
(Don't tell me goodnight)
(Don't tell me goodnight)
(Don't tell me goodnight)
(Don't tell me goodnight)
(Don't tell me goodnight)
