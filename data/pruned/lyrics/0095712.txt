Maybe this decision was a mistake
You probably don't care what I have to say
But it's been heavy on my mind for months now
Guess I'm trying to clear some mental space
I would love to talk to you in person
But I understand why that can't be
I'll leave you alone for good, I promise
If you answer this one question for me

[Hook]
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?

[Verse 2]
First off, let me say "congratulations"
Heard that you just had a baby girl
If she looks anything like her mother
She's the prettiest thing in the world
Swear that I'm not trying to start no trouble
Tell your fiance he can relax
I'll leave you alone for good, I promise
There's a question I just got to ask
You might also like[Hook]
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?

[Bridge]
I know what we have is dead and gone
Too many times I made you cry
And I don't mean to interrupt your life
I just wonder, do I ever cross your mind?

[Hook]
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?
I just wonder
Do you ever
Think of me anymore
Do you?
