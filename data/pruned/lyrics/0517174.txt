Dressed up from head to toe, to get by
It seems once again, I forgot what keeps me safe and dry
And to the weepy windowpanes, that are dripping with dew
I can hear the rain outside, falling from the sky
And you can hear the...

[Chorus]
Pitter patter on the rooftop
You can listen to the rhythm of the raindrops
I wish that the sun would come and stay
This is a song for rainy days

[Verse 2]
Let's go dance around in the rain
Don't pay any attention to the people staring from inside
We'll leave all our cares behind
And you can hear it the...

[Chorus]
Pitter patter on the rooftop
You can listen to the rhythm of the raindrops
I wish that the sun would come and stay
This is a song for rainy days

And I know once the clouds shed their tears
I know that I'll be okay
I know that I'll be okay
You might also likeEven if the rain always wins
And forces my eyes shut, to dream of
I'll still dream of brighter days

[Chorus]
Pitter patter on the rooftop
You can listen to the rhythm of the raindrops
I wish that the sun would come and stay
This is a song for rainy days
