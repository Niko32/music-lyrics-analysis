Now trouble seems to fit him like a glove
First come, first served, he's serving it back
Travels light, without a pack, without love

He comes from nowhere, returns on his own
Late for the hanging, yes, he's heading for the moon
Hang 'em high

Leather across his thighs
Blasting out the night, he's terrified to drive
One eye on the road, crashed upon his head
One ear to the ground, he's listening to the dead

He comes from nowhere, returns on his own
Late for the hanging, yes, he's heading for the moon
Hang 'em high

Alone to himself, he's laughing up his sleeve
Looking back in anger, the city is relieved
Vision of light
Child of the night
Passing by

You might also likeAlone to himself, he's laughing up his sleeve
Looking back in anger, the city is relieved
Vision of light
Child of the night
Passing by

Leather 'cross his thighs
Blasting out the night, his cap hides his eyes
One eye on the road, price upon his head
One ear to the ground, he's listening to the dead

He comes from nowhere, and he turns on his own
Late for the hangin', yes, he's headed for the moon
Hang 'em high
