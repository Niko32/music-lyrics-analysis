Western stars light up the sky
Hear the desert wind roll by
Tonight, tonight

[Verse]
Western stars can break your heart
They keep shinin' when we're apart
Tonight, tonight
I watch, I wait
How long will my heart ache?
Tonight, oh tonight
I watch, I wait
My heart is bound to break
Tonight
Western stars light up the sky
Tonight, I'm alone to cry
Tonight

[Outro]
I watch, I wait
My heart is bound to break
Tonight
Western stars light up the sky
Hear the desert wind roll by
Tonight, tonight
Tonight, tonightYou might also like
