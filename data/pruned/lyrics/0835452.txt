I embrace all the tranquility
Night fishin' under the southern sky
I feel the north wind
I hear the earth sigh

White lightnin', drink of the southern man
Lord knows I never get enough of them
Be hard pressed to find a workin' man
Livin' for his time, well he's goddamned

(chorus)
Gone up the creek
Y'all ain't gonna find me
I be by myself
I live for no one else

My footsteps of vindication, my life bleeds stimulation
My soul, is the driving force, of these limited times
I make this life mine

Feel the water rush, I feel the moon rise
Cast the line, look up into the sky
Isolated from the chains of modern man
Look at your life, son
It's a fuckin' sham
You might also like(chorus)

(Repeat 1st verse)
