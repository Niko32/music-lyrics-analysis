Don't go on lightly
Don't leave me here
I wither quickly in winter's cold
But carry onward like I was told

And I wait for a sign

Like blood in the tears of all my enemies
(So they will see)
Knowing the pain the way they should
Blood in the tears of all my enemies
(Given to me)
Leaving a trail to where you stood

And when it's quiet
When you can hear
I beg you take me away from here

Like blood in the tears of all my enemies
(So they will see)
Knowing the pain the way they should
Blood in the tears of all my enemies
(Given to me)
Leaving a trail to where you stood
You might also likeCleansing red, wake the dead

Like blood in the tears of all my enemies
(So they will see)
Knowing the pain the way they should
Blood in the tears of all my enemies
(Given to me)
Leaving a trail to where you stood
