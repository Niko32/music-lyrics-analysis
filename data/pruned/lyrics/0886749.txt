You need more time but the curtain drops
Hanging by a thread end of your rope you find hope
You fall just short of the finish line
Just like you've done time after time
And all that's left to lift you is your faith
You find grace
Raise your eyes so you can see
You're right where you're supposed to be
It's dark so you can see the light
And it's hard so you can know it's right
And rain, nothing ever grows without you
Didn't think that the sun would rise
I kept confusing the truth with lies
Something told me I could not let go now I know
And holding on is gonna see you through
So go don't let go no matter what you do
Love through the anger, love through the pain
Love through the storm and love through the rain
It's dark so you can see the light
And it's hard so you can know it's right
And pain nothing ever grows without you
And hurt is just a chance to heal
And tears are just a call to feel
And pain, beauty's just a word without you
Beauty's just a word without you
And the sun is breaking through the clouds
Can you feel it shining on you now
You were lost and now you are found
And don't forget no don't forgetYou might also like
