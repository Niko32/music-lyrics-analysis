You sir, you're untouchable and
You sir, you're unstoppable
Outrageously ambiguous
Knee-deep and ridiculous

Let's save some face and fool ourselves
Let's save some face and fool ourselves

[Verse 2]
You sir, you're indispensable and
You sir, you're indestructible
"I is what I ain't" they say
And you can't have it any other way

Let's save some face and fool ourselves
Let's save some face and fool ourselves

[Chorus](x2)
Big yourself up, it's all the rage
Hush your mouth, act your age
I know it's good but I'm playing it down

[Verse 3]
You sir, you're the things that I hate
You're the things that I hate and
You're so disposable and
You sir, you're so accessible
'Sir' is the narrator here
He's hissing battle plans in my ear:
You might also like"Just save some face and fool yourself"
"Just save some face and fool yourself"

[Chorus](x2)
Big yourself up, it's all the rage
Hush your mouth, act your age
I know it's good but I'm playing it down
