It was just one star, far too far that made him turn away
Bland boy, no toy to a man like yourself
He was just no one, someone who needed something else
Time left room for me to reconsider
What had been winter and where the grass did grow
Time left room for me to reconsider, who and what I knew
And where that boy did go
First kiss: neither hit nor miss; it blurs from the quickness it keeps
First love: too much at once for that troubled boy to take
Blue lake, for sanity's sake he swam and dove too deep
Grey skies, green eyes - they change with the growing grass
Time left room for me to reconsider
What had been winter and where the grass did grow
Time left room for me to reconsider, who and what I knew
And where that boy did go
Loss of what is so precious
Confused with the scenery
A face with no name, a place without space
It's useless, boy don't you see
Time left room for me to reconsider
What had been winter and where the grass did grow
Time left room for me to reconsider, who and what I knew
And where that boy did go
No chance, no turning back, that lake is but a stream
One wish, one day for that kiss to return to those wanting lipsYou might also like
