I’m come around your team like a flashing mash and spit a coupla little men out of ya hat
Fill up your belly full of bangers and mash and attacking your team like an Afghan
Pap, pap, clap, clap, let’s see if you’re able to backchat
Can’t hear you blud you’re mumbling and Bruza brings the thunder in
And I’ll leave his meat with a puncture in and make him do a belly dance
Cave his stomach in and sweep his feet from under him
It’s Bruza Zulu warrior, warrioring you and your warriors, get me, get me
I came in the game, like have that
Cunt, you get me, have that
I’m in your face like a backhand slap
I stole your fame, now you’re like “hand it back”
Helpless with your hands to your back and handicap
You got caught by the handicapper, with your mate shot with his hands on his cap
This is the big Bruz, against me there’s no one to run to
I use tools and Bob’s your uncle, pap, pap, Bob’s your uncle
And Fanny’s your aunt, that’s what you get for ackin hard
Ack hard but I know you’re Fanny’s auntYou might also like
