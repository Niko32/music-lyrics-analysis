Have you seen her running 'round (have you seen her)
And the way she wears her hair (running 'round)
If you see her out tonight (have you seen her)
Tell her I don't care (running 'round)
Tell her I don't care (running 'round)

{Verse 2}
Have you heard she's coming down (have you seen her)
With every sickness in the air (running 'round)
If you see her out tonight (have you seen her)
Tell her I don't care (running 'round)
Tell her I don't care
Tell her I don't care (running 'round)
I don't care
I don't care

[Chorus]
Kumbaya
Kumbaya
Have you seen her
Let her know

[Bridge]
If you get alone, let her know that I don't really care
If you get alone, let her know that I don't really care
You might also like[Verse 1]
Have you seen her running 'round
And the way she wears her hair
If you see her out tonight
Tell her I don't care
Tell her I don't care
Tell her I don't care
Tell her I don't care
I don't care
I don't care

[Outro]
Kumbaya
Kumbaya
Kumbaya
