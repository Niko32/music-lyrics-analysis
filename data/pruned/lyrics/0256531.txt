[Verse 1: FreddyXL]

I dream everyday, tryna figure out a way
To put you in a mansion, your new home where you can stay
And never have to worry about bills u gotta pay
And everything that's stressin you jus go nd seems to fade away

A new benzo in the drive way
So whenever you feel like it, just go ahead and drive away
And whenever you feel like it, buy plane tickets and fly away
And it gotta be that 1st class
That's how u gettin' high today

In fact err'day, treat you like its your birthday
I became a grown man and still you say that I'm you baby
If u ever needin' anything, just call me up and say when
Our future lookin bright, even when we lookin through them ray benz

So never mind the past, 'cause it ain't coming back
And I promise you that I'mma make you proud and that's a fact
And I promise you that we gon make it out and that's a pack
Put it all on me, and we gone shine, and no matter what, I call you my....

'Cause you're my precious gold
If u didn't't know it know you do
Nobody shining like you do
'Cause you're my precious gold
Now you know it, now you know it
Now you know it, you're my...


[Verse2: Hip-naughtic Sean]

We met on a couple of occasion, and became friends
Soon after that, you became my girlfriend
Niggas hated it, but couldn't change that
They Still hating, 'cause I still own that

Lately shit is bad
But we working on that
They thought we were gonna end
But shit ain't never gon end
Compared to the rest
Girl you really been the best
I went from being a mess
To totally being blessed
A women worth some anger is certainly worth some effort
She always plays her part, I acknowledge her effort
She got beauty, body and brains oh lords she so perfect
Me and her together, oh boy that's just perfect

It makes hard to be faithful, when all these girls hala
But every single one of them got nothing on ya
I gave you my heart and you took good care of it
I'mmo get you anything, 'cause you're my Precious Gold
