Grind like I'm tryna get a billion but don't got a dolla'
Y'all ain't down to hit a juug I'll see y'all tomorrow
Pussy ass niggas, licking cause Im pit
Know some niggas locked doing years for that savage shit
Finesse finesse imma finneser
Plenty tecs u rest we eat the chest up
Set up my set in secs n then we pressure
Leaving moms upset inspect the measure
Of traces left behind
No the it's basics to this
If it's no face
Then I'm sure it's not no cases to this
Savages send packages
Leave you for the scavengers
It's snakes in the grass I know cause I hear em' rattling
Absurd you haven't heard I'm certified
Speech is slurred you can been sure it's syrup time
Juug then skurt was offered birds at certified
Plug in Sharon oh that's apparent you're sure to find
Then send em' out east push at the school
Take em' out to Shawnee I'm finessin there too
Don't forget about the licks everyone I'm tryna hit
Yeah it's true I got I job I'm all about my money bitch

[Chrous:Ha$ani]
Twisted ho u know I'm lifted
Two hits well shit then pass the spliff then
Got the smifin gang signs I twisting
SSS my click n I ain't switching
Slipping ho, give up the grip then
I ain't missing, gifted with precision
3 chicks equipped to stick this dick in
Can I live bitch well lemme live then

Selling thot never does peddle stop
On the block too hot for me set up shop
Good on gas y'all can stick to selling rocks
Propelling to the plug always 7 g's up in my sock it (socket) must of flew over your head
If she offering the cat
Imma still take that instead
Only fuck with white pussy cause u heard just what they said
Black pussy cross your path basically nigga u dead
"That's your baby hasan!"
That shit won't faze me lil mom
Kno that's fugazy
I'll stick wit Lindsays and Kaitys
Fucking all these bunnies strap up ion want the Rabbies
Member holes in my sock pockets looking slim shady
Strapped with the sack
Tokin blacks up in the hood
Always beef always heard "Backup blakka!" in the hood
Holice call for back up like that shit gone make it any good
Take a father from his child this all started with a juug
Still don't talk boys cause to me that's stranger danger
Neither firemen the Feds hell even a park ranger
Floating off the dank
Throwing up my middle finger saying "Fuck what u think."
Your Jane couldn't be plainer
[Chorus]
