愛はいらない、一人でいいの。
抱き締めないでよ！ (Uh Uh. No thank you)
25時 この甘いクス。
音もなく、ときめき加速する。
Don't need no one, no time for love
揺れ動く...

*Am I falling in love? I just can't stop
憧れてるだけ？そうじゃない！
Why can't I let it go? I'm not a fool for love!
だけど この気持ち 止まらない。
Am I falling in love? I gotta take control!
｢愛してる｣ なんてもう言わない。
Am I falling in love? But I don't know
愛なんていらないのに...

愛が足りない？
２人になれば、愚痴っぽくなるんでしょ？ (Uh Uh. No thank you)
どうして こんなに高鳴るの？誰か 教えてよ！？
Don't need no one, no time for love
それなのに...

*Am I falling in love? ....

恋だけじゃだめ みたい。
(Sometimes love just ain't enough. Will you still be down when it's rough?)
傷つくのが怖い。
(I tried to let this feeling go. It's too late now. My heart's already yours.)
あなたの近くに居たいの理屈じゃなくて、
繋がり合える 愛。

English:
There is no love, it is ok to be alone
Don't hug me! (Uh Uh. No thank you)
25 hours those sweet kisses
It's no sound but the knocking speeds up
Don't need no one, no time for love
I can't decide ...

* Am I falling in love? I just can't stop
Am I just longing for it? It's not so
Why can't I let it go? I'm not a fool for love!
But this feeling doesn't stop
Am I falling in love? I gotta take control!
I am not longer saying something like "I love you"
Am I falling in love? But I don't know
Even though there isn't something like love ...
Is love not worth it?
If we come together, wouldn't we start to complain? (Uh Uh. No thank you)
Why is it beating so fast? Can someone tell me that!?
Don't need no one, no time for love
Anyway ...

* Am I falling in love? ....

It seems only love is not good
(Sometimes love just ain't enough. Will you still be down when it's rough?)
I am scared of being hurt
(I tried to let this feeling go. It's too late now. My heart's already yours.)
There is no logic for "wanna being close to you"
It's love, that can connect us

* Am I falling in love? ....
