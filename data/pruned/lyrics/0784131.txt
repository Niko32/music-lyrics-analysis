[Verse 1]
You cannot be the same as me, girl, you know
You will find it works that way
You will find it works that way
There is no sayin' what is right, wrong, you know
But you don't like gettin' hurt
But you don't like gettin' hurt

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
"Why don't you stand right by my side?" said the man
"But don't look back, back at me
But don't look back, back at me"
"Protect yourself from all things bad," said the man
"Don't include me as being one
Don't include me as being one"

[Chorus]
Just as much as is good
I would like, if you would
Hey, you know, it's all right
Hey, you know, it's all right

You cannot be the same as me, girl, you know
You will find it works that way
You will find it works that way
There is no sayin' what is right, wrong, you know
But you don't like gettin' hurt
But you don't like gettin' hurt

[Chorus]
Just as much as is good
I would like, if you would
Hey, you know, it's all right
Hey, you know, it's all right

[Verse 4]
"Protect yourself from all things bad," said the man
"Don't include me as being one
Don't include me as being one"
