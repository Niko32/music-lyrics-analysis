There is no blues that can sound quite as heartfelt as mine
Lamented at the gorge of the river, I watched it weep its banks dry
I hum the sorriest tune on the bar at these dives
Send all the patrons running home to make up with their first wives

[Chorus: Tom, Kim & Rob]
But the low
And to bask
But the low
And to bask

[Verse 2: Gareth]
My prose is purple but not as pretty as Lucerne
For sweet nothings from the lips of a gargoyle, nobody ever yearned
Perpetually a philistine, but darling, I am longing to learn
Been looked at like the rotten grape on the vine
While you and yours are drinking Sauternes

[Chorus: Gareth, Tom, Kim & Rob]
(But the low) is what I came for
(And to bask) in a darkness I do adore
(But the low) is what I came for
(And to bask) in a darkness I do adore
(But the low) is what I came for
(And to bask) in a darkness I do adore
(But the low) is what I came for
(And to bask) in a darkness I do adore
(I do adore, I do adore, I do adore)

I am the magpie's solo, the sorrow that makes you salute
Pounding the earth for the early worm, I am a glutton but it's good for my glutes
I was solace to the sirens, the bait on the fisherman's rod
The hook took me far from my family, but closer to God

[Chorus: Gareth, Tom, Kim & Rob]
(But the low) is what I came for
(And to bask) in a darkness I do adore
(But the low) is what I came for
(And to bask) in a darkness I do adore
(But the low) is what I came for
(And to bask) in a darkness I do adore
(But the low) is what I came for
(And to bask) in a darkness I do adore
(But the low) But the low is what I came for
(And to bask) But the low is what I came here for
(But the low) But the low is what I came for
(And to bask) But the low is what I came here for
