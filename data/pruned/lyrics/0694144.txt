We both know the reason why you've called
So stop wasting time trying to soften up my fall
I know you want to sweeten up the taste
But if you don't mind, I'll just take my sorrow straight

[Verse]
You almost make it seem like something nice
The way you take your bad news and you pour it over ice
That's a kindness that I don't appreciate
Because I like to take my sorrow straight

[Verse]
I wouldn't say that I am any stronger than the rest
No matter what you say, it ain't gonna hurt me any less
'Cause in the end, there is really no escape
So I go on and I just take my sorrow straight

[Verse]
I wouldn't say that I am any stronger than the rest
No matter what you say, it ain't gonna hurt me any less
'Cause in the end, there is really no escape
So I go on and I just take my sorrow straightYou might also like
