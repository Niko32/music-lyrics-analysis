But i know it's not yes yes yes she does
Cause she doesn't treat me
Like you treat someone you love
You love

But i can choose my own family
I'll take one Uncle Phranc
She's seen what it is to feel and be called crazy
I love my Uncle Phranc

She told me if I go in the ocean
I've got to know it's the shark's world
She told me not to fuck with straight girls
She told me not to take pills, not to take pills

Take one Uncle Phranc
Take one Uncle Phranc

My mom says she loves me
But i don't think it's love
Cause she only loves me
When i act just like she does

And that's emotional blackmailYou might also like
