This song is about you
Cause I can't live without you
When a song is about you
Then you know you've got problems
That you can choose

[Verse 2]
There's a hole in my conscience
There's a hole in my country
Like a nose that keeps runnin'
Like a hose that won't stop flowin'
And I know that it's comin'
It's coming
It's coming
It's coming soon

[Bridge]
Here's why

[Chorus]
Cause you are the ocean
And I'm good at drownin'
You should be lookin' out
The mornin' will follow
And I won't remember
You should be lookin' out
It feels like I've been here
I've been here forever
You should be lookin' out
You should be lookin' out
You might also like[Verse 3]
In the fall I get lonely
In the winter I'm still lonely
Come the knives of the springtime
In the summer I go crazy

[Chorus]
Cause you are the ocean
And I'm good at drownin'
You should be lookin' out
The mornin' will follow
And I won't remember
You should be lookin' out
It feels like I've been here
I've been here forever
You should be lookin' out
You should be lookin' out
