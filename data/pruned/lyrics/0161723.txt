Wipe the knife and slice through another new head of iceberg
I serve more hors d'oeuvres to the trashcan
Than to any man where I work
Waste in this place is a terrible thing to mind, likewise time
And I’m sure stacking glasses in the back is a total waste of mine
But is it all just as small as it seems to be?
It’s obscene what the scenery costs when dreams are free

[Verse 2]
Sundays, she makes dates with inmates
And reads to each one from books
And when their fingers linger under big words
They give her dumb looks
She believes in Stephen
He's been writing an exciting piece of prose
Though only weeks from his release
And the police are patting down his clothes

But the long way is never the wrong way when it’s homeward
To be happy, yeah, if you ask me, is only a matter of homework

And it’s all in the, all in, all in the wrist
Care do not I you can words my twist
'Cause it’s easy, so easy that you might miss
And it’s all in the, all in, all in the wrist
Care do not I you can words my twist
'Cause it’s easy, so easy that you might miss
Care do not I you can words my twist
And it’s all in the, all in, all in the wrist
Care do not I you can words my twist
'Cause it’s easy, so easy that you might miss
Care do not I you can words my twist
And it’s all in the, all in, all in the wrist
Care do not I you can words my twist
'Cause it’s easy, so easy that you might miss
Care do not I you can words my twist

And everything I do seems useless
When everywhere I go is an uphill climb
Just wanna hear your voice one more time
Tell me you don’t miss me too now
I swear I’ll never figure you out
Why can’t I get the hang of this
If the truth fits on a floppy disk and it’s all in the wrist
