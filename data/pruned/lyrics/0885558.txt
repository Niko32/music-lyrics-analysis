Constantly amazed
By the blades of the fan on the ceiling
The clever little glances she gives me
Can't help but be appealing

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She loves to ride into town with the top down
Feel that warm breeze on her gentle skin
She is my next of kin

[Chorus 1]
I see a little more of me everyday
I catch a little more moustache turning gray
Your mother is the only other woman for me
Little Miss Magic, what you gonna be?

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I catch her dreamin'
And wonder where that little mind meanders
Is she strollin' 'long the shore
Or cruisin' o'er the broad Savannah?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know someday she'll learn to make up her own rhymes
Someday she's gonna learn how to fly
Oh, that I won't deny
You might also like[Chorus 2]
I catch a little more dialogue comin' my way
I see those big brown eyes just start to lookin' astray
Your mother's still the only other woman for me
Little Miss Magic, what you gonna be?

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Yes, she loves to ride into town with the top down
Feel that warm breeze on her gentle skin
She is my next of kin

[Verse 1]
Constantly amazed
By the blades of the fan on the ceiling
Those clever little looks she gives
Just can't help but be appealing

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I know someday she'll learn to make up her own rhymes
One day she's gonna learn how to fly
That I won't deny

[Chorus 1]
I see a little more of me everyday
I feel a little more moustache turning gray
Your mother's still the only other woman for me
Little Miss Magic, what you gonna be?
[Outro]
Little Miss Magic, what you gonna be?
Little Miss Magic, just can't wait to see
It's raining, It's pouring
Your old man is snoring
