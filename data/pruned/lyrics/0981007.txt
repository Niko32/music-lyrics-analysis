And if you like it, I could
Start again, let you in
I notice when
You leave your name
You know I like it when you
Sing a tune, call back soon
You let it fly (I told you so)
You ask me why (I let you know)
About the little things
I know make a difference to you
Maybe it's wrong, it feels all right
You know I like the way you
Ride your bike, stay the night
I think it's neat, I watch you eat
I like the way it falls
All over you, ooh, ooh, oohYou might also like
