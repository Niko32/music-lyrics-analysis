Nobody but you can cheer me
You left me alone, you wandered from home
Oh, why do you roam, my dearie?

You promised you'd be just mine, sweetheart
That you and I would never part
You've broken your vow and left me but now
I'll pray that somehow you'll return, sweetheart

If you only knew, my longing for you
That I am still true to you, dear
Perhaps you would say, "I'm sorry", someday
"That I went away from you, dear"

You promised you'd be just mine, sweetheart
That you and I would never part
You've broken your vow and left me but now
I'll pray that somehow you'll return, sweetheartYou might also like
