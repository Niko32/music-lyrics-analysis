A lifetime of disbelief is now shackled by its throat
For he never turned unto the gates but burned it down with earth
He ingests his wealth, contemplates the drain, his emerald soul
His grave will sleep warm of opulent eyeballs
And at the summoning grounds is the reunion where abundance is abound
Broken teeth are found in the bones and backs beyond the flesh of animals
And so began:
A filthy addiction
The price on life had begun to substitute
Thus he verbalized for every sad inhuman worth
Broken teeth are found in the bones and backs beyond the flesh of animals
And so began:
A filthy addiction
The price on life had begun to substitute
And so commenced the sick unholy glowing green addiction
Thy thirst to strip the forest keeps the world in cold affliction
Sunk its leaves of sustenance, drilling holes in all his teeth
Locked the spoils in their place
"Carry your grin between your greed"
Infinitely basking, is his chest displaced with gold?
The mountains have not piled yet, must he slit a robins throat?
The years will multiply and yet he never feels content with himself and now he turns to burn the garden of paradise
Nothing saves
Behold there is no gold that saves your soul
To quantify salvation is to be unborn
There is no price on life to be paid
Every man is his own savior
His basking is now met with an unfortunate realization
Of his heart solid gold failed on the stretchers congression
And so it had ended
Echoed forever, a filthy addictionYou might also like
