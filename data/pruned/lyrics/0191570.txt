I know that I surprised you coming home
It's not my usual time of year
But I've got myself a problem and I know
That I might find the answer here

[Verse 2]
Remember when I was dad's pride and joy and your little man?
Every time that I got hurt you were there to give a hand
You'd pick me up, and you'd kiss my hurt away
Remember what you'd say?
"Boy you are getting more like him each and every day."

[Pre-Chorus]
Can we have a talk like it was yesterday?
Your boy is back in trouble and he needs you right away

[Chorus]
She says she's going to leave me, mama
Nothing on God's green earth would make her stay
I can't live without her, mama
But this time you can't kiss the hurt away
But if I'm so much like my dad
There must have been times you felt her way
So tell me word for word what he said
That always made you stay
You might also like[Outro]
She says she's gonna leave me, mama
But if I'm so much like my dad
There must have been times you felt her way
So tell me word for word what he said
That always made you stay
