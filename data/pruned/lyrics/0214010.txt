Little boy you gon' get it enyukay like cold chili
Benefit from those who oppose livin souls wit holes
My doors locked ain't open or closed
My scene it, scenic, throw it up like a bulimic
On top of the world and I still ain't even seen it...
And its wit slight hilarity I think it's necessary
That we focus on the music not the style in which I vary
Dopamine flows when Im listenen to tunes ain't got to many shows rockin' joints around the room
Enyukay stayin' buttered like my biscuit, topshelf, til the day examined by forensic teams
Lets say a few words nouns covered in verbs me
I like to hover above ya Dre garnished wit herbs
And powder serves switch flip the power surge so Im feelin' pretty groovy like austin power's words
Smile happy got afterlife comin' mass laughter bite somethin' better yet buy you some funyuns
Got my energy focused soon to work to be the dopest
Squash out them cockaraches tell them haters buenos noches...
I dont need to toke i floats like sky boats
Gets inspired every day yeah Im readin' them fly quotes
And words from the wise knowledge from intelligence
I'll set them goals high for that positive benevolance ugh...
