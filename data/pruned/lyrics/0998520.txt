W t f?
Who called the cops why am I under arrest?
Is this your name tattooed on my chest?
Oh my hot, hot mess
Every, every, every single time
You pull me back down to the scene of the crime
Trouble never looked so goddamn fine
Oh my, oh my!

Here we go again
I've got a sin I really need to confess
Dirty little friend
I'm addicted to your madness
Come on give me some more
You're a disaster in a dress
Oh my hot, hot mess

Puttin' it puttin' it back together piece by piece
Took a bottle from the party and then blamed it on me
Got caught gettin naughty in your friend's
Back seat
Oh my, hot hot mess
It's killing me killing me I can't stop
Didn't mama always tell me to not get mixed up
With the pretty little girls who like to play rough?
Oh my oh my (oh my, oh my! )

Dirty little friend
I'm addicted to your madness

You're a disaster in a dress
Oh my hot, hot mess

So let us play with fire now
Some girls just wanna watch the world burn down
Wanna watch the world burn down
Wanna watch the world burn down
Here we go again!
Dirty little friend!
(I'm addicted to your madness)

Here we go again
