You don't seem to be doing all that bad
In fact you look good
You don't seem to be feeling all that sad
Like I thought maybe you would

[Chorus]
How, how did you do it?
How did you let it go?
How, how did you do it?
I need to know

[Verse 2]
Now you've got friends to help you when you're sad
There's even someone you've been seeing
Now, I know there's nothing wrong with that
In fact it's a good thing

[Chorus]
How, how did you do it?
How did you let it go?
How, how did you do it?
I need to know

[Verse 3]
One last question before you go
If you're really over you and me
How did you get there, I need to know
'Cause that's where I'd like to be
You might also like[Chorus]
How, how did you do it?
How did you let it go?
How, how did you do it?
I need to know
How, how did you do it?
How did you let it go?
How, how did you do it?
I need to know
