Alright
Make you wanna dance, don't it, baby?

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna wear my flip-flops and
I'm gonna play some flip-cup and
Rock a little bit of hip-hop and Haggard and Jagger
And throw a 20 on the corn hole game
[Album version:] If I'm lucky, yeah, I might get laid
[Single version:] If I'm lucky, yeah, I might get paid
The way that it's goin', the keg gon' be floatin'

[Chorus]
[Album version:]All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
[Single version:] All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and stay home
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on
Gettin' my sun daze on

[Verse 2]
Girl, you know you're the life of my party
You can stay and keep sippin' Bacardi
Stir it up as we turn on some Marley
If you want you can pet on my Harley
I sit you up on a kitchen sink
Stick the pink umbrella in your drink
The way that we're feelin', we gone by this evenin'
You might also like[Chorus]
[Album version:] All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
[Single version:] All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and stay home
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on
Gettin' my sun daze on
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
[Album version:] All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and get stoned
[Single version:] All I wanna do today is wear my favorite shades and stay home
Work a little less, play a little more
That's what this day is for
And all I wanna do is lace my J's and lace some Jack in my Coke
Work on my laid back, ain't nothin' wrong
With gettin' my sun daze on
Gettin' my sun daze on
