I been watching you watching me
I could feel your eyes from way across the room
But now that I'm holding you close, I can see
Ain't no way I'm gonna get around you
I won't tell you I don't need you tonight
I won't pretend I ain't burning inside
Your skin glowing soft in the silver moonlight
The shadows where the promises hide
The bittersweet taste of your kiss
It's all more than I can resist

[Chorus]
But if you're thinking about breaking my heart
You might as well just pick up your little black dress and go
Somebody else already tore it apart
And I thought you should know

[Verse 2]
Maybe this is all that you want
Maybe you're just as lonesome as me
A shoulder that you can cry on
And a warm safe place you can be
Someone to call in the middle of the night
When the ghosts in your bedroom won't rest
And two arms to hold you tight
I promise that I'll do my best
To give you everything I got to give
Keep your secrets as long as I live
You might also like[Chorus]
But if you're thinking about breaking my heart
You might as well just pick up your little black dress and go
Somebody else already tore it apart
And I thought you should know

But if you're thinking about breaking my heart
You might as well just pick up your little black dress and go
Somebody else already tore it apart
And I thought you should know

But if you're thinking about breaking my heart
You might as well just pick up your little black dress and go
Somebody else already tore it apart
And I thought you should know
