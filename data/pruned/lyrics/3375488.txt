Life taught me lessons
I have to learn
I played with fiya
And I got burned
I kissed your lips
Laid there in your bed
Now I'm stuck in your web

[Chorus]
I made a choice
I play the fool
And ever since that day, baby
My blood is blue
You cut me deep
And it’s flowing like a river, child
No, my blood is blue

[Verse 2]
You took my innocence
Made me as sturdy
Let me drink from the well of pleasure
Before you left me in the desert
I told you
Please, take it easy on me
But you kept going harder, and harder
You might also like[Chorus]
I made a choice
I play the fool
And ever since that day, baby
My blood is blue
You cut me deep
And it’s flowing like a river, child
My blood is blue

[Post-Chorus]
It's blue
Yes, it's blue
My blood is blue
Yeah

[Bridge]
You cut me real deep, baby
You cut me real deep, baby
You cut me real deep, baby
You cut me real deep, baby (yeah)
You cut me real deep, baby (You cut me real deep, baby)
You cut me so deep, baby
What did I do to deserve this kind of love?
(This kind of love)

[Chorus]
I made a choice
I play the fool
And ever since that day, baby
My blood is blue
You cut me deep
And it’s flowing like a river, child
No, my blood is blue
