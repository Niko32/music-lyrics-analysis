And outta the 9 girls I asked 2 out
They never worked out
And I silenced all my critics like the letter b in the doubt
SHABAZZ turn they women into hoes, word out
Tight ass flows like a couple virgin pussies
Reason why these fake broads never overlook me
Tight ass relationships with the GodFather
And I can't wait till RAE win her first Oscar
I ain't ever been one for that four letter word, So I gave up
Shots of that tequila and my white wine in the same cup
Thing is I can never be Rabbss J.Cole
Even though we both got the same phone
I got it good and you know
Ain't got no time on my hands except this Hublot
These days niggas got dirty minds full of dark things
They say BAZZ ain't fair, cos shizz nigga man's is dark skinned
A few steps I'm still trynna retrace
A few haters I'm still trynna embrace
But forget about me for a couple of seconds
ERA & RAE
Got that Cruk'dStr8 Mixtape, tied up like a shoelace
Young, Black and Gifted I just need to be left alone
My Face is known in Distant places but i feel quite distant from everyone i've known
And to make all these thirsty bitches happy I think I would need a bone-er
Thinking of going to college out in Atlanta
I was never raised in a hood where niggas came through with pimped cars and yellow bandanas
But my flow still so sharp it leave y'all with scarred faces, Tony Montana
Been f*cking around with a couple of students who say they's is dancers
I loved a woman that smokes weed guess you can say I got higher standards
Been fucked over so many times I'm starting to feel like a bitch on heat
I was raised with money by my side so I guess I'm a bitch on the streets
My tap runneth over
Flow so cold full of Iced-blocks
Louis V on my balls call that an Iced cock
They said they gon' sell you dreams my nigga dont believe it
They call me BAZZ and I know Victoria's Secret
And yeah they said Chief Keef be coolin wit his youngins call that GBE
I'm coolin wit my photogropher call that KDP
The same niggas I thought were my support system
Got the nerve to judge me like the f*cking court system
So fuck love
That shit is for niggas who respect strippers at the f*cking strip club
And I wrote this sipping on some Johnny Walker
And y'all don't even know the f*cking author
And I'm just another microsoft nigga, word
Pushing for what I deserve
And to any b*tch that broke my heart
Your finish line is where mine starts
And I'm contemplating on if love is really useless
A young girl took herself out my life and left me ruthless
And I'll never lie to you I'll tell you the truth first
Cos I know the truth hurts
Novocain all in my heart so I don't feel shit
Young East African Girl I hope you feel this

MAY ANGELS LEAVE YOU
AND THE DEVIL SEE YOU
MAY YOUR SINS CUT YOU
AND MAKE YOU BLEED TO
