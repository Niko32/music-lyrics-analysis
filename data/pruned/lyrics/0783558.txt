Lovin' you was my great sin
And I might take you back again

For a long time the world stood still
I loved you then and I always will
But to me you've been untrue
And there is nothing I can do

* Refrain

Well, here you're, you're back again
I know that I just can't win
You broke my heart most everyday
And now you'd best bo on your wayYou might also like
