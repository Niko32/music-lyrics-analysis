We could touch them
The night air is soft and still
The world has stopped turning
This moment in time
And your kiss is all that's real

Chorus:
And it's just like the first time I held you
This feeling is still oh so right
And if I didn't already love you
I'd fall in love tonight

The love that I feel goes unspoken
'Cause I see the same love in your eyes
So softly the twilight slips away
Come rest in my arms tonight

Repeat Chorus Twice

I'd fall in love tonightYou might also like
