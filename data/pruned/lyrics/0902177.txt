The way that you're treated only goes to show
That your popularity is in your head, it's in your head
No one came round to your house today
The phone doesn't ring, you think that's OK
It must be the weather, or they had to go and visit their grandmother instead

All your friends think you're a fuckhead
All your friends think you're shit
All your friends think you're a fuckhead
All your friends think you're shit

A good paranoia is what you lack
Your friends always talking behind your back
Of course it has nothing to do with the simple fact
That nothing you say is of any worth
There's always a challenge to see who leaves first
Someone should tell you but we're always too afraid, to say that

All your friends think you're a fuckhead
All your friends think you're shit
All your friends think you're a fuckhead
All your friends think you're shite
They're right

You thought that they were friends that you would never lose
Why, you're so charismatic when you're on the booze
Sometimes your friends behaviour is so difficult to excuse
To pay your bills on time, well that just wouldn't do
You don't take back your library books 'til they're overdue
It's the only way that you will ever get a letter to come to you

All your friends think you're a fuckhead
All your friends think you're shit
All your friends think you're a fuckhead
All your friends think you're shite
