Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you has gone, but the heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me free

[Verse]
Take these tears from my eyes so I can see
Just a spark of the love that used to be
If you love somebody new, let me find somebody too
Take these chains from my heart and set me free

[Verse]
Give my heart just a word of sympathy
Be as fair to my heart as you can be
Then if you no longer care for the love that's beating there
Take these chains from my heart and set me free

[Verse]
Take these chains from my heart and set me free
You've grown cold and no longer care for me
All my faith in you is gone, but my heartaches linger on
Take these chains from my heart and set me freeYou might also like
