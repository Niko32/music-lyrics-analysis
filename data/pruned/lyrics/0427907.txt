Add on and cast away the demon paramecium
Vexation and toil, bad apple exile fruition
Bad habits and stressed out superstition
Topple the opposite trick gate, false ego creatures disintegrate
Metropolis ixnay, non devotional to the cover up
Aliens surgeons killed the president with intelligent spores
Chain in command, supply and demand chain store

Contageous flaming lips cold sore blowing up
With this twin infinity style like royal trux
Celebrity justice double jeopardy, risking everything
Irrational and unaware international affair
Star making machinery lampoon you big dummy
Hollywood 23 skidoo this is the fuzzy logos cerebellum
Tranquility tau ceti material nature
And i'm just about ready to really face her

Vasocontrictor, stir the elixir
I concur, words that i whisper
With my tongue muscle, yo you dumb fucko
I hustle, bust your shit up on the humble
Jungle, whatever, i'm a legend in the making
Fuck a vendetta, your sentences i'm erasing
All emcees, poets, warriors, step up and face the challenge
You'll get served an ice cream cigarette salad
Sit down and write myself a nice little ballad
Or freestyle all night like it never even mattered
Nomadic photon magnetic twilight
Getting my flow on, having the hind sight
Of autumns past cosmonaut caloquial
Cardiac arrest baltimore oriole
Sequoia snowpeak flow speak on a broke beat
Slow leak on soul seek i dont eat

Detailed parable non-perishable antiquity
Blink and you miss it, pictorial mischeif

In accordance with the old earth
Divide the primordial void
Covert operations
