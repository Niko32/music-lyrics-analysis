Way down upon the old plantation
Old Massey used to own me as a slave
He had a yeller gal he called Lorena
And we courted where the wild bananas wave
For long years there we courted
And we were as happy as one
And my hard work for did Massey
And the happiness of life had just begun

[Chorus]
No more the moon shines on Lorena
As we'd sit and watched the coon among the corn
And the possum playing on the wild bananas
And the old owl a-hooting like a horn

[Verse 2]
One day I called to see my dear Lorena
I thought she would meet me at the gate
But they took her away to old Virginny
And left me to mourn for her fate
For years I had longed to see her
And the thoughts of her was ever in my head
One day Massey read me a letter
Telling me that Lorena she was dead
You might also like[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
But I know that her soul has gone to heaven
And there she is ever free from pain
And to her a brighter crown is given
And no more she will wear the darkie's chain

[Chorus]
