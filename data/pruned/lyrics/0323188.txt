"I'd like to ask my wife, June Carter to come back. Come here, June! I wonder, could we get Carl Perkins back out to help us with this tune too? June and I have been singing this song, our version of a John Sebastian song, "Darlin' Companion."

Darling companion, come on and give me understanding
And let me be your champion, a hand to hold your pretty hand in
Darling companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned
Love will always light our landing, I can depend on you

Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed
Oh, a little bridling down from you is what I need
Darling companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned
Love will always light our landing, I can depend on you

Darling companion, come on and give me understanding
As long as we keep laughing, bear in mind just what could happen
Darling companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm going to stick by you

Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed
Oh, a little bridling down from you is what I need
Darling companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned
Love will always light our landing : I can depend on you
You might also likeDarling companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gong to stick by you
