Hol' Up Hol up Milli Entertainment I'm Infinite

[Verse 1: Infinite]
Pretty boy swag ? No, real nigga rap
And I don't take naps get no where like that
PC under your hat under mine I got a Mac
And it run real fast without ever lookin back
Damn nigga see I go ham
See me give a fuck when hell freeze I prolly am
Not a second before, for me don't give a damn
But I hold the water back only reason cause I can
Man you can't run shit already ran
And I been a track star since the day I had a tan

Get it...Get it (haha) It don't matter you will soon enough

[Verse 2: Infinite]
But uh...
Lemme get back on full attack
As I kill a track and make powder outta crack
Hack slash through it do it that's a fact
Or a plan for the man understand who I am....King
And shit the light is what I bring
So roll another blunt to the right just isn't me
Puff puff pass it to the left to the left like Beyonce sing
But I can't So I just go in like a rant
And my pants saggin to the floor cause once again
I don't give damn
So that's two get it through your head
You ain't shit to M.E. Infinite it's Milli to infinity
Talkin shit thought you had offended me
But it's me on the offense simply
Cause I go in
On my khaled shit cause all I do is win
Rabid shit as I let the record spin I sin
Gotta eat my din'
Never on one cause I'm gettin on ten
New tracks, Songs flowin out the pen
Will it be a banger? Well that all depends
If you are a hater then prolly it won't be
That's all, Just later don't try to approach me
Cause you see this shit it's like I'm never choking
Like I don't need to breathe just inhale the weed
Until all I see is the dream that I dreamt for me
And my family cause insanity is what I plan to be
Jumpin crowds all fans of me
Cause I'm hot as shit try to cool me down
I said I'm king try to move the crown
You can't cause I rule it now
Give me an inch and I move a mile
Man I groove with style
Ima be the shit and that I knew for a while
Since I was a child....

Ima man now and that's hands down
Jump in the ocean cause I can't drown
No life preservers but right deserver
Cause I'm the server of this bam pow
That's a K.O. and that's O.K
All lights out like no day
Shit I'm out? That's no way
I'm all work hard that's no play
I got white boys that roll jays
Black boys on the swisher sweets
J.B. he a white boy but he black as shit if you ask me
So cut a dutch fill her up course I got the light no asKing
Two hits take two hits don't chief bitch get passing
A plus grade up I'm sick this a plague (ugh)
Catch the cold I'm just wreckin bold
You can't recognize what's that say huh?
Cause I'm real shit I just kill shit
I'm takin shots to a million plus a million plus a million
Till I feel rich keep illin
Keep droppin bombs I ain't never calm
I'll end your shit like dot com
Then embalm I'm not mom
But I'll punish you cause I'm dead wrong
Smalls is back Biggie Smalls is back
Lemme stop not sayin all of that
But I'm good cause my songs is crap
And that's a gamble and I'm a lucky chap
Throw sevens up no not exact
I got talent can't front that
So I sit back and I just rap
Listen Up can't switch facts
I just killed the beat rest in peace
Keep testin me like a CRES you see
Ima pass and don't have to cheat
Just have to eat I'm a hungry man
And I'm after feast movin faster feet
Meet no defeat you can't pastor me
Cause Ima beast of prey out the D[M]V
That's where I be that's where I stay
I said you'll see and I don't play
I need my seat
So I sit the hate you can keep
