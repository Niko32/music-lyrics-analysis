Shiny moon, big watching eye
Wine makes our laughter loud
You pour my glass full

I wear my tight pirate dress
But my smile looks innocent
I wonÂ´t let you notice my real intent

Getting closer
Bringing troubles
We're not supposed to play this game

Tempting thoughts
So hard to fight
While my mind loses control

Rays of blinding sun
Are leaking through my door
(wildfire wildfire)
Wildfire sparks just waiting for my nod
(wildfire hmm)

Walking, walking on the edge
Shaky ground beneath our feet
Did you see I left the place acting like a thief?
You might also likeJust a little step away
Do you know? I know you do
You keep talking
I play dumb, I play dumb

Getting closer
Bringing troubles
We're not supposed to play this game

Tempting thoughts
So hard to fight
While my mind loses control

Rays of blinding sun
Are leaking through my door
(wildfire wildfire)
Wildfire sparks just waiting for my nod
(wildfire hmm)

Teasing fascination
Knocking at my door
(wildfire wildfire)
Wildfire sparks just waiting for my nod
(wildfire hmm)

Waiting for my nod
Waiting for my nod
Rays of blinding sun
Are leaking through my door
Wildfire sparks just waiting for my nod
(wildfire hmm)

Teasing fascination
Knocking at my door
(wildfire wildfire)
Wildfire sparks just waiting for my nod
(wildfire hmm)

Waiting, waiting for my nod
Waiting for my nod
