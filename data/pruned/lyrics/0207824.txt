Mmm

[Verse 1]
We can't always both be right, we sometimes disagree
But you've got the right to speak your mind and it's the same with me
When the anger's at an end
And you want inside my arms again
All you have to do to make it right

[Chorus]
Touch your woman, touch your woman
Everything's going to be alright
Touch your woman, touch your woman
Let me know, let me know everything's alright

[Verse 2]
There are times when I should be strong when I'm awfully weak
When the sudden blows of life have brought me to my knees
Woman needs a helping hand
Needs someone to understand
Needs the man she loves to help her stand

[Chorus]
So touch your woman, touch your woman
Everything's going to be alright
Touch your woman, touch your woman
Let me know, let me know everything's alright

And when the busy day is done, you lay by my side
You know exactly what it takes to keep me satisfied
You know exactly what I need
And I always go to sleep in peace
Thanking God that you belong to me

[Chorus]
So touch your woman, touch your woman
Everything's going to be alright
Touch your woman, touch your woman
Let me know, let me know everything's alright

[Outro]
Mmm, touch your woman
Mmm
