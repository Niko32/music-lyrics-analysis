She always leaves a light on in back to tell him it's ok
They stand a lot to lose
If these midnight rendezvous
Should make the morning news

'Cause there's no secrets in a small town
Word gets around
You can't live it up if you can't live it down
In a small town

He's got this rebel reputation from another day
She wonders if they're seen together what would people say
They're thinkin' they're so discreet
But they're givin' off so much heat
And now it's on the street

'Cause there's no secrets in a small town
Word gets around
You can't live it up if you can't live it down
In a small town

There's a whole lot of good to be said
About a town of some small size
But you've got to live your life
As seen through pryin' eyes...
You might also likeNo matter how hard they've tried
This lovin' they've got inside
It's just too hard to hide

And there's no secrets in a small town
Word gets around
You can't live it up if you can't live it down
In a small town

No there's no secrets
There's just no secrets
No secrets in a small town
