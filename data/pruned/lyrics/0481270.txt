Feeling electric, lights all neon
Packed full of fun like a forty ounce juice box
Like dancing in your bedroom, dancing in your bedroom
Leave it behind me so no one can find me
Lights can blind me it's fine
Like Dancing in your bedroom, dancing in your bedroom

VERSE One
Fresh face like I'm quite new
Sometimes I pretend to be a cowboy
Quick draw when it's high noon
Click click bang bang take you down boy
White laces on my Sk8-Hi's
Want beef, but no steak tonight
I'm off meat stay incredible
Tell ma' I'm being good eating vegetables
Got my arms outstretched but they've
Gone done clipped one side of my wingspan
My lifes a scam never goes to plan
God's up looking down saying "God damn"
What? I'm on the map and I'm coasting
Did what I could tried to get them to notice
And I've been trying to make it for a long time
But timing is eveything I guess I'm in the wrong time

Forget the world, forget the world, forget the world

VERSE Two
Northside like a wild western
One on one first time confession
I've been sinning ever since I was young
Fuck trying to be good I was trying to have fun
I had girls on my mind and a high temperature
The other boys made fun of me I'm bad tempered
In grade three Mathew Picking on the colour of my skin
I made a fist from my hand, worth the trouble that I got in
I wrote my name on the side of a bin
To let them know that I been there
I'm on youtube learning magic so
So I can disappear through thin air
Like "Tada" Smooth like butter
Half impressed the other half can shut up
Losing my self letting everything blur like
Spinning in circles, spinning in circles
CHORUS
Feeling electric, lights all neon
Packed full of fun like a forty ounce juice box
Like dancing in your bedroom, dancing in your bedroom
Leave it behind me so no one can find me
Lights can blind me it's fine
Like Dancing in your bedroom, dancing in your bedroom

Forget the world, forget the world, forget the world
Forget the world, forget the world, forget the world
