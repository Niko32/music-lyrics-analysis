Swarms of people they move in every direction
Some eyes they wander while others are just glued to their feet
And how I wonder what goes on behind those eyes
There are lives, growing older and they're growing wise

[Verse 1]
So amazed by all the many different faces
Searching for traces of emotion wondering places they have been
And on occasion, someone will take a look at me
But do they see a unique person, or am I part of a vast sea

[Chorus]
Sing me your song, solve my mystery
I won't do you no harm, just wanted to see
Sing me your song, solve my mystery
I won't do you no harm, just wanted to see
That you're a person just like me

[Verse 2]
They are they background of your everyday situation
Look all around you start to wonder really who these people are
They might be watching, wondering quite the same of you
So break this auto pilot path and try to start something new

[Chorus]You might also like
