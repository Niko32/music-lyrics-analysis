Our hearts would give us away
The die had been cast and faces gone past
Who pray that chance comes again
And we raged in the streets to the sound of defeat
As our debts grew larger each day
But in place of regret were the good times we spent
In beds where once we lay

And I had to ask I just had to ask
Where it all slips away
And I had to ask I just had to ask
Where it all slips away
And you held onto me saying tenderly
You'll go on, just go on
And you held onto me saying tenderly
You'll go on, just go on, and on, and on

It was a time to remember
We ran from forever
A time to remember
We'll never forget it
We were young
We were singing
Our lives were beginning
We covered up the cracks for a while
You might also likeAs we fell for the breeze of the underground sleaze
We ran and danced together
And the boys in the bar might not get all that far
But they never had it better

And I had to ask …

It was a time to remember…

And maybe one day
We'll think about what got away
And maybe one day
We'll think of faces and the names
It's all the same
We drink alone in penniless lane
Through the tears and the lies and the lost cold lonely nights

A time to remember…. X 2

When we sang for the good life
