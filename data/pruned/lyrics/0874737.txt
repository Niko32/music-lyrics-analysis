No burning towers, just hours of peace
Between us at least
No pretense no violence makes no sense

It isn't my heart that's grown cold
The same mistakes are getting old
I'm lost for words I don't know what to do

But when I'm lying here with you
And the whole world's out of tune
You're the one and only voice that makes things right
So stay with me tonight

Behind our door there's no hunger
No one trying to sell me heaven
Just loving arms it's just tonight
I don't want to hear 'bout our trying times
Don't wanna know about lost children
About someone held for ransom

It isn't my heart that's grown cold
The same mistakes are getting old
I'm lost for words I don't know what to do

But when I'm lying here with you
And the whole world's out of tune
You're the one and only voice that makes thing right
So stay with me tonightYou might also like
