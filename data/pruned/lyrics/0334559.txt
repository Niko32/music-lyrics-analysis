He works hard to give her all he thinks she wants
But it tears her apart 'cause nothing's for her heart
He pulls in late to wake her up with a kiss goodnight
If he could only read her mind, she'd say

[Chorus]
Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open a door for me, what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

[Verse 2]
Now the days have grown to years of feeling all alone
As she sits and wonders, if all she's doing is wrong
'Cause lately she'd try anything just to turn his head
Would it make a difference if she said, if she said?

[Chorus]
Buy me a rose, call me from work
Open the door for me, what would it hurt?
Show me you love me by the look in your eyes
These are the little things I need the most in my life

[Bridge]
And the more that he lives, the less that he tries
To show her the love that beats from inside
And the more she gives, the more that he sees
This is the story of you and me
You might also like[Chorus]
So, I bought you a rose on the way home from work
To open a door to a heart that I hurt
And I hope you notice this look in my eyes (My eyes)
'Cause I'm gonna make things right for the rest of your life

[Outro]
Rest of your life (Oh-ooh)
I'm gonna hold you tonight, tonight
And do all the dull things for the rest of your life
Of your life, ooh, oh-ooh
