All around the world
Let's go all around the world
All around the world
Take me all around the world
Give me joy, give me love
Take it all around the world

[Verse 1]
So much love, love is real
So much life, life is what you feel
It's in your mind, it's in your heart and soul
Your time is right, you've just got to know
It's time to let go

[Chorus]
All around the world
Let's go all around the world
All around the world
Take me all around the world
I said all around the world
Let's go all around the world
Give me joy, give me love
Take it all around the world

[Verse 2]
Make a wish, dreams come true
Follow your heart, it is all there for you
It's crazy, it's a crazy world
Come to the music, come lose your mind
Follow the rhythm, don't get left behind

[Chorus Outro]
All around the world
Let's go all around the world
All around the world
Take me all around the world
I said all around the world
Let's go all around the world
Give me joy, give me love
Take it all around the world
