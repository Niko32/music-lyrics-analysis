But I pit stopped on grunge rock
I’m Coming up and I won't stop
I'm tropical like rumba
Im so hot, come and get my music like a dope shot
De told to me kill on a track but please homie no cops
A vagabond meets james bond
I mulan for the moola
Super duper ruler, but looking like Oompa Loompa’s
Momma said I’d make it
So I'mma I said I'mma do it
I knew it, I love the music
Kinda wouldn’t wanna blew it
Mean blow it, hold it, I know it the passion I gotta show it
Grab the microphone and the room just started get colder
I know I’m Living my dreams like Dicaprio
Rapping I'm Happy yo, forever trying to get at the pot o' gold
Parado, Derrotado, Cagado, Valado, Mimado
Falam Falam tanto que meu ouvido ta inchado
Quando eu disse que rimava, todo mundo riu
So que foda-se eu rimo, vivo, represento o BrazilYou might also like
