I cut my hair
I watched it fall
On these nights you desire
To go and change who you are
So won't you come
Cuz it's almost gone
I've now someone new
But only for a day or two
It's the sweet
Sweetest lie
So let me think
Someone new
Won't you come see the face I stole
From some book
About grace
So won't you come
Cuz it's almost gone
I've now someone new
But only for a day or two
So won't you come
Cuz it's almost gone
I've now someone new
But only for a day or twoYou might also like
