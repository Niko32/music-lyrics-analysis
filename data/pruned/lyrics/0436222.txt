Things will never be the same again
I close my eyes and remember
A place in the sun where we used to live

Now death is at my door
He's sneaking around out there
Hoping that I step on out
He longs for me, and someday we
Will go downtown in his car

Ask someone who knew me
They will never be the same again
They tell their lies, and something dies
Inside us all, it makes me cry

Even though I know
That the ship will still sail on
Long after I'm gone
Gone, I'll be gone

In this world of wisdom
No one ever really has a clue
They kill their lives every day
With what they say and what they do
You might also likeBut heaven knows I know
That the ship will still sail on
Long after I'm gone
Gone, I'll be gone
