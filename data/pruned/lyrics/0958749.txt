The less we seem to understand
The how, when and why of it all
The more we seem to grow, we grow
The less we seem to manifest, manifest the best of the Sun
We should just all let it shine
Shine into our hearts
Let it shine into our minds
When we put our love together
I know we can get this right
We have strayed so far from greatness
And I can’t just stand by and fake this
Oh people of the sun, people of the sun
People of the sun, people of the sun
People of the sun
The more we seem to know, we know
The less we seem to understand
The how, when and why of it all
The more we seem to grow
The less we seem to manifest, manifest the best of the Sun
We should just all let it show us
Show us all the way
Let Him guide us everyday
And whenever we are feeling lost
Look up and be saved
This is the last call for action y’all
Stand up, be proud and tall
Coming straight from queens and kings
When you walk I can do all things
We can’t let this system keep us down
We gotta keep livin’ for the Sun
And learn to wear our crowns
So bask in all your glory
Oh people of the sun, people of the sun
People of the sun, people of the sun
People of the sun, people of the sun
People of the sun..You might also like
