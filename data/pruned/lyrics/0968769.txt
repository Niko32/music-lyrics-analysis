Irene, goodnight
Irene, goodnight
Goodnight, Irene
Goodnight, Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

[Verse 1]
Last Saturday night I got married
Me and my wife settled down
Now, me and my wife are parted
I'm gonna take another stroll downtown

[Chorus]
Irene, goodnight
Irene, goodnight
Goodnight, Irene
Goodnight, Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I take a great notion
To jump into the river and drown
You might also like[Chorus]
Irene, goodnight
Irene, goodnight
Goodnight, Irene
Goodnight, Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

[Chorus]
Stop ramblin', stop your gamblin'
Stop staying out late at night
Go home to your wife and family
Stay there by your fireside, bright

[Chorus]
Irene, goodnight
Irene, goodnight
Goodnight, Irene
Goodnight, Irene
I'll see you in my dreams
