Bowls in the night, blunts in the day
Dope in my sock, high's what I gotta stay
12:45 AM on the street
Sitting on the curb, smokin'
Strike the match and then I light the pipe
Light the night, young nightlight
I look good in that nightlight
My skin glisten, my chain shine
Feeling like the fucking world's mine
Scarface in his fucking prime
Got a pet tiger that live outside
So if you thinking about jackin', you better fucking think twice
Have that 9, you better take my life
Cold shoulder in the hot nights
I'll tuck you in and send you off right
Then I'll let the switchblade give you a kiss goodnight, bitch

[Hook]
I'm getting high as fuck, and yelling at the clock
Please slow down, cuz I don't wanna die yet
Bowls in the night,  blunts in the day
Dope in my sock, high's what I gotta stay
12:45 AM on the street
Sitting on the curb, smoking weed
