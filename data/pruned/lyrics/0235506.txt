You tell me where I’ve gotta be
I speed into the darkness
But I swear that I can’t see a thing in front of me
You know it’s true
I’m not driving anymore
I can’t keep up with you
You’re closing in behind me
I’ve got headlights in my eyes
Don’t you get too close to me
Can’t you see that we’ll collide and end up casualties
There’s just no room
I’m not driving anymore
I can’t keep up with you
So leave me on my own
Run me down and race away from me
I’ve got nowhere to go to
I don’t think I can get back on my feet – back on my feet
You came right out of nowhere
Eyes wide and terrified
And I can’t put my brakes on
I can’t swerve to save your life ‘cause then I’ll lose control
And I can’t choose
I’m not driving anymore
I can’t keep up with you
So leave me on my own
Run me down and race away from me
I’ve got nowhere to go to
I don’t think I can get back on my feet, back on my feet
Get me out of harm’s way
Can’t you see I’m paralyzed
You might also likeI wanna fade out gracefully
But you keep keeping me alive to face another day

Can’t you see I’m through
I’m not driving anymore – I can’t keep up with you
Tell me how long have I got (I want to end this earthly toil) – till this mad life expires
I wanna go swimming in the soil and not come up for breath – sit in God’s room
I’m not driving anymore – I can’t keep up with you

I’m unfit for consumption

I don’t know how to play my part
I swear I’m all alone in this thing
A blind man driving my car into oblivion

Let it come soon

I’m not driving anymore
I can’t keep up with you
