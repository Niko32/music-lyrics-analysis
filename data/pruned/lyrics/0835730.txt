Two old timer-mammoths they were stealing the show
Crashing to eachother with all their might
It was an earthquake
Crash into each other with all their might

It feels just like the first time like the first time when you're making love
The stars and the planets are falling from above
This feeling that makes you wanna explode
That's your earthquake
That burning feeling makes you want to explode

If you hear our rocking music and you feel that rocking beat
There ain't nothing you can do than just move your arms and feet
This musics' more explosive than TNT
It's an earthquake
It's more explosive than TNT

So now you know what to do what to do when you wanna quake
Rock and love so hard that your body wants to shake
Let yourself go and have a real good time
Have an earthquake
When you wanna quake let your body shakeYou might also like
