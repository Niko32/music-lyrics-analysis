Back in third grade, I used to wanna spit bars
Now days I'm getting laid, while I'm sparking up a gar
Girl told me I'm addicted, always feel conflicted
I just wanna smoke with my niggas dawg, kick it
But I want my chick too, every time I win, I loose
It's a Catch 22, that's why I like my beats smooth
I be with Tom, dropping bombs, over some soul shit
Ring the alarm, I'm 'bouta harm 'em with emotion, uh
You ain't never seen Nikes like these
I put 'em in your face, I just do it, 3-D
And when I'm in the party, I'm hardly, ever not ballin'
I used to be wack, then why the fuck you keep callin'?
Me, I'm from the KY
Constantly we stay high
Put our lyrics in a robot, Goon A-I
This is what it's like when a pot head ponders
Give your boy a beat and I'ma let my thoughts wonder

[Verse 2: B.A.K.E.R]
Yo, my bitch hate it, when I be getting faded
I be like you baby, what is you really saying?
Cause I remember back, you was all about that life
My right hand, the only girl who had that mix down right
She would pour up with a nigga, now she pouring out her feelings
I'm like, can we pour some more so we can ignore all of these feelings
Cause faded love is the best love
With no chaser, we don't need that tainted love
Yea I hated love, that was like a year ago
I used to miss you too but that was like a beer ago
Now I'm on some new shit
I gotta new chick who all about this fadedadated shit with me
You could've been here sipping shit with me
But now you tripping lately
What's good with you baby, heard you got a lame nigga
He be drinking water, oh them Bobby Boucher lame niggas
You got a water boy, fuck that shit, pour up mother fucker

I'm tryna' get my baby back, baby back
I'll let her rock my Lakers cap
And she ain't gotta give it back
In the whip or in the sac
I'ma give that ass a smack
Loud pack, freak a black
Gimmie this, gimmie that, baby fill in what I lack
Like some cement in the cracks, skeet semen on your ass
Fuck rap, fuck cash, give the kid a blunt wrap and a bus pass
And I'll haul ass, to find wherever your at
You welcome me on top of you, similar to a door mat
I can't handle shit alone, when I get grown
I be on my bullshit, cigarettes, mobile phones
Pocket buzz, pocket buzz, I knew exactly who it was
I been here and you been there, the shit is too fucked up
So I get fucked up, smoked out, more blunts
Real shit, ill shit, but I need her every month
If she ever leave me I'ma die, where the grave at
I love you and I need you but I'm tryna' go and blaze that...
