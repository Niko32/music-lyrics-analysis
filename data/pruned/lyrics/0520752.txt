Running away from my problems is a race I’ll never win
I mean, you gotta understand, be honest with me, till the end
Sometimes, we just have to deal with the fact that life doesn’t
Always go our way, I just have to remain (positive) x3
Smile big, laugh often, never take this life for granted (for granted) (x2)
When life changes to be, harder, change yourself to be, stronger
Be smarter and thank the Lord

(C)
It’s that
State of mind x4
Yes lord x2 (thank you Jesus)
It’s that
State of mind x4
Yes lord x2 (thank you Jesus)

Be honest with the people that love you, they deserve your honesty
Don’t let one little thing ruin your day, it’s not worth it, life is short, be happy (2x)
What comes easy won’t last, whatever happens don’t stress (x2)
God has many different chapters for us, one bad one doesn’t mean it’s the last (it’s the last)
No matter how good or bad, your life is, wake up each morning and be thankful to god, that, you have one
Be thankful, that you have one

(C)
It’s that
State of mind x4
Yes lord x2 (thank you Jesus)
It’s that
State of mind x4
Yes lord x2 (thank you Jesus)

Be strong, when you’re weak, be brave, when you’re scared (and)
Be humble, when you’re winning (Be humble when you’re winning)
Good times, become memories, bad times, become lessons
Have faith that things will work out, maybe not how you planned it
But, count your blessings, instead of your tears, count your strengths, instead of your fears
Instead of looking at your pass years, allow yourself to recognize your mistakes, it’ll make you a better person
Don’t judge, if you don’t understand the reasons
