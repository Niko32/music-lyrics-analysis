I'll be there
When there's nothing left
Night and day
Holding you
Harmony
Deep inside your soul
Meet me there

[Pre-Chorus: Cristina, Andrea]
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me
Deep inside?

[Chorus: Cristina]
There's no time
To deny that I'll need you
And I'll be there
To inhale your delightful day
There's no time
To deny I will need you
That's why I'll be there
To relieve your painful day

[Verse: Andrea and Cristina]
Hiding well
Where the pain is real
Night and day
Grow'n' in you
Anger is
Poison in your veins
Meet me there
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Cristina, Andrea]
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me?
Can you feel me
Deep inside?

[Chorus: Cristina]
There's no time
To deny that I'll need you
And I'll be there
To inhale your delightful day
There's no time
To deny I will need you
That's why I'll be there
To relieve your painful day

[Instrumental]

[Outro/Chorus: Cristina and Andrea]
Deep inside
There's no time
To deny that I'll need you
And I'll be there
To inhale your delightful day
There's no time
To deny I will need you
That's why I'll be there
To relieve your painful day (day...)
