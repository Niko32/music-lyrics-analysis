When my heart aches I’m drowning
Pain won’t go away
And in my cups brown fills my brain
Won’t go away
These five yellow girls all on parade
Asphyxiate
Still stuck in a cage tryna ply my trade
Won’t go away

[Chorus]
And I’m afraid
Your love will blow me away
Am I dumb?
All cause I numb the pain
Or am I just another runaway

[Verse 2]
When shadows creep across my floor
Won’t go away
You’ve had enough but still want more
Won’t go away
My engine gunning thunderbirds
Asphalt wanna race?
Still trapped in a box tryna clear my name
Won’t go away
You might also like[Chorus]
And I’m afraid
Your love will blow me away
Am I dumb?
All cause I numb the pain
Or am I just another runaway?
Runaway

[Bridge]
Runaway
(Yeah yeah)
(Yeah yeah)
Runaway
(Yeah, yeah) Yeah (Yeah yeah) Yeah

[Verse 3]
This Afghan kush we’re bubbling
Won’t burn away
My moon my queen been gone since may
So I lie awake
My easy death in ecstasy
My hands still shake
When my heart aches I’m drowning pain
Won’t go away

[Chorus]
And I’m afraid
Tour love will blow me away
Am I dumb?
All cause I numb the pain
And I’m afraid
Your love will blow me away
Am I done?
All cause I numb the pain
Or am I just another runaway
Runaway
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah
