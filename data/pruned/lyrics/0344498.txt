Drove to the church in my suit and tie
But I just couldn't bring myself to go inside
So I sat alone in my truck across the street
Watched that chauffeur smoking cigarettes by that long white limousine

[Pre-Chorus]
And I could just imagine what was goin' on in there
Sunlight streamin' through the stained glass and those flowers in your hair

[Chorus]
And in less time than it takes a tear to fall
Those bells rang loud as thunder
As they opened up the doors
Now I don't have to wonder anymore

[Verse 2]
Laughin' and a cryin', tossin' that bouquet
And when you got in that limo I drove off the other way
And I still don't know why things happened like they did
But I parked that old pickup on that lonesome river bridge

[Pre-Chorus]
I took your ring from my pocket and I held it one last time
Watched that diamond sparkle, I drew back and I let her fly
You might also like[Chorus]
And in less time than it takes to tear to fall
Oh, that old ring went under
Lord, and now it's gone for sure
No and I don't have to wonder anymore

[Outro]
Well, the angels sang like thunder
As I felt myself go under
Now I don't have to wonder anymore
