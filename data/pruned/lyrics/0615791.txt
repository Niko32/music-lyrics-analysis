Running scared
Wondering what I'm doing so far from home
Beginning not to care that I was so alone
Then my eyes met hers and without one word
I could tell what was gonna happen
I could feel it in my bones

[Chorus]
By the dark of the moon
There's a fire in the night
She took me to her room
Ah, ya know it felt so right
The heat's growing higher
The flame of desire
By the dark of the moon
Ahh, there's a fire in the night

[Verse 2]
When she told me
She didn't often do this kind of thing
She said please hold me
Hold me tight so I don't have to think
Oh, her gentle touch
Really moved me so much
The flames of love swept over us
Like a burning light
You might also like[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
There's a fire in the night baby
There's a fire in the night ohhh
Oh yeah, there's a fire in the night
Oh I'm on fire ohhh
By the dark of the moon
There's a fire in the night
Oh yeah
