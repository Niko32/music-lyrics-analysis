Roll on buddy roll on
Roll on buddy roll on
You wouldn't roll so slow if you knew what I know
Roll on buddy roll on

[Verse]
I got a home in Tennessee[x2]
I got a home in sunny Tennessee
Roll on buddy roll on
Tenthee wants a nine dollar shawl[x2]
I come over the hill with a twenty dollar bill
And ask baby where you been so long
Baby where you been so long[x2]
Well I been in the pen with the rough and rowdy men
And asked baby where you been so long
And I never liked no rail-road man[x2]
Cause rail-road man will kill you if he can
Drink down your blood like wine
Baby where'd you stay last night[x2]
Well I slept in the pen with the rough and rowdy men
Baby where'd you stay last night
