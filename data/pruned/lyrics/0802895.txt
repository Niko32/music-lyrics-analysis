I'm not in love, so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get it wrong, don't think you've got it made
I'm not in love, no, it's because

[Verse 2]
Said, I'd like to see you, but then again
It doesn't mean you mean that much to me
So if I call you, don't make a fuss
Don't tell your friends about the two of us
I'm not in love, no, it's because

[Verse 3]
I keep your picture up on the wall
It hides a nasty stain still lying there
It hides a nasty stain still lying there
I keep your picture up on the wall
It hides a nasty stain still lying there
It hides a nasty stain still lying there
So don't you ask me to give it back
I know you know it doesn't mean that much to me
I'm not in love, it's because

[Bridge]
Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh, you'll wait a long time
Ooh, you'll wait a long time for me
Ooh, you'll wait a long time

I'm not in love so don't forget it
It's just a silly phase I'm going through
And just because I call you up
Don't get me wrong, don't think you've got it made

[Outro]
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
