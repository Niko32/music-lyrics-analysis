Let there be Earth and there was Earth
If I had my way I would ask of him
Please let there be you

Let there be rain and there was rain
Let there be heaven up above
If I had my way I would ask of him
Please let there be you

You are the feeling of Spring
You're the beginning of dawn
You are the meaning of everything
How could anyone go wrong

Let there be stars and there were stars
Let there be moon and there was moon
If I had my way I would ask of him
Please let there be you
Please let there be youYou might also like
