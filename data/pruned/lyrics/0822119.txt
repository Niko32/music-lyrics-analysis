And drunken alibies to you
I can't believe
I danced with naked with the turkey
I got stuffing everywhere
I didn't mean to throw up in the children's hair
And I'm sorry I shot your dog
But at the time my mind was in a fog

I went and poured the punch
Then I had a cup of rosy wine
Guess I had a drop to much
'Cause when I woke up I was dizzy and blind
Wish I hadn't burned your house to the ground
But the Christmas season always gets me down
So darlin' if you're free in the new year
Maybe we could go out for a beer
