Oh I know, I'm only dreaming
Cos I'll awake, and you'll be gone
And my tears will still be streaming
As my broken, heart beats on

[Verse 2]
Yes I know, I'm only dreaming
But I'll just, keep dreaming on
I will dream about the pleasures
That we shared in days gone by

[Verse 3]
And I'll remember and I'll treasure
Every kiss and your kind eyes
And I will dream that you still hold me
In your arms as you did then

[Verse 4]
And I recall each thing you told me
Hear your voice as I did then
Yes I know, I'm only dreaming
But I'll dream, and I will too

[Verse 5]
I'll be here, and I'll be waiting
And I will dream, of your return
Some will say I'm being foolish
While some will say that I'm just blind
You might also like[Verse 6]
And that I want to face what the truth is
That you are, no longer mine
But I will dream, your brave retaliation
To some sweet day, to their surprise
You will say your love's still burning
You'll dry each tear drop from my eyes

[Verse 7]
But I know, I'm only dreaming
Cause I'll awake and be alone
And my tears will still be streaming
And you will still be just as gone

[Outro]
Yes I know I'm only dreaming
But I must keep dreaming, on
