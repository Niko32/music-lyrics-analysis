And I don't mean a touch now and then
It's been a long time since you felt like my woman
And even longer since I felt like your man

So tell me if you think it's over
And I'll leave it up to you how it ends
And if there's someone who wants to love you can give him
Well there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in

We've been livin' a life for so long now
How much more do you think we can stand
There's an old friend out there and she's waiting
Lord she's happy just holding my hand

So tell me if you think it's over
And I'll leave it up to you how it ends
And if he still wants the love you can give him
Well there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back in
Yeah there's a honky tonk angel who'll take me back inYou might also like
