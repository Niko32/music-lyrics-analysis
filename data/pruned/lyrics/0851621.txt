Will you walk with, walk with me?
Where is forgiveness?
The lash is tired, and it seems to see
Give me deliverance
From your history topped with lies
Where is your witness?
There is none, hide your wings and we’ll take the sky

You will never feel so alive
As you will on the day that you see
The sacred ways that are playing
To bring a new faith

Smile tonight in the sacred light
And you are looking like a new god
Smile tonight, for you have arrived
Arrived to bring the heavens down

Who is the savior?
You can walk this golden sea
For just this moment
Close your eyes and die with me
Who needs forgiveness
When we all speak fluent lies?
Here is deliverance
You’re in it, lose yourself, and we’ll take the sky

This is your final confession
I’ve never felt like this before

I hold your final submission, oh
You never looked so good before

Oh, smile tonight in the sacred light
And you are looking like a new god
Smile tonight, for you have arrived
Have arrived, yeah
Smile tonight in the sacred light
And you are looking like a new god
Smile tonight, for you have arrived
Arrived to bring the heavens
Arrived to bring the heavens
Down
