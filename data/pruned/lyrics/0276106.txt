The thoughts in my head are demeaning
The thoughts I had bred are defeated
The thoughts of a failure, I thought that I had failed here
With a fair share of weak tracks mixed with emotions of my failures
What the fuck you mean?
Talking bout bravado
What the fuck you mean?
Rocking at the bottom
Rocking it, I rocked the shit
Ate it up and followed
At least I gave it life
I would have hate it to be hollow
I tell myself in hope that my aim ain't out of reach
I tell myself in hope that what I'm aiming for, I'm making for
I'm playing roles I'm made and rated for
Fuck you degrading for?
If we were face to face
Maybe I would rate it more
The hate is old fashioned I hate it
But I ain't shit, so niggas say they hate this
So face it, when its said and done
The confidence is gone when the circumstances changes

[Hook 1]
I dropped my first tape and I ain't get the play I wanted
The ones I desired I would have retired
Even before my career had started
I was like "damn man I'm done"
I was like "yea man you won", I'm tired
And I ain't got no feelings to lose
Turns out that my ego was bruised
But its alright
You might also like[Verse 2]
It wasn't really
But was it really
Something to hang on to when the pressure is above the ceiling
Hanging over heads raining down is the commentary
Giving play by plays of the days spent restoring feelings
Thinking bout all the kids you better than
Kids 18 rap like veterans
And that would put all this shit in doubt
Make me run away, boy I'm lost, I'm in Neverland
Its the cycle that never ends
I'd never end on a whim that I'd never win
I never win, in fact I'll just let it end
The little men bring terror, I just let em in
Hoping that my fear is what will drive me
To strive for more than what I'm better than
I realized all the fear inside me
Makes me humble and a better man


[Hook 2]
All the doubt in my life
Helps keep me inspired
I'm not a liar
I promise I will be someone before my time expires
I be like "yo man I won"
I still know where I'm from, inquire
Still don't got no feelings to lose
Turns out that my ego was bruised
But its alright
