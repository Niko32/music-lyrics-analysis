Ever since the time you told me we were through
Seven lonely days I've cried and cried for you

Oh my darling I'm crying hoo hoo hoo hoo
There's no use in denying I've cried for you
What's your favorite past time just a making me blue
Last week was the last time I cried for you

Seven hankies blue I filled with my tears seven letters too I filled with my fears
Guess it never paced to make your lover blue
Cause seven lonely days I've cried and cried for you
Oh my darling I'm crying hoo hoo hoo hoo...
Seven lonely days make one lonely week...
