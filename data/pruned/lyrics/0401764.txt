Poor little girl
With her head in the air
There's a poorly sick world all around you

[Chorus 2]
Poor horny boy
One thing on his mind
That poor little girl
He must find you

[Chorus 3]
There's a whole lot of love
Shaking inside of me
And I must figure out why it's there

[Chorus 4]
There's a bottomless heart
That's hooked into all of you
And it's wondering how much you care

[Chorus 1]

[Chorus 2]

[Chorus 3]
You might also like[Chorus 4]

[Verse 1]
Poor little boy
Head in a whirl
There's a phony slick world all around you
That poor little girl
With her head in the air
That poor little boy he must find you

[Chorus 3]

[Chorus 4]

[Verse 2]
There's a need and desire I have
To express what's inside of me
I must figure it out while it's still there
And an endless amout of
Of a joy that you touch me with
Thought it's almost too much for me to bear

[Outro]
Poor little girl
