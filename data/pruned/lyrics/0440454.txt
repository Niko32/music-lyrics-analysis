Always we bleeded
As emotions lost in your mind
All that i believed
Was the one thing i couldn't find
And i was there at the turn
Waiting to let you go

[hook: soul frenzy]
Were fighting till  top
To freak the fuck out
Were fighting till top
To hurt you now
We can't say
Fuck you all around

[Verse 2: soul frenzy]
The horrors missed it
As the blames finded we were to loud
I wanted to hit this
But shouldn't stop from breaking it down
And i was there at the sun
Caught in the hurting song
And i was there at the sun
Waiting to let you know
You might also like[hook: soul frenzy]

[Verse 3: pimp knuckles]
You told me cash is the lie
And i believed when you die
Played suicide man you the suicide girl one thing
One musical but you can't sing
You lost that right to finish the song
Mentioned me in your date named john
So when you fall i didn't cry
I said this before this was your last ride

[bridge: soul frenzy]
And i was there at the sun
Waiting to let you know

[hook: soul frenzy & pimp knuckles]

[bridge 2: pimp knuckles & soul frenzy]
(so when you fall i didn't cry
I said this before this was your last ride)
We can't say
Fuck you all around
