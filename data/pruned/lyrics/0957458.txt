Looking down over the city wondering if you still fitted in
Then you hear a song you remember drifting up from the street
Waiting for the moment of recognition to kick in
This is just a test
Turn on the lights for long enough
Check you're in the right spot
This is just a memory test
Turn off your mind for long enough
Hits you in the right spot
Down the stairs eyes are half open into the car radio on
Drive thru the pink dot there's not enough alcohol in your blood
To get you back home
Fall thru the door turntable spinning D'Angelo and the Devil's Pie
The bass and the city and the touch of a new guy
Maybe this is where you belong
This is just a test
Turn on the lights for long enough
Check you're in the right spot
This is just a memory test
You've lived in your body long enough
You know that it's what you want when it hits you in the right spot
Do what you do it best
Turn off your mind for long enoughYou might also like
