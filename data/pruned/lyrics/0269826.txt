All we are is entertainment caught up in our own derangement
Tell us what to say and what to do
All we are are pretty faces, picture perfect bottled rage
Packaged, synthesized versions of you

[Chorus]
We've all made petty fortunes but we can't afford a life
Confined to pull out quotes in hotel rooms
They all scream California and it's toppling empire
But can't you see the end is coming soon?

[Verse 2]
Come one, come all, the new sensation guarantees then obligations
Spotlights follow every single move
Basking here on ten foot stages, pouty lips and oh so jaded
All as if we have something to prove

[Chorus 2]
Despite these petty fortunes we still can't afford a life
Confined to pull out quotes in hotel rooms
They all scream California and it's toppling empire
But can't you see the end is here?

[Bridge]
And if we cared at all about this unknown plight
Then we'd do something more to finally make this right
You might also like[Verse 3]
Is this only entertainment? Pull the curtains, places please
We've learned to sing and dance and cry on cue
But this is more than entertainment in a world so sick with pain
This is the only thing that's real or true

[Chorus 3]
We've all made petty fortunes but we can't afford a life
Confined to pull out quotes in hotel rooms
They all scream bloody murder over graves already dug
But can't you see the end!?
