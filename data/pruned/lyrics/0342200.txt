To where I used to be, yeah
Knowing who I am
Makes it seem too far out of reach

If I knew what I know now
I'd probably would have left it all alone, oh yeah
So now it seems to me, hmm
I can't find my way back home

Nothing in the world
Could ever give me a reason
And nothing in this world
Could ever tell me why

I wanna know the answers
But they don't come easy
Help me, tell me
Where is my heart?

Hmm, what I wanna know is
Is somebody give me
Give me a reason
Oh, I need to know

Tell me why, I gotta know
I wanna know the answer
Ooh, tell me why
Why am I living trife? Why I live trife
