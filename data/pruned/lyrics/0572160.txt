A minor inconvenience but I'm glad you still came
The way we drop bombs are like shit Moms with Hussein
Oh shit I'm, juggling hand grenades
Yes I did jam the brakes like crack, on a sandwich plate
Don't understand? Well let me dumb it down
This shit is tighter than, virgin clowns in Buggies now
So I am not stoppin'
Batman, I'm not Robbin'
Colder than, a half assed prep to a Hot Pocket
Yo Exec! Pop trunks, let the cannons off
You would've thought we projected artilleries at elephants
Ginger-ale, Cheez-Itz and a Djarum black
Throw bone marrow at DJ's I'm bringing it back
Go ahead, take a stab, I'm Julius Caesar to rap
I'm Friday the 13th cracks to breaking your Mother's back
Gold tied around my right hand phalange and
Your plans against me I suggest you disband, nigga

[Verse 2: Exec The Bright]
Guns and roses, passionate bullets I let off into the garden, a Mac to your Adam's apple
Savagely speaking your bleeding neck on a noose, motherfucker you like a ho's vagina, a pussy on the loose
I'm feeling experimental, I prefer brain from them bitches who are experimental
I'm like a fuckin' whole nigga with gentleman credentials
Bad bitch, no draws, I don't believe in stencils, I don't believe in stencils!
I don't really give a fuck about you phony lames
Get you squares up out my circle like a Sony game
I'm way too equipped, I'm my own militia
I only fuck with fire, you got reggie in your Swisher
Speakin' all that bullshit, fuck your ass-talk
Got your bitch on my rock, that's your ass fault
I've never regretted shit I've done to no apology
Cuz all you rappers are actors like Oscar nominees, niggaYou might also like
