Take it as it comes – won’t slow down
We’re chasing down the sun – it’s you and me
The night has just begun – so don’t fall asleep
If morning never comes – hold me now

I’ve wasted many days and many nights
I drank the pain away – but maybe that’s just
How its suppose to be – you here with me
The world can end today – hold me now

Hold me – just hold me
We don’t need - the morning
Show me – tonight we
Are finally – living
The lighting – is breaking
Your body – is shaking
Hold me – just hold me

Hold me nowYou might also like
