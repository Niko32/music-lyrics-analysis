It's what you see in men
Does my rugged face cut scars like daggers?
Faces on the wall
We can't touch you but you move our hobby
Reach into the hall
Step around the feast and find the lobby
Open up the door
See an angel and you lose your body

[Refrain]
And my body
Is her angel
Her angel
Her angel

[Verse 1]
Picking out a name, stretching out on your sheets
Isabelle, Isabelle, can't you hear me? I can't tell
Is the devil in the room? is he hiding in the first drawer?
Hold me dear, hold me dear, can't you feel me touch your ear?

["Hallucination" Verse 2]
Meat was on the bone
But the children huddled and devoured
Keep them in the home
Let their minds go where their bikes can't take them
Flinching finds me first
So I'll hide 'til she is in the basement
When I light the match
Touching angels shadows on the ceiling
You might also like[Refrain]
And my body
Is her angel
Her angel
Her angel

[Verse 2]
Racing 'round the room, your forehead is on fire
Isabelle, Isabelle, they're all talking, you're not well
Looking like a ghost, doctors shaking their heads
Say my name, say my name, can't you see me? I'm to blame
I'm to blame

[Bridge]
(There have been sadder days)
Sadder days
(Ah, the angel!)
Woah, look what I found
Sadder days
(My god, the angel!
The angel!
Pretty angels...)
Starting to rotting and nodding, pretty angel
Starting to rotting and nodding, pretty angel
Starting to rotting and nodding, pretty angel
Starting to rotting and nodding, pretty angel
Starting to rotting and nodding, pretty angel
Starting to rotting and nodding, pretty angel
Pretty angel
["Hallucination" Verse 3]
Grab the preachers throat
Can't you see the light within the shutters?
Who set up the ball
Don't you see your dancing frees my chances
Put me on my feet
There's an angel with a hand thats open
Write my name in ink
Send a letter to the ground and beg him

[Refrain]
And my body
Is the angel
The angel
The angel

[Verse 3]
Folding all your clothes, changing all your bed sheets
Isabelle, Isabelle, you're not with me where I dwell
Drinking from your glass, smash it on the pyre
It's a shame, it's a shame, can't you see me? I'm to blame
I'm to blame

[Outro]
Some people's lives awake to itsy-bitsy "I'm so sorrys"
The branch breaks, you crack a window and the wind might say
"The birds are calling for you, please don't follow
The birds are calling for you, please don't follow
The birds are calling for you, please don't follow
The birds are calling for you, please don't follow
The birds are calling for you, please don't follow
The birds are calling for you, please don't follow
The birds are calling for you, please don't follow
The birds are calling for you, please don't follow
The birds are calling for you, please don't follow
The birds are calling for you, please don't follow
The birds are calling for you, please don't follow
The birds are calling for you, please don't follow
The birds are calling for you, please don't follow
The birds are calling for you, please don't follow"
