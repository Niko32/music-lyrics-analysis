Midnight blues, summer hues
Late at night I think 'bout you
Gloomy skies, sweet goodbyes
Late at night I think 'bout you
And I wonder do you think about me too?
And I wonder do you feel the things I do?

[Pre-Chorus]
Or is it just me now?
Or is it just me now?
'Cause I can't see clear now
No, I can't see clear now
And I need you here now
I don't need to know how
You fill the emptiness I feel inside

[Chorus]
Oh, you make me feel like I can
I can fly again
You make me feel like I can
Can be loved again

[Verse]
Midnight blues, sunset views
Late at night I sing to you
You might also like[Chorus]
You make me feel like I can
I can fly again
(Welcome to the next level, makin' beats in my cave)
(Welcome to the next level, makin' beats in my cave)
You make me feel like I can
Can be loved again
(Welcome to the next level, makin' beats in my cave)
Can be loved again
(Welcome to the next level, makin' beats in my cave)
Can be loved again
