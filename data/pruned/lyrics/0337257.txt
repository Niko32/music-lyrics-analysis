It's all around you now, but you don't know it
It's tugging at your heart but you don't show it
It's just a matter of time
It's going to hit you right between the eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You wake up in the middle of the night
I'll be the only thing on your mind
Won't be able to shake it loose
When love gets a hold of you

[Chorus]
Before you have your first cup of coffee
You're going to pick up the phone and call me
Won't believe what you say and do
When love gets a hold of you

[Verse 2]
Because it's going to be written all over your face
All your friends going to tell you how much you've changed
Feeling things that you can't deny
Going crazy and you don't know why

[Pre-Chorus]
You wake up in the middle of the night
I'll be the only thing on your mind
Won't be able to shake it loose
When love gets a hold of you
You might also like[Chorus]
Before you have your first cup of coffee
You're going to pick up the phone and call me
Won't believe what you say and do
When love gets a hold of you

[Verse 3]
You're driving home at the end of the day
You find yourself coming by my place
Yeah, you always have a good excuse
When love gets a hold of you

Watch you standing inside my door
Won't remember what you came here for
Can't control what you say and do
When love gets a hold of you

[Pre-Chorus]
You wake up in the middle of the night
I'll be the only thing on your mind
Won't be able to shake it loose
When love gets a hold of you
