I know I'm not there to hold you
Look up see the sky that I do
You make me the happiest of men
I am the happiest of men

[Verse 2]
And if God takes me before you
I just want you to know I love you
And you made me the strongest of all men
I'll remain the happiest of men

[Chorus]
The happiest of men
The happiest of men
The happiest of men
The happiest of men

[Verse 3]
You made (the happiest of men)
Me the strongest of all men (the happiest of men)
I'll remain the happiest of men (the happiest of men)
The happiest of men

[Chorus]
The happiest of men
The happiest of men
The happiest of men
The happiest of men

I miss you
Baby close your eyes
Let's meet
In our dreams tonight
