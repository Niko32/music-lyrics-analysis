Bad luck streak in dancing school
Down on my knees in pain
Bad luck streak in dancing school
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change
Pauline, don't make me beg

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Bad luck streak in dancing school
Down on my knees in pain
I've been acting like a fool
Pauline, I swear I'll change
Down on my knees in pain
Down on my knees in pain
Down on my knees in pain
Down on my knees in pain

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Bad luck streak in dancing school
Down on my knees in pain
I've been breaking all the rules
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change
Swear to God I'll change

Down on my knees in pain
Down on my knees in pain
