Oh, oh

[Verse 1: blackbear]
We kept each other close but cautiously
A ring without a stone, a novelty
We left it to be told in photography
Emotions that we showed so modestly

[Chorus: blackbear]
So I'll keep down below who you are, who you are to me
You're still my favorite thing in the world
I'll just keep down below who you are, who you are to me
You're still my favorite thing in the world (Thing in the world)

[Post-Chorus: blackbear]
Woah, woah, woah

[Verse 2: blackbear]
We left it in the cold and watched it freeze
A seasick undertone comes over me
We left our love to soak in quandary
So tell me, how do I love you, girl?
One day you do, one day you don't, so thoughtlessly, oh

[Chorus: blackbear]
So I'll keep down below who you are, who you are to me (Oh)
You're still my favorite thing in the world (Oh)
I'll just keep down below who you are, who you are to me (Who you are to me)
You're still my favorite thing in the world (Thing in the world)

Late nights be the mission, got me reminiscin'
All the times we kissin', wait
Love got me still trippin', baby girl, I'm slippin'
I ain't got no time to stay
But I can feel the distance, baby girl, listen
We ain't got no time to play
I can see our love dyin', girl, I ain't lyin'
Listen to what I say
But I'm tryna work it out, girl, hope I work it out, girl
But you ain't tryin' to stay
Shit, we got more to do
But this party right here seems more to you
You get fucked up on these late nights
Still at the club 'til it close at two, uh
Two shots wit' your girlfriends
Your heart broken, so you prayin' that the world end, damn
And now you really can't trust men
You take advice when you out with your girlfriends, Prie

[Chorus: blackbear]
Keep down below who you are, who you are to me
You're still my favorite thing in the world
I'll just keep down below who you are, who you are to me
You're still my favorite thing in the world (Thing in the world)
