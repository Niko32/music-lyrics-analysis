To think of all your love she's been denying
And I can't blame you for feeling cheated
Being so in love and so unneeded
But the reason you keep trying is a feeling that I know

I hurt for you
Every time she breaks your heart
Baby I hurt for you
And it's tearing me apart

To care the way I do maybe I'm a fool
I watch you long for her
And I hurt for you

So love won't work out the way you plan it
Only too well I understand it
And I'll be right here to console you
That's the only chance I'll have to hold you
It's so lonely being stranded
With a dream you can't let go

If you could put the one who loves you
Maybe you'll want me now
If you could just see how
I know you long for her
But I hurt for youYou might also like
