I haven't been in this town in weeks
And the only things keeping me alive
And your picture in my pocket, and a dollar fourty five

And I'm walking to your house hoping to hell that you're home

And as I approach your house on the beach
And your front gate is in my reach
Try to think of one single good reason
Why you'd want to take me back in this winter season

You know what, can't think of a one

Yeah, the forecast is for a cold shoulder
It's been two months since I left you in boulder
It was the stupidest thing I've ever done
And now I'm coming back to you unshaved and unslept and sorryYou might also like
