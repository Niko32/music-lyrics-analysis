Hey, Hey Its about that time, spendin' all my dimes, booze is runnin' through my mind
We're not drinking miller light, we're sippin' gin n' sprite
Getting crazy, squeezin' down them little limes, coppin' all that shit, bring it back
Both are mighty fine. We're all floatin' cloud nine, pull them panties to the side
Common girl dont be shy, wave that ass in the sky, now your mans freaking out
Hear his little bitchy wine, its inevitable baby, maybe you'll be fine
Let's drink that cooler wine, now were gettin fucked up, common girl let's go hump
I'll slip it in your hind rump, going down those curvy lumps, stop fucking stallin up
Hear, you ain't findin lust, just hold onto me and scream out thrust
Bumpin' goin' fast, making out, havin' a blast, nevermind, done with that, time to
Make a different rap, goin' to the club, fillin up another cup, hearin' all that
Dub-Step music, isn't loud? But just excuse it. Gettin wasted throwin' up
Its early as fuck, still ain't signs of slowin up, keep your head from blowin up
Showin bitches both my nuts, slappin hoes on the butt, JP, tell them sluts
