I wake up, late at night
Makin' sure you're still by my side
I try hard not to make a sound
Can't help my heart it just beats so loud

So full of love, I could burst
The way I feel about you, girl, I wanna just...

[Chorus]
Scream at the top of my lungs
Tell the whole world how much I love you
Shout it from the highest mountain
Let 'em know I found the girl of my dreams
It's pure electricity
Girl, you get into me like nobody else could
It feels so good I could scream

[Verse 2]
How can I sleep, with you right there
I want to bury my face in your long blonde hair
Moonlight falls, across your skin
I fight the urge buildin' up again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But it's too late, I feel the rush
Runnin' through my body, girl, I wanna just...
You might also like[Chorus]
Scream at the top of my lungs
Tell the whole world how much I love you
Shout it from the highest mountain
Let 'em know I found the girl of my dreams
It's pure electricity
Girl, you get into me like nobody else could
It feels so good I could scream

[Bridge]
Scream at the top of my lungs
Tell the whole world how much I love you

[Chorus]
Scream at the top of my lungs
Tell the whole world how much I love you
Shout it from the highest mountain
Let 'em know I found the girl of my dreams
It's pure electricity
Girl, you get into me like nobody else could
It feels so good I could, can't help myself I gotta, here it comes I'm gonna, scream

[Outro]
You make me wanna scream, baby
Here it comes, I'm gonna, scream
You scream too if you feel you need to
