Hi, it's been a while
Hope I could stop on by
I wonder if you'll hear this when I'm done
It's gonna be a lot more 'til I'm gone
Waste inside my mind
Bloodshot eyes and empty sheets
It's all downhill, 2013
Ostentatious, Austin, Texas
I get so drunk I can barely see
Hit me now before this gets too cute
Don't make me beg in this hotel room
You'd think it'd get a lot easier without you

[Verse 2]
But you were right
There's so much shit inside my mind
I must confess the second time
A lot of friends have left my lifе
Escaping my tractor beam of woe
One small kiss and off thеy go
Crying in deep vibrato

[Refrain]
Midday missionary
Late night loathing
Midnight cowgirl
Morning smoking

Me and my girl could go all night (Midday missionary)
My girl's the world, she fucks my life (Late night loathing)
A top-heavy Amazon standing lamp's (Midnight cowgirl)
The only light left in my life
A top-heavy Amazon Basics standing lamp's (Midday missionary)
The only light left in my life

[Outro]
No, it's not you again is it?
