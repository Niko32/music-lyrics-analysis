Let me have some pretty flowers for I've made it
Maybe it may bring some sunshine her way
And put some pretty ribbon round them gently
So she can smell the fragrance every day

[Chorus:]
Let me give her the flowers while she's living
For I don't want to wait until she's gone
Let me give her the flowers while she's living
I can see my mama smile when I get home

[Verse 2:]
Comin' home holds different mem'ries for everybody
For some man has sadness of days gone by
But for me it's the pretty flowers for my mama
Just to see her precious smile in her smilin' eyes

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
I can see my mama smile when I get homeYou might also like
