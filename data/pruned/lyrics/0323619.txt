Well, I used think the color of love would be a rosy red or a pretty pink
And I thought it would be a thirsty man crawling home to get a big old drink
And I thought love was spelled like a bell, B-E-double L bell that you ring
Stead of wham bam hit your man with a pan, hit him on the head and listen to the birdies sing

[Chorus]
Oh, you heart breaking, love making, cut me-a-piece-of-bacon man of mine
Oh, you money shifting, flour sifting, nose lifting rose of woman kind
Just keep on doing what you're doing and what you're doing suits me just fine
And, love, I'll tell you something else, you blow my mind

[Verse 2]
Well, I used to think the color of love would be a soft green like a pea in a pod
And I thought love would strike like a light flashing down a big old lightning rod
And I thought love was spelled W-E-double L well that would never run dry
Stead of choke choke, I'm so broke and dry I can't afford a little bitty tear to cry

[Chorus]
Oh, you money turning, egg churning, butter burning baby of mine You half crazy lean and lazy, pretty as a wilted daisy man of mine Just keep on doing what you're doing and what you're doing suits me just fine
And, love, I'll tell you something else, you blow my mind
You dim light, alright, love me 'til I'm old and going blind
And, love, you're something else, you blow my mindYou might also like
