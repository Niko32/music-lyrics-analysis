The existence of these groups is illegal but the law rests when the sun sets
Gangs of religious militarists
(the state police, a sect with political education and/or policemen the religious education)
Who terminate beggars and bums to protect their moral behavior
By day, like excellent fathers and policemen

The gang of the Clandestine is formed by hardworker's children
Kept from governmental vigilance ever since delivery
Performed by Clandestine doctors
Away from schools that only teach hardworkers to be hardworker's children
The Clandestine are one of the religious favorite gangs to be arrested and tortured
The Green Shirts youngsters, who follow reactionary rues
Are a serviceable arm of the religious military movement

There are some semi-pacific groups like the Drug
Freaks depending on the reaction and the quantity of the drug

The girls who belong to these gangs are more courageous than most of the others
From their very early years, they have been taught not to be libertine
This being related to the fact that they don't get pregnant
With more courage they face the possibility of being arrested in philthy penitentiaries
Till the moment they are sent to S.R.S. (Social Readjustment Square)

The prejudice among the groups is not just a fact in the gangs
The Undergrounds themselves discriminate a lower class, the Homeless
The Uppermost take advantage of this disagreement

Some youngsters get together in forbidden gangs others
Try to be accepted practicing the most popular sport:
The railroad surfing. The first are chased to work
Until death what's left for the late ones is to
Live and die by the rules

In each shadow a gang each one has an objective

Each one look like one another despite all that
No one understands
They're all lost

[Clandestine:]
"We're the gang of the numberless ever since we were born we never had documents
It's hard to talk about a city that doesn't belong to us
We listen to heavy sound. we love our girls. We simply live
This bothers much. Our parents pray for our exile in counter system"

[Clandestine's dad:]
"Counter system is a city separated from ours by a
Castrating wall they say that there are no leaders no orders"

[Clandestine or numberless:]
"What can a youngster want? Fighting in gangs!"
The clandestine idolize the indians a free legendary race people doubt they have existed
The numberless believes it's possible fighting in gangs is what's left

It's in the sky it's the warning from the police come
On let's play the stalker and the prey again
