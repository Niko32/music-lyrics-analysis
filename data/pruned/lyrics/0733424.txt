My phone’s blowin’ up
Everybody wants to know what’s up
When, where, what’s the plan
Well I’ll be there as soon as I can
Yeah I feel like a good time comin’ on
Oh yeah, that’s my song
Turn it up and sing along
Trouble’s gonna melt away
Once we get to doing our thing
Yeah, I feel like a good time comin’ on

[Chorus 1]
Hey y’all what you say
We get this party started
We’ve got all we need to have some fun
Right now it’s all about tonight and not tomorrow
I feel like a good time comin’ on

[Verse 2]
Who’s that over there
I hope he didn’t see me stare
Oh Lord here he comes
Well I don’t wanna jump the gun
But I feel like a good time comin’ on
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Hey boy what you say
We get this party started
We’ve got all we need to have some fun
Right now it’s all about tonight and not tomorrow
I feel like a good time comin’ on

[Bridge]
My phone’s blowin’ up
(My phone’s blowin’ up)
Everybody wants to know what’s up
(Everybody wants to know what’s up)
Hey girl where’d you go
Well all they really need to know

[Outro]
Is I feel like a good time
I feel like a good time comin’ on
It’s comin’ on… comin’ on
