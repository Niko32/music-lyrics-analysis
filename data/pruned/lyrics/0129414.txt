Where do you think you're going?
Don't you know it's dark outside?
Where do you think you're going?
Don't you care about my pride?
Where do you think you're going?
I think a-you don't know
You got no way of knowing
'Cause you've got no place you can go

[Verse]
I understand your changes
How long before you reach the door
I know where you think you're going
I know what you came here for
And now I'm sick of joking
You know I like you to be free
A-where do you think you're going?
I think you'd better go with me, girl
You say there is no reason
But you still find cause to doubt me
When you ain't with me, girl
You're going to be without me, yeah

[Chorus]
Where do you think you're going?
Don't you know it's dark outside?
Where do you think you're going?
I wish I didn't care about my pride
And now I'm sick of joking
You know I like you to be free, girl
Where do you think you're going?
I think you'd better go with me, girl

Come on!
Hey!
