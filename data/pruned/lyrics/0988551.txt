We are lost and cursed
How I can explain this being worst

How we all decided to break all our lives in two
Always
One step further, two more backward, towards you

Don't choke on breathing
Walking through the red lights
Heaven is full of souls
Here there ain't no more signs

All I can see right now
Is covered up with dust
And what I'm looking for is
Flesh and blood

Don't choke on breathing
Don't bid sight in the light
X2

How we all decided to break all our lives in two
Always
One step further, two more backward, to the truth
You might also likeYou walk on by this battle field
And break out since you chose to live
This lonely grave, cold stones and hush

And now this place is crying out
Can you hear it?

This is what i see
A cold and brave new world
Where every feeling
Now seems to be gone
