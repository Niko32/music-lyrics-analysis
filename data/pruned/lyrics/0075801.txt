[Verse 1:Yung Astro]
Im Offically Offical to Be the Official
Because I Ball and the Defense of Linmen will getchu
These niggas so easy to handle like a handle pistol
I use Refigarated Magnets to Spell my Initials
Now, I spell my Initials on paper and napkins
And give them all out to my Friends to show them whats happenin
My Twitter Name Is @ Lanta but im Not a Falcon
But my swag is hotter than a Desert fill with bunch of cactus
Wearin Khakis
V-Neck with a Snapy
Plus its black in yellow wiz khalifa in a taxi
Before you knew the name, you said a nigga was lame
The defition of fame, look it up and you'll say that's me
That's me on the top hore
Bitches know I ball thats me on the top score
You say you in the building that's me on the top floor
And when im done, all these niggas want is a encore
4real

[Verse 2:Yung Astro]
You want feel me to you want it so bad, you tell your self you own it
And tell niggas around here that this is your time and moment
And walk up with your head up like you dont have a opponent
And watch me kill all you lil niggas like im kony
So I dont mess with fony's
Its 5 a.m. feelin like 3 in the noon
These niggas fall like a bag with some leaves and a broom
I got keys to your room, now do you see me
Walk up to your door you here my cd with me in the room
Yea, that was a punchline I swear its real
When I get up on the track, I swear its real
Haa, I would never settle for less
On top of the billboard it says im the fuckin best
Yo, your music never pop your just a cold Sickle
Left me hangin to die, Missle toe Missle
Run the game but I never drive stick
So of yall niggas can't my shit, dollar store tissue
Doin me dont really care what the haters say
Snapback with some chucks, shouts of to taylor gang
5 star yes we ball like the lakers play
Haters fade away, when I hit them with the fadeaway
Best believe its about that time
That I get on my hustle and that I get on my grind
Yall niggas kids to my knee, and I ain't talkin bout spine
And ima live and won't stop until its call for my time, Whoa!
