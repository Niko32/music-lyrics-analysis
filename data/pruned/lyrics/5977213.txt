I sit alone
Hoping you'll get home soon
Darling, come home soon
Darling, come home soon

I sit in my room
Each and every night
Wondering how you are
Are you feeling all alone
For I miss you so

(I'm writing to you, so sad and blue)
For I love you so
(So sorry dear, wish you were here)
And I'll never let you go
(Each night, un-der this moon)
I sit in my room
Hereâ€™s hoping you'll get home soon
Darling come home soon
Darling, come home soon
