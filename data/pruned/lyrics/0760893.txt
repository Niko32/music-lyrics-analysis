Someone who loves you for who you are
Someone who's promises won't break
Honey, I've got what it takes

You need a man with a tender touch
Two strong arms to wrap you up
And love all your nights away
Baby, I've got what it takes

Girl you can search to the ends of the earth
If that's what you need to do
But under all the stars there's just one heart
Meant for lovin' you
And I'm gonna prove to you babe
I've got what it takes

You need a man who'll walk the line
Standin' right here by your side
Until his dyin' day
Darlin', I've got what it takes

Girl you can search to the ends of the earth
If that's what you need to do
But under all the stars there's just one heart
Meant for lovin' you
And I'm gonna prove to you babe
I've got what it takes
You might also likeGirl you can search to the ends of the earth
If that's what you need to do
But under all the stars there's just one heart
Meant for lovin' you
And I'm gonna prove to you baby
I've got what it takes

And I'm gonna prove to you baby
I've got what it takes

You need a man with an honest heart
Baby, I've got what it takes...
