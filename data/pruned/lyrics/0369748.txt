And I can't believe it's real
Can't believe it's you
I can't believe it's happening
I can't believe it's true
And I can't believe that you are here with me
And I am here with you

[Chorus]
(Kissing you) Softly kissing you
(Kissing you) Forever kissing you
(Kissing you) Kissing you

[Verse 2]
Can't believe my eyes
I don't know what to do
I can't believe that you are mine
Nor that I'm lying here with you
And I can't believe you're making love with me
And I'm making it with you

[Chorus]
(Kissing you) Softly kissing you
(Kissing you) Forever kissing you
(Kissing you) Kissing you
You might also like[Bridge]
Through the night, I feel your fire
And there's nothing but you in my mind
As you quench me of all my desires
And I melt in ecstasy, oh, oh, I
I can't believe it's real (can't believe it's real)
I can't believe it's true (can't believe it's true)
I can't believe that you chose me
When I was choosing you
(Can't believe when I was choosing you)
And I can't believe that you are here with me
And I am here with you

[Chorus]
(Kissing you) Softly kissing you
(Kissing you) Forever kissing you
(Kissing you) Oh, gently kissing you
(Kissing you) Kissing you
(Kissing you) Kissing you
(Kissing you) Oh, kissing you
