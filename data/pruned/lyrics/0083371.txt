From beyond this bed of mine I see
Ceiling fans with you on top of me
And the window blinds are filled with rays of sun
And all you secret fantasies thy will be done (done)
And inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn
(That will feast your body all night)
If we keep this up then a love child will be born
All because of the greatest

[Chorus]
The greatest you
The greatest me
We have found the greatest chemistry
The greatest touch
The greatest kiss
What came to be is the greatest wish (it's the greatest)
The greatest show
The greatest song
The greatest words
The greatest all night long (your love stays)
Baby your love stays constantly on my mind
This is the best sex I've ever had

[Verse 2]
I know twelve ways to make your love come down
And the secret places on you will be found
Like a voyage when the storm begins to roar
There's no telling what this night could have in store, in store
'Cause inside of your walls there will dwell a Capricorn
(That will feast your body all night)
And if we keep this up then a love child will be born
All because of the greatest
You might also like[Chorus]
The greatest you (ooh yeah)
The greatest me
We have found the greatest chemistry
The greatest touch
The greatest kiss
What came to be is the greatest wish
The greatest show (woo!)
The greatest song
The greatest words
The greatest all night long (baby you stay)
Baby your love stays constantly on my mind
This is the best sex I've ever had
The greatest you (yes, it is)
The greatest me
We have found the greatest chemistry
The greatest touch
The greatest kiss (woah, ooh yeah)
What came to be is the greatest wish (this is greatest)
The greatest show (oh, yeah)
The greatest song
The greatest words
The greatest all night long (baby your love)
Baby your love stays constantly on my mind
It's the greatest sex I've ever had
The greatest you
The greatest me (greatest me)
We have found (we have found) the greatest chemistry
(Something that heaven has ordained for the sake of our love)
The greatest touch
The greatest kiss
(Like a hand and glove we go together
This love is forever, ooh yeah)
What came to be is the greatest wish
The greatest show
The greatest song (greatest song)
The greatest words (the greatest words)
The greatest all night long (your love)
Baby your love stays constantly on my mind
The sex so good I've got to break it down
