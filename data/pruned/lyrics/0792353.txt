Come into my window ‘cause I live not far away
They’re tempting me to come back to the things we used to do
But the honky tonk and lonely songs I left behind when I left you
The nightlife with its parties that’s your style of being gay
Although it meant I lost your love I couldn’t live that way
I hope some day you’ll think enough of me and try to change
And come away from the honky tonk back into my arms again
