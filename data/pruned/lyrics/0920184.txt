'Cause it starts within her heart and flows throughout her soul
With a genuine reflection on her face
She's a lady, and she doesn't have to prove it to the world
There's kindness in her eyes and wisdom in her words
And in her heart sometimes a little girl
She's a natural and it isn't hard to see
Though I'm not quite sure just what she sees in me
But God in all his kindness gave her sweet sweet love to me
And as long as I have life, I'm going to love her, naturally
She's a rare thing, a treasure most men seek but seldom find
A priceless work of art from the hands of the maker
That only grows more valuable with time
She's an angel, the nearest thing to heaven that I have found
She eases all my burdons, she takes me high above it
And still she keeps my feet right on the ground
She's a natural and it isn't hard to see
Though I'm not quite sure just what she sees in me
But god in all his kindness gave her sweet sweet love to me
And as long as I have life, I'm going to love her, naturally
Oh, she's a naturalYou might also like
