You say you want it all
To dip your fingers in the green
You say you want it all
The sun the moon and what's in between
You say you want it all
You want the world to know your face
Baby, haven't you heard every star can be replaced?
Ride the product line, hop in your box but don't protest
You've just been signed to the three-ring bull shit business
It's a playa's ball and the pimps come in black and white
And that's about all as I turn in this song to my pimp tonight…

[Chorus]
You ask me how you can win
How many walls you gon have to break down to get in
As you’re steady pushing through
Don't let it be breaking you

[Verse 2:]
Some who have it all
The one big shiny life
They selling us a story they know that we gonna buy
But don't you let them fool you baby
They can't sleep at night
The mirror shows a reflection of
A person that they don't like
Ride the product line, hop in your box but don't protest
You've just been signed to the three-ring bull shit business
Leave your brain at the door and
Hang it up with your originality
I can't say no more
'Cause if I do then they won't let you hear from me
You might also like[Chorus]

[Bridge]
There ain't no real love up in here, there ain’t no
There ain't no real love up in here, there ain’t no
If you’re looking for real love up in here, if you looking for
Gotta bring your own real love up in here, bring your own

[Chorus]
