Just say come on let's be alone babe
Just say you want to spend some time with me
Just say anywhere we are
It's all about love and anything we want to be
Just say you feel the fire burning
Just say the sun only shines on your face
Just say this love can last forever
I want to show you how much I want to know you
There's a dream that I'm dreaming inside my head
And I know just right where we are going
Come on and take this ride
Just come on inside and make this dream reality

[Chorus]
Let's both just getaway
Your smile's my holiday
Don't you know that you're my sweet vacation

[Verse 2]
Just say just put your heart in my hand
Just say I'll lay the whole world at your feet
Just say we're going on a journey
I can't deny what I'm feeling inside
I see the joy I see the laughter we just don't care
Happiness will never leave us alone
You know there's such a place
A wonderful place where love can find you and me
Ooh let's getaway, right now
You might also like[Chorus] 2X
Let's both just getaway
Your smile's my holiday
Don't you know that you're my sweet vacation

[Bridge]
When I think about you baby (Wanna love you)
When I talk about you baby (Wanna love you)
What I say about you baby  (Wanna love you)
The world should know about you baby (Needa tell it)
Because I really need you baby (Wanna love you)
Because I really love you baby (Love you baby)
See I really miss you baby
Let's getaway

[Chorus]
Let's both just getaway
Your smile's my holiday
Don't you know that you're my sweet vacation

[Outro]
Through storms we'll find the stars
Sometimes they tell us who we are
