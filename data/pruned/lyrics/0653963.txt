Selene, Apollo, Odin, and Thor
Isis, Astarte, and Diana
Hecate, Demeter, Kali, Inanna

(Chorus)
Fill the horn, pass it through the fire
Feel the energy getting higher
This full moon we'll hold a circle
And drink in your honor

This round's for those who've passed on
My mother and father and those who are gone
You have somehow touched our lives
And we celebrate you tonight

(Repeat Chorus)

This round's for whatever we choose
Life's a game you can win or you lose
I choose to live free and proud
So take the horn and pass it around

(Repeat Chorus)You might also like
