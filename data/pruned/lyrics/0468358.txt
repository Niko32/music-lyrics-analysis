Maybe try some drugs
Maybe try some weed
Maybe try some coke
Maybe try some speed
Maybe overdose, overfulfill your needs
Off of some painkiller pills, now buddy you feeling me?
I'm filling up my cup like a couple double Ds
Pop a couple mollies go for more and then I double these
And I begin to see in double thanks to the Hennessy
Double shot of vodka, double trouble, I begin to pee
Urinating everywhere and anywhere, my derriere is toast
Toast to the means of medication I love most
It's a party after all, do like these men do
Let's have a look tonight at what's on the menu
Fifteen blunts, eight-five damn kilos
Ninety-seven mollies, I want more, hand me those
Three-fifths of vodka just like slavery legislation
And pump up the bass and let it play, G, this my station
Pool full of liquor, out the way, I'm finna dive in
Give me my damn keys, you ain't stopping me from driving!
Hop in the Accord and hit the gas pedal and go
Get safely home, go to my room, take more, and promptly overdose
And now I'm dead
