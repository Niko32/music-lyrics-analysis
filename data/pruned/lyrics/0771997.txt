Baby, you’ve been my love and my friend
You’ve been here through thick and thin
For that, baby, I love
All I want to do is talk, talk, talk about you

[Refrain]
And I’m here to say, yeah
Gonna love you just a little bit more each day
Now just want to tell the world
Tell them that I love you, I love you so, yes, I do

[Verse 2]
Now they didn’t put me down because
'Cause I love you, I love you as much as I do
What it is they didn’t know? Didn’t know what you’ve done for me
You’ve made such a happy girl out of me

[Refrain]
And I’m here to say, yes, I am
I’m gonna love you just a little bit more each day
And I’m telling the world, I’m telling them
I’m telling them that I love, that I love you so, yeah, yes, I am

[Chorus]
I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby

They can now to say that I am wrong
Because my love, my love is strong
There’s only one that I place above
It’s God that I place above you

[Refrain]
And I’m here to say, I’m standing right here to say
I’m gonna love you, love you, love you just a little bit more each day
And I’m telling the world, I want them to hear
That I love, I love you, I love you, love you, love you so

[Chorus]
I love, I love, I love, oooh, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
I love, I love, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby
I love, I love, I love, oooh, I love, I love, I love every little thing about you, baby

[Outro]
Oooh, the way you wear your clothes
The way you stand up and just feel free, go man, I love, I love you
Oooh, I love you, baby, love you, baby, love you, baby, love you, baby
