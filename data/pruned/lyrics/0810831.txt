So far away
Curses wild upon you
Hungry and gaining
Porchlight burns so far away
Miles away

Days have gone by and I've barely gone
Safe on the road that speeds from your front door
I can't turn around 'cause I long to be forgiven

It hangs in my hair and the hems of my clothes
I've poured in the madness my arms could not hold
I can't tell you why 'cause I long to be forgiven

[Chorus]
So far away
Curses wild upon you
Hungry and gaining
Porchlight burns so far away
Miles away

I'm sorry to tread on your patience, my dear
My heart might be willing by this time next year
I can't make you wait 'cause I long to be forgiven
You might also like[Chorus]
So far away
Curses wild upon you
Hungry and gaining
Porchlight burns so far away
Miles away
