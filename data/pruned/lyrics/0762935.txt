Where every curve feels like a friend
I've traveled north and south since I was born for family, friends, love, and war
I know this road from end to end, hiyiyi
This is my coast, this is my home, from San Diego up to Nome
Haven't seen it all yet but I will
And I want to memorize it, every inch, want to remember where I've been
I bless these waves, I bless this wind, I bless this grace and all my sins
I mean to take the side streets where I can, maps and the cost of gas be damned
The miles are only miles for me
So I breeze through my familiar ports of call, Rice Hill, Ukiah, Kelso, all
Right where I know they’re s’posed to be, hiyiyi...
Looks to be a year of go and touch -- leaning on my coffee like a crutch
With shards of daydreams in my hands
And the hot springs and the cold creeks, the lonely Bay and the long long weeks
Will frame my jokes & penetrate my plans, hiyiyi ...
Road'll grind you down you give it time, but there are those that don’t much mind
Our corners start to curving 'til we shine
Traveling don’t make me special, no, I am just one more lonely soul
Trying hard to try hard to stay kind, yiyiyi
This is my ghost, this is my home -- millions of miles my mind can’t own
No one’s seen it all; no one will
But I want to memorize it, every inch, want to remember where I’ve been
I bless these waves, I bless this wind, bless this grace & all my sinsYou might also like
