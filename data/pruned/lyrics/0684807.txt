Be still my soul when I see your face smiling next to hers
My heart is hanging in the balance, I can't breathe because it burns
I never thought I'd ever see the day when, I'd be afraid to feel
I'm broken down as I hit the ground. How can this be real?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't think you'll ever know the pain that you can cause
Job well done, you've left me crushed, I think you deserve some applause

[Chorus]
Never you mind that I'm tortured crying lying awake at night
Never you mind that I'm haunted by the echos of your lies
Never you mind that I can't escape the ache of your goodbyes
Never you mind, never you mind

[Verse 2]
You were the sweetest kind of addiction running through my veins
But you pulled the rug out from underneath me
How quickly you could change
I hope you're proud of how you played the game and your power over me
Cause I'm still wrapped around your finger,too tightly to break free

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Bridge]
(Maybe I'm not the man you wanted me to be)
Never you mind
(I ran from promises I knew I couldn't keep)
Never you mind
(you are the only one who saw inside my chest)
Did you ever care? Did you ever care? Did you ever care one bit about me?
