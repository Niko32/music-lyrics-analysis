I'm from the southern hemisphere of the globe
Where women love the accent and we murder the flow
Bourbon and coke, spit like the tourniquet broke
Take the drip and stick in you with a permanent poke
Learn when I joke, I ask myself with so serious
I'ma let ya/ledger in on a secret of most lyricists
Most of the time we laugh and gloat, but if you part the smoke
You would see we're smart alone and live in only half a home
I lost my father, while others lost partners
Is my lounge a living room or gateway for departures?
Is my down a sinking doom, or something much faster?
Van gogh for the high I'm related to dutch masters
No class passer I'm failing my degree
I'm depressed and I'm f'ed like the grades I always see
I'm a mess, but I guess I can blame it on the grief
But I won't and If I did  then I'd deserve what I receive
But I...

(Verse 2)
I'm from a world thats incredibly private
Unless you hear me speak it exists in silence
I lay it on a beat for you to keep and decide if
You'd rather see the dream, or believe in the nightmare
I'm square, but I'm walking in circles
Tried angles/triangles are wrecked angles/rectangles if you don't know how to work em
I'm a person using music to negate the sad
Don't hate myself but the mirror sure makes me mad
I could fade to black, thoughts of jay-z
He wrote a blueprint for the hustlers, but never one for me
And it's funny I've got customers paying me for beats
But you don't believe the beast until he's lying through his teeth
Living on a lease, eat, sleep, then I work too
This shit isn't a job, it's a block so I don't hurt you
Play me at your spot when you're breaking all your curfews
My ex couldn't wait for this, patience is a virtue girl...

Knock Knock, you can let me in
Aren't you sick of the innocent letting the villain win?
Said you're sick of the innocent letting the villain win
Sick of the vigilant letting the villain in
YO
Knock Knock, let the right one in
It's a rat race and someone put a python in
Feel the fire, it's crawling under my skin
Feel the fire yes yes, it's crawling under my skin
