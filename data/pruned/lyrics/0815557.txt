There was times I didn't wanna bother you
You were at work all night, I didn't wanna complain
And I realize the compromise that loved ones make
I'm holding on for the future
Some more better days with you

[Chorus]
Be without you
(I wouldn't be without your lovin')
Oh wouldn't be with out you
(I wouldn't be without your love)
Oh, I live for your love (Oh, oh)
For you (You, you, you), ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Say a word, I'm there when you need me
My job is to protect you, although I know
That women get emotional, in need of love
So I tried to learn your species, and one day we'll grow
Grow

[Chorus]
Be without you
(I wouldn't be without your lovin')
Oh, wouldn't be with out you
(I wouldn't be, baby)
Oh, I live for your love
(I live for your lovin')
For you (You, you), ooh-ooh

(Oh, oh) I live for ya, live ya
(Oh) Uh-huh (Oh), I live for your lovin', baby
(Oh, oh) Uh-huh
(Oh, oh) Uh-huh
(Without you) Without your lovin', baby

[Chorus]
Be without you
(I wouldn't be without you)
Oh, wouldn't be with out you
(Oh no, I wouldn't be)
Oh, I live for your love
(I live for your lovin', baby)
For you, ooh-ooh

[Outro]
I wouldn't be without you
I couldn't live without you
Never gonna smile without you
Don't wanna be without you, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, with you, you, you
You
