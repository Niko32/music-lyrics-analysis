Quiet chords from my guitar
Floating on the silence
That surrounds us

Quiet nights and quiet dreams
Quiet walks by quiet streams
And the window looking on the mountains
And the sea, how lovely

This is where to be
Here with you so close to me
Till the final flicker of life's ember

I, who was lost and lonely
Believing life was a only a bitter tragic joke
Have found with you
The meaning of existence, oh, my love

This is where to be
Here with you so close to me
Till the final flicker of life's ember

I, who was lost and lonely
Believing life was a only a tragic joke
Have found with you
The meaning of existence, oh, my loveYou might also like
