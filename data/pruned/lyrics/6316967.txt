Way down south in Alabama
I got a friend, they call dancin' Sammy
Who's crazy about all the latest dancin'
Black Bottom Stomps and the new pretty prances
The other night at a swell affair
Soon as the boys found out that I was there
They said, "Come on, Ma, let's go to the cabaret"
When I got there they began to say

[Chorus]
I want to see the dance you call the black bottom
I wanna learn that dance
Want to see the dance you call your big black bottom
That puts you in a trance
All the boys in the neighborhood
They say your black bottom is really good
Come on and show me your black bottom
I wanna learn that dance

[Chorus]
I want to see the dance they call the black bottom
I wanna learn that dance
Want to see the dance you call your big black bottom
That puts you in a trance
You might also like[Verse]
Early one morning 'bout the break of day
Grandpa told my grandmother, I heard him say
"Get on up and show your old man your black bottom
I want to learn that dance
I want to learn that dance"
