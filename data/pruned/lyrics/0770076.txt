This isn't a catastrophe, I promise
You and I think differently, it's obvious
Let me help you understand
Remember how you said you'd wait here for me?
Well maybe I just took your word, sorry
Then I hear my father's voice about true friends
You can count them on one hand

Well I got five friends who want me
And I got five friends who need me
If you got five friends you're lucky
Still I need one friend to love me

Look at me and try to be truthful
'Cause I already know you ain't been faithful
Makes me realize I should be grateful
I got a place to put my head

Well I got five friends who want me
And I got five friends to hold me
If you got five friends you're lucky
Still I need one friend to love me

Hey yeah wha wow wow
Yeah yeah yeah
Woo

Well I got five friends who want me
And I got five friends to hold me, baby baby
If you got five friends you're lucky, you know it
Still I need one friend to love me
