Break it down (4x)

[Verse 1]
I bought a new house today
I guess it's just okay
Got a pool by the fire place
And a 90 foot hall way
But all I got to say
It's something about this place
That makes this special
Is when I see your face

[Chorus]
I enjoy the view
I love seeing you
I enjoy the view
I be checkin for you
I can't wait to see you (6x)
I be checkin checkin checkin for you
I can't wait to see you (6x)
I be checkin checkin checkin for you

[Verse 2]
I want you to know
That I enjoy your show
You have the brightest glow
You shine right through my window
I just want to tell you face to face
How you make my day
When I see your face
You might also like[Bridge]
Break it down (4x)

[Chorus]
