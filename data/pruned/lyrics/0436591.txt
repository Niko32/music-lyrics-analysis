Sometimes, you love me
Like a good man ought to
Sometimes, you hurt me so bad
My tears run like water
You get me out
Not before your friends
And then you disown me, baby
Until we're alone again

[Chorus]
Your love is like a seesaw
Your love is like a seesaw, baby
Your love is like a seesaw
Going up (Up), down (Down), and all around
Like a seesaw

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, you tell me
You're gon' be my sweet candy man
And then sometimes, baby
Never know where I stand
You lift me up
When I'm on the ground
But as soon as I get uptown
You send me tumblin' down
You might also like[Chorus]
Now your love is like a seesaw
Your love is like a seesaw, baby
Your love is like a seesaw
Going up (Up), down (Down), and all around
It's like a seesaw

[Bridge]
When I kiss you and I like it
And I ask you to kiss me again
When I reach for you, you jump clean outta sight
You change just like the wind
That ain't right, that ain't right
That ain't right, that ain't right, baby (It ain't right)

[Outro]
Your love is like a seesaw
Your love is like a seesaw, baby
You love is like a seesaw
Going up (Up), down (Down), and all around
It's like a seesaw
Your love is like a seesaw
Your love is like a seesaw, baby
You love is like a seesaw
Going up (Up), down (Down), and all around
It's like a see saw, yeah, seesaw, baby (Seesaw)
