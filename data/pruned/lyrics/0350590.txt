Since I was 16 I've thought that life would change and I could get things
Like a Roley and a sixteen on a beat with Pac and Biggie
Off a Philly out in Philly
Maybe LA gettin billies
Do y'all feel me am I palpable
Or trippin' off this afterglow?
I just took some tabs and now I'm pastor of the past
And movin faster than the future
These blunts is like Medusa
Used to lean but now I levitate
Facts is what I had to break
Fate is what I calculate
To great is where I gravitate
Do ya, think that life is better being broke?
Hold up, I saw a starving man just asking for a smoke
He said he prayed a million times but only prayed for hope
What a drug, and I swear we're all addicted to the dope
Load up, roll up, blow it on the Murci√©lago
Success is like a lotto
Learn to play it then you win, right?
Specially if your skins rights
But fuck it I'ma get my ends right

Practice brought this sinner flow
Finna blow like I'm
Mary Kate or maybe Miley
'bout to buy an island just so
I can say I have an island
I'm the sickest rapper ever
I might die before this letter dries
So don't you ever wonder why
I write and let my letter cry

Hope is dope
Got me writing notes and spitting fire quotes
A lot of tokes get me hella focused on a higher plan
I just know we just in a spiral
Deep within my mind
Took the time to just analyze
That it's not the time
So I grind, gotta get this money dawg
I'm funny bout this money dawg
Holy only gets your money loaning to a phony law
What I need is elitist shit
See the yacht and go be in it
Many niggas can't read n shit
So I do it for my mind
One time for my niggas on the row
Like my niggas on the boat doing anything for hope
I'm the product of a prospect of a prosperous way
I got the lock and the key
I got the answers for Sway
I got the Torah out and open, anyone in the way
I tell my people look in glass if they just wanting to pray
And I say, hope is dope
Hope is dope
