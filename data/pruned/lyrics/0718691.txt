Yeah, these late nights aren't what they used to be
Traded fireflies for every headlight that I see
The country roads that raised me, I see them now but as a memory
Everything's good, everything's fine
It's somebody's home but it'll never be mine

[Chorus]
You and me riding 'round in the Chevy
Two green lights and we're out of the city
It's all I've ever known, when I don't know where to go
Got no jobs and we got no money
Got no cares when we hit the ground running
Nothin' but summer sky
Just living that simple life

[Verse 2]
All this sunshine, I'm just wishin' it would rain
A thousand faces, but not one of them knows my name
'Cause I say goodbye to what feels right
Football games on a Friday night
Everything's good, everything's fine
It's somebody's home but it'll never be mine

[Chorus]
You and me riding 'round in the Chevy
Two green lights and we're out of the city
It's all I've ever known, when I don't know where to go
Got no jobs and we got no money
Got no cares when we hit the ground running
Nothin' but summer sky
Just living that simple life
You might also like[Bridge]
Just like the seasons change
I know things will never be the same
I'd give it all just to feel that way again
When it was

[Chorus]
You and me riding 'round in the Chevy
Two green lights and we're out of the city
It's all I've ever known, when I don't know where to go
Got no jobs and we got no money
Got no cares when we hit the ground running
Nothin' but summer sky
Just living that simple life

[Chorus]
You and me riding 'round in the Chevy
Two green lights and we're out of the city
It's all I've ever known, when I don't know where to go
Got no jobs and we got no money
Got no cares when we hit the ground running
Nothin' but summer sky
Just living that simple life

[Outro]
I'd leave this all behind
To just live that simple life
