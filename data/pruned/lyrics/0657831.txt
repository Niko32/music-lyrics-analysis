I'm a grown ass woman dawg
Ion worry bout you
I mind my business
That's what grown folk do

I'm a grown ass woman dawg
Certain games ion play
Get 2 quick jabs in the face

I'm a grown ass woman dawg
I'm fuck shit free
You messy hoes can't sit up under me
When you grown you focusing on your future
Fuck a hater or the next bitch
Blah blah blah
Cut the check bitch
I'm a grown ass woman dawg

[1st verse]
Don't gossip round me
Fuck round and punched in the teeth
Ion wanna hear a muthafucking thang about Shonte business
(ughh) the Lord is my witness
I'll been done caught a charge entertaining you messy ass
Petty ass
Never going steady ass
Fucked out
Meddling ass hoes
Shopping at them ghetto ass stores
Touch your big ghetto ass nose
Don't worry bout me
I always been a 'G'
And I learn when I listen
Ain even tryna speak
Tell that hoe nigga this
He acting like a bitch
Prolly got him in his feelings
Cause I'm killing his bitch
Like it's my fault they'nt feeling that shit
Survey says I'm killing this shit
Fuck a nigga hating, perpetrating
I be somewhere venelating
Cloud 10 gotta maximize my current situation
Nope yeen gotta like I
But I promise all you haters gone respect my mind
And respect my grind
Yeen gotta speak
Subscribe to the website
Yeen gotta sneak
Ain never been petty
The streets say I'm ready
I done fell off at the waist
Now you bitches finna get it
Shut it down every town
And I'm leaving with the crown
Got ya nigga and ya daughter screaming Team Beema now
You might also like[Chorus]

[2nd verse]
Talking big shit on the internet
See me in the streets, bitch gimmie that
So much to say
But when you see me, youn't look my way
Those the games that lil girls play
Lemme tell you bout me
Seven times three
Twelve plus nine
However you break it down
I'm 21 bout mines
No time to waste so stay in a child's place
If it's really on ya chest
Say it to a bitch face
I'm out here getting money
Fuck beefing with the next bitch
Ain got the problem
Ask that bitch
I'm either driving the Beema, Audi, Jag, or the Lex bitch
Blah blah blah cut the check bitch
I keep the engine running
Ain tryna be funny
But you paying in rent
I prolly spend in gas money
I'm loyal to one nigga
Don't matter he riding with me
I'm flyer than a drone and my gits they flying with me
Educated
Don't mistake it
I speak hood shit fluent
Fuck around and get ya grill ruined
Youn't want this pressure
Bitch you better go your direction
Fuck around and catch the wrong blessing
Teach you this lesson
Bluffing with ya cards
Getcha shit pulled
Tell me what's a yorkie to a pit bull?
Eww eww eww
And it's still
Fuck a hater or the next bitch
Blah blah blah
Cut the check bitch
[Chorus]
