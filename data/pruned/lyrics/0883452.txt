Fortold in ancient rhymes
The screams of a million souls
The king rise from his grave
Coursing throught our veins
The vengeance of a
Thousand years
We bring judgment
The burning reward
The gift of pain

On burning wings we ride
Flames are streaming from
Our eyes
Empires fall as we pass by
From the ashes the phoenix
Will rise

(chorus)
Swords are raised on high
And the flames are rising higher
Scorching the sky with our spite
We are rising from the flames

From the gates of eternal
Damnation
Sailing the lake of fire
Raging warriors raging fire
Heel now walks the land
You might also likeOn burning wings we ride
Flames are streaming from
Our eyes
Empires fall as we pass by
From the ashes the phoenix
Will rise

(chorus x2)
