It's the bible against the bottle
In the battle for Daddy's soul
It's momma against the party girls
Over who's gonna win control
On Sunday it's Rock of Ages
On Monday let the good times roll
It's the bible against the bottle
In the battle for Daddy's soul

[Verse 1]
If faith can move a mountain
Moma's gonna win
But even momma will admit
There's a whole lot goin' for sin
With sweet red wine and party girls
And the big-time songs to sing
Maybe she could tell daddy
That's really the swingin' thing

[Chorus]
It's the bible against the bottle
In the battle for Daddy's soul
It's momma against the party girls
Over who's gonna win control
On Sunday it's Rock of Ages
On Monday let the good times roll
It's the bible against the bottle
In the battle for Daddy's soul
You might also like[Verse 2]
Well, I just can't help believing
Momma's gonna win
The milk of human kindness
Is a whole lot stronger than gin
With faith in God and daily prayer
And gospel songs to sing
Momma keeps a-showin' daddy
God's love is a precious thing

[Chorus]
It's the bible against the bottle
In the battle for Daddy's soul
It's momma against the party girls
Over who's gonna win control
On Sunday it's Rock of Ages
On Monday let the good times roll
It's the bible against the bottle
In the battle for Daddy's soul
It's the bible against the bottle
In the battle for Daddy's soul
It's momma against the party girls
Over who's gonna win control
On Sunday it's Rock of Ages
On Monday let the good times roll
It's the bible against the bottle
In the battle for Daddy's soul
