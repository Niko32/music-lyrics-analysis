Look at how your ignorance led your ass to prison
Praying for the life you originally envisioned
But you're never gonna have it because of all your bad decisions
Dreaming you could take it back, redact, and make revisions
Revisit every moment and redo the things you didn't
Insisting on the vision of a better life in deed
You decide to rewind through time and take heed
And may be you'll make peace with people you made bleed
Lately you may see the reason you hate me
Is faintly related to vain deeds. That ain't me
Me is the illusion of the man you thought you are
Deceptively producing feelings that I know are false
I operate in silence to this day I ain't been caught
I'm the cause of all your problems and I do it without force
I con you into thinking the idea of me is you
But see the truth is you are love and all I am is fear
I'll pawn your soul for pennies on the dollar I revere
You wanna know the secret that I've hidden all these years?
All you've gotta do is ask and poof! I'll disappear
See yourself for who you are is Love and nothing else
Remember you descended from the heavens when you fellYou might also like
