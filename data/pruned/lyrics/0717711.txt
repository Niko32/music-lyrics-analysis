Let me tell y'all a little story

[Verse 1: Colt Ford]
Growin' up I remember one year
My uncle Titus had a bright idear
He's gonna bottle up his own brew
Figured he could make a million or two
Taste wasn't gonna be his claim to fame
What he was bankin' on was all in the name
He called it

[Chorus: Trent Tomlinson]
Titty's Titty's Titty's Beer
Just the thing to get you grinnin' ear to ear
Whether you're from the country or a big ol' city
One things for sure everybody loves Titty's

[Verse 2: Colt Ford]
He had his marketing plan worked up
He's gonna sell 'em all in big ol' jugs
He wouldn't package 'em in a six pack
He's gonna sell 'em by the pair and call it a rack
And he was sure it was the next big thing
With Dolly Parton in his ad campaign
Selling

Titty's Titty's Titty's Beer
Just the thing to get you grinnin' ear to ear
Whether you're from the country or a big ol' city
One things for sure everybody loves Titty's

[Interlude]
Somebody get a nipple for that thing

[Bridge: Colt Ford]
Happy hour two for one
Talkin' 'bout a beer buzz son
After work at the ball game or shootin' the bull
Anytime is the right time for a big ol' hand full of

[Chorus: Trent Tomlinson]
Titty's Titty's Titty's Beer
Just the thing to get you grinnin' ear to ear
Whether you're from the country or a big ol' city
One things for sure everybody loves Titty's
One things for sure everybody loves Titty's

[Outro: Colt Ford & Trent Tomlinson]
When you work real hard and your day's gone shitty
What could be better than a big ol' mouthful of Titty's
Come on boys, girls too
Hey Colt lets get us a six pack on that motor boat
Yeah
I like 'em cold
Me too
You know what, somebody get me a pair of them I'm thirsty
Ohh wee
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Ahh, yeah
