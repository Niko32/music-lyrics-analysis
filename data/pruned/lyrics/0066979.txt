My Birth was an exam, math was the one final/
If life was the fatality, I am the one spinal/
Combonic move, I sonic boom but I ain’t shifting crowds/
Black rise from the white powder and scream it loud/
Cocaine rush, watch my propane bust/
Get dope brain, father kids homie – old man’s nut/
I’m a smooth, rude, crude, intelligent schmuck/
I spit bullets ill-logic watch irrelevants duck/
Like Pelicans cluck and Chickens fly, my Charles Dickens cry/
Men to cheat to open doors, that’s why women lie/
Test the Kid they can’t even try/
Took paint bristles with permanent ink and leave em dry/

Hook
I’m the Master and King – I put that on everything/
Raps my thing – I put that on everything/
The crowns my ring, married to the game, this is eternal bliss I will never be the same/
The Raps my paint, the beats my canvas, paint vivid pictures as big as Kansas/
Lsk thorough bred, Z.E.D’s the answer, industry’s my dance-floor, the constant dancer/
The Raps my paint, the beats my canvas, paint vivid pictures as big as Kansas/
Lsk thorough bred, Z.E.D’s the answer, industry’s my dance-floor, the constant dancer/

Verse 2
So since the industry’s my dance-floor, I’m doing the hammer dance/
And I’m too legit to quit even stick to an hour glass/
Days of our lives, the Bold beat the beautiful/
Society decayed but the saloon is still beauty-full/
The bars packed filled with crackerjacks, brothers with mean overbites/
Grim-Jaw Jacker-Jack, Holstar is gun-less so I’m supposed to clap it back/
That’s why I only murder tracks, here to extract the cataract/
The Kid’s precise that’s why I’m trying to be mad exact/
Roll in a Blue Phantom suicide doors advancing/
Who the guys who’s glancing, Cupid eyes are trancing/
Stupid thighs harassing, trapped in a Vise and glassed in/

Verse 3
In the beginning was the word, the word was the beginning/
And now it is heard through the world, it is deep in my soul; Translucent/
It’s tattered on my heart – you can’t move it/
Man was made and Woman from Man/
Flesh of my flesh, Bone of my bones, one forever/
Scribe on the stones by forefathers, drawn on the walls by ancestors/
This is an Art that you can’t measure, priceless this is us/
Us is we and we is you, you are me and I am you/
The grand plan, built in the tower of Babel/
Communicate to brethren through common apparel/
It ‘s all in my blood soaked shoulders and shawl x 3
