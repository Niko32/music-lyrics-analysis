Out in California
Oh, out in California
(Out in California)

[Chorus: Bird]
Out in California when the sun goes down
We go drivin' on the outside of town
All geared up for a Saturday night
Baby, jump in the truck better hold on tight
'Cause I'm gon' take you to the country
I'm gon' take you to the country
I'm gon' take you to the country
I'm gon' take you to the country

[Verse 1: Tex]
Dirt roads lets go, jump in the truck come on baby lets roll
Say dirt roads lets go, jump in the truck come on baby lets roll
Now I take you to the country and it ain't for sleepin'
We get to drinkin' you know what I'm thinkin'
Windows foggin' and the tail gate squeakin'
We could hit the country every God damn weekend
Hank the third turned up full blast
Thong on the wheel, black bra on the dash
Ain't no one around when we rollin' in the grass
So you can be loud when I'm smackin' that, ooh
You might also like[Bridge: Bird]
I'm gon' take you to the country girl
I'm gon' take you to the country girl
I'm gon' take you to the country girl
I'm gon' take you to the country girl

[Chorus: Bird]
Out in California when the sun goes down
We go drivin' on the outside of town
All geared up for a Saturday night
Baby, jump in the truck better hold on tight
'Cause I'm gon' take you to the country
I'm gon' take you to the country
I'm gon' take you to the country
I'm gon' take you to the country

[Verse 2: Bird]
I seen you at the bar last Saturday night
You gave me your card and I think its a-bout time
Oh out in the woods I'm gonna take you
The river bed is where I'll lay you
Under the moonlight is where I'll save you and you will save me too
I seen you at the movies and I seen you walk those dreams
And I see every single night in all my fantasies
So let's jump in the truck an' we'll drive away
Slow down and I'll find us a pile of hay stacks
Climb to the top and I'll lay you back
And make love 'til the sun comes up, yeah
[Chorus: Bird]
Out in California when the sun goes down
We go drivin' on the outside of town
All geared up for a Saturday night
Baby jump in the truck better hold on tight
'Cause I'm gon' take you to the country
I'm gon' take you to the country
I'm gon' take you to the country
I'm gon' take you to the country

[Verse 3: Tex]
[?] to the hood tailgate and mattress
Sleepin' bag with a bottle of Jack
It's us and the stars so we can make a racket
Bend you on the bumper let big Tex slap it
Slap it tap it hidden in the brush
Take another sip 'cause I love it when you're buzzed
Ain't no holdin' hands, got no time for love
We in the backroads buck naked baby let's
Know what girl I'm a gon' take you out to the sticks
Know what girl I'm a gon' take you out to the pit
I'm a hit it to the drum when the 15 hits
In a pile of hay or a pile of bricks 'cause

[Bridge: Bird]
I'm gon' take you to the country girl
I'm gon' take you to the country girl
I'm gon' take you to the country girl
I'm gon' take you to the country girl
[Chorus: Bird]
Out in California when the sun goes down
We go drivin' on the outside of town
All geared up for a Saturday night
Baby jump in the truck better hold on tight
'Cause I'm gon' take you to the country
I'm gon' take you to the country
I'm gon' take you to the country
I'm gon' take you to the country

[Outro]
Out in California
