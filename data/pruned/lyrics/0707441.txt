I tried so hard, I tried my best
I gave you my all, and now there is nothing left
You stole my heart, then tore it in two
And now I’m falling apart, and don’t know what to do
Divided by decision, born by the fire
Confused by your words, tempted by desire
I’m living in the present, my mind is on the past
No knowing what I’ll loose
Not knowing what I’ll last
Blinded by fear, drowning in doubt
Struggling to be free, looking for a way out
Yeah!
But I’m still “YoungpeterZ”
I’ll always be there for you, yeah!
Quick money boy
Thank you
I love you
