Who were you thinkin' about?
Who were you thinkin' 'bout?

[Verse 1:]
Were you thinkin' 'bout me, baby
First time she touched your hand?
Were you thinkin' 'bout me, baby?
Did you forget you were my man?
Were you thinking of me when you removed your ring?
Or did you just think I would not think anything?

[Chorus:]
Who were you thinkin' 'bout?
Who were you thinking about?
Who were you thinkin' 'bout?
Who were you thinking about?
Who were you thinkin' about?
Who were you thinking about?

[Verse 2:]
Were you thinkin' bout me, baby
Each time you kissed her lips?
Were you thinkin' bout me, baby
When your hands were on her hips?
Were you thinking of me?
Did she do it like I do?
Did you ever think of anyone but you now?
You might also like[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Were you thinking I would understand?
And that I was a fool
And that I would never suspect
You were doing me wrong?
And tell now me did you feel bad?
Did it feel good?!
Did it feel like you thought it would?
And I would never know?
What you were thinking?!

You sure weren't thinkin' bout me!

Were you thinkin' bout her, baby?
Or were you thinkin' bout you, baby?
You weren't thinkin' bout me!

[Chorus:]
Who were you thinkin' 'bout?
Who were you thinking about?
Said who were you thinkin' 'bout?
Who were you thinking about?
(Say it to me now)
Who were you thinkin' about?
Who were you thinking about?
Said a, who were, who were...
You sure weren't thinkin' 'bout me now!
Sure weren't thinkin' bout me
(Who were you thinkin' 'bout?
Say it to me now)
Now who were you thinkin' 'bout?
Sure weren't thinkin' bout me!
(Who were you thinkin' 'bout?)
Yeah, sure weren't thinkin' bout me!

Who were you thinkin' 'bout?
No, no
(You weren't thinkin' 'bout me!)
You weren't thinkin' bout me baby
Or were you thinkin' 'bout you, baby?
You sure weren't thinkin' bout me!
(Who were you thinkin' 'bout?)
Who were... who were...
(You weren't thinkin' 'bout me!)

Who was it? Hmmm?
It wasn't me
You weren't thinkin' 'bout me!
(Who were you thinkin' 'bout?)
You sure weren't, you sure weren't, you sure weren't
(You weren't thinkin' 'bout me!)
Thinkin' 'bout me, thinkin' 'bout me
Dibby dibby dip, dum dum...
(Who were you thinkin' 'bout?)
(You weren't thinkin' 'bout me!)
Say who! Say who! Mmm yeah
Say who!
I'm sure not thinkin' bout you!

(Who were you thinkin' 'bout?)
(You weren't thinkin' 'bout me!)
