Get out of the cold
Get out of the rain
The story's been told
You'll be back again
Hey girl
You don't need to hide
The fear of a change
You don't have to lie
You will be back again

I'm a blind believer
But I can feel the light
That you're sending out
And you know that I'm right
You'll come back again
Someday you'll be back again

If you believe in what you are
You'll never be wrong and never too far
Many too many are not like you
But none of their dreams will come true

Hey girl
You'll turn to your path
And to redefine
The end of the line
You'll be back again
You might also likeI'm a blind believe...
