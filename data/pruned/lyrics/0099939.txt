I
Know sometimes I anger you
But even when I do
Don't you dare think about someone new
Cause problems, we were made to solve em
They can be resolved
So when we argue, girl I don't want you
To go anywhere at all
At all

[Hook 1]
Because, I'm only human
I'm only human
Human, human
I was not made to be
Superhuman
I'm only human

[Verse 2]
Though sometimes you get on my last nerve
I wouldn't go back to her
Or any other girl
And though, we only live life once
Girl you are all I want
In this, or any other world
And so
Even though we get mad
Think about what we have
Don't give it up
Next time
We get in each-other's face
I'll grab you by the waist
And say, "listen up"
You might also like[Hook 2]
Because, we're only human
We're only human
Human, human
We were not made to be
Superhumans
We're only human

[Rap Bridge]
I'm sorry that we couldn't be perfect in every way
But it'd be better if we take this at a steady pace
Instead of acting out of rage, and being upset for days
Why don't you stay? Let's talk it out, we'll be okay
Cause you're somebody that I just don't wanna be without
So don't you leave, cause Ima chase you till my knees give out
I know sometimes some words are spoken, and your heart starts feelin broken
But here's a good way of coping girl just scream and shout
Aye!
Just scream and shout
Oh!
Come on, just scream and shout
Aye!
Just let it out
Aye! Oh! Oh!
