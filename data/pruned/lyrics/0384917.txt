Growing up in a world thats so boring
Try'na get my mind right keep from hearing snoring
Doing what I need thats Salat in the morning
Praying 2 the Most High staying in His favors
All I need is blessings 2 keep my mind from stressing
I love my Family and Friends yes i'll do anything
I wanna keep em close cause without i'll be Nothing
I was Taught 2 be Respectful defend from my Attackers
I need People the most when these times gets so Hard
But I Stick 2 my circle cause i'm always on my Guard
I always stick 2 School cause I wanna be on Top
Plus my Momma seems 2 Like all these A's that I Drop

Verse 2:
When I need Guidance I stick 2 my Brother cause he's Deuce Six and i'm just the LiL' G
I look out the Window all I see is the Same Thing
Smoking on this Crack people Killing there Damn Brains
Sticking 2 the Qur'an I need some Ayahs 2 Recite
I need 2 Meditate my mind I need 2 get out of Sight
Coming Mome I guess I know somethings Wrong
I catch my Bro an he's sitting all Alone
Telling Me the World don't like US an they'll never Leave Us Alone
So I ask him What Do We Do
How do we Knock Em Off their thorn
And he says he heard Online we need 2 Give Ourselves 2 God
So Allahu Akbar I guess we Off 2 the SKYYou might also like
