Here I am awake and taking every chance I'm given
Feeling more and more alive with every note I'm singing

[Pre-Chorus]
I do all I do until I can't go on
I put all I do into the song

[Chorus]
So when the day comes and I don't wake up
I'll float away, full of love, like helium
From heaven I won't worry
'Cause I left behind one hell of a story
Float away, full of love, like helium
From heaven I won't worry
'Cause I left behind one hell of a story

[Verse 2]
When I walk I walk until my shoes are torn and tattered
For my love I'll fight until my body's bruised and battered
That's all that matters

[Pre-Chorus]
I do all I do until I can't go on
I put all I do into the song
You might also like[Chorus]
So when the day comes and I don't wake up
I'll float away, full of love, like helium
From heaven I won't worry
'Cause I left behind one hell of a story
Float away, full of love, like helium
From heaven I won't worry
'Cause I left behind one hell of a story

[Bridge]
Open your eyes and soak it up
This life ain't long enough
So love all that you can
I'm rising up, I'm rising up

[Chorus]
So when the day comes that I don't wake up
I'll float away, full of love, like helium
From heaven I won't worry
'Cause I left behind one hell of a story
Float away, full of love, like helium
From heaven I won't worry
'Cause I left behind one hell of a story
I left behind one hell of a story
I left behind one hell of a story
