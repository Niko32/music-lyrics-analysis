I'd love you 'till the time was forced to slow down
I'd make you understand love the right way
I'd give you all of me to make you so proud
I'm begging for a shot, that is all I can say
If you were mine, I'd never let you go
If you were mine, I'd hold you close to me
If you were mine, I'd treat you like you're everything I need
If you were mine, say if you
If you were mine, I'd teach you all the things you should know

[Hook]
If you were mine
If you were mine, ooh I
If you were, if you were mine
Oooh ooh oohYou might also like
