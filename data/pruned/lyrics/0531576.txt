[Verse 1: Bloody Jay]
We gotta get it by any means, which means
Leaving nothing in between
Communication makes a good team (it does)
Which leads to accomplishing dreams, VVS's, championship rings
I ain't bull shittin, I'm tryna spread this paper forreal
These niggas ain't showing love for real
Thats how niggas get killed
Keep it real with the real, fuck the fake
These niggas just tryna keep up with the drugs and count the money that you make
That ain't loyal neither, these niggas not really your peeps(they not)
Better watch your people, look out for your people
Who (?)

I miss my niggas (I do) I miss my niggas
NawFr NawFr NawFr
Thats why I'ma go hard to the fullest
I wish I was there so I could catch her bullets
Cuz I remember the time that you would tell me that you would die for me
I would look in your eyes and tell you that I would rather you ride for me
Still lie for me, Rep this five with me
Be all we can be
Us fuck them, remember that
Still us fuck them, I'ma always remember that

[Chorus]
