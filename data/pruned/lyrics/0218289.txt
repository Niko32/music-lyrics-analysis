I hang on everything that you say
You know I can see all the things that imply you secretly are in love
And finally, when I let myself fall hard for you
I see you trying to pretend like I'm making it up

[Pre-Chorus]
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like

[Chorus]
Bring it down, bring it on
Bring it now, bring it on
This is what it feels like now
It's getting old
Bring it down, bring it on

[Verse 2]
Remember the first time when we met?
You said that you couldn't sleep 'cause of me
Told me I'd caught you off guard
And then when you saw how I felt the same, you pulled away
Started acting like being with me was too hard

[Pre-Chorus]
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
This is what it feels like
You might also like[Chorus]
Bring it down, bring it on
Bring it now, bring it on
This is what it feels like now
It's getting old
Bring it down, bring it on

[Chorus]
Bring it down, bring it on
Bring it now, bring it on
This is what it feels like now
It's getting old
Bring it down, bring it on

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Bring it down, bring it on
Bring it now, bring it on
This is what it feels like now
It's getting old
Bring it down, bring it on

[Outro]
(Bring it down, bring it on)
(Bring it now, bring it on)
(This is what it feels like now)
(It's getting old)
(Bring it down, bring it on)
