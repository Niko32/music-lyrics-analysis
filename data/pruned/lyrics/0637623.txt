Razor sharp
Hop in the whip
And then i [?]
Crack the sunroof
Spark up a doob to clear my thoughts
Mind racin for the paper
Paper chasin's in my nature
Gonna get it while its good
As i should, no hesitation
They told me to remain patient
But the game waitin
Doubters wanna see me fail
But im gon make it
Hit me on the phone if money is the conversation
We all came to get paid
Whats the point of fakin
Took a hi-atus to perfect my preparations
No luck its all talent and raw determination
I often lie red eyed, like the terminators
Back on that darth vader supervillain flavor
Its the return of the real motherfuck them haters
Turn the table on these niggas motherfuck yo favors
Im in the crib smokin loud bout to wake the neighbors
Plottin on the come up its a must i get this paper
You might also like[Chorus: Trademark]
Say hello to the villain i been chillin' for a minute
But im back up in the buildin' with them verses worth a million
Lemme talk my shit spark this piff man i love the feelin'
God willin' im a minion soon or later better livin' [x2]

[Verse 2: Trademark]
Take a sample i came to get mine
I know in due time with dedication and grind combined
Ima get mo, ridin slow blowin smoke cruisin thru the n.o
Mixin cheef with the kush foggin up the windows
Mind on this dough its a must i get u already know
Better days ahead of me now im done with being broke
Stacked up some racks off this rap shit so i stay afloat
Keep my mind stuck on the grind no time for these hoes
Highs and lows are part of this game i handle it like a pro
Enjoy it while you got it my nigga everything come and goes
Lames get exposed thought they was real but now you know
They faker than them retros they slingin out the corner store
Everybody bout they dollars it ain't just pref low
Get yo hustle on while its good stretch that money long
Double up triple up nigga til you finally on...homie
Its the return

[Chorus: Trademark]
[Outro]
