Tell her I'm alright
Tell her that I'm on the mend
Tell her I've been born again
Tell her that the future's looking bright

Do this, won't you Jesus?
For I never meant to stray
Jesus, talk to Mama
Tell her that we'll meet again some day

Jesus, if you hear me
Take a message to my Ma
Tell her that I'm in your hands
Tell her I'm a different man
Tonight I beat the Devil to the draw

All I'm really asking is to tell her I found you
Jesus, talk to Mama
Tell her that my wandering days are through

Jesus, talk to Mama
Tell her I'm doing good
Tell her how I kicked the blues
Tell her how it's all good news
I'm living like she always wished I would
Tell her, won't you Jesus, that the wonders will never cease
Jesus talk to Mama, tell her so her soul can rest in peaceYou might also like
