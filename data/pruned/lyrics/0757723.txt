Is a fertile soul
Like dusky forest grow
On fallen leaves
We draw the essence of mortal weakness
Holyness - the worst gift of light
Is long dead and gone
Buried by our sisters ages ago

And not blood keeps us alive
Souls of infidel men flow through our veins
One last silent scream
One last breath
The moment we appear from the shadows
To inhale another soul
