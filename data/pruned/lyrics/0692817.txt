Halle, Hallelujah

[Verse]
You wonderin', how big a empire is he gon' make?
Just got off a major tour, bet everybody knows his name
Yeah that boy eatin' better, stackin' chips, that's Frito-Lay
You not with Reach no more, so 116 is he okay?
That's the question that they ask me
I shake they hand and smile and tell 'em, "Everything is dandy"
But deep inside I wish sometimes them conversations passed me
And debates about who better, you, Lecrae, or Andy?
Sign this deal, I bet that we can change your life today
I'm no little mermaid, I won't let you take my voice away
Derek Minor, I'm a Tesla, you can't gas me man
They promise you the world but don't deliver like it's Sunday
All that I know, all that I know
Not gainin' the world or losin' my soul, losin' my soul
When I wanna give up, He tellin' me go, tellin' me go
Buildin' His Kingdom will never get old, never get oldYou might also like
