Rocking after midnight
We'll be rocking after midnight

[Verse]
After midnight, girl
After midnight, baby
It's time to rock, ooh
Let me rock you, rock you
Rock you into midnight, baby
Let me rock you into love
I know you give me lots and lots of good loving baby
After midnight, baby
The time, the time is right for you and me tonight
But now we've got to dance
And soon after we make romance
You know I need your love
Worser than the stars above
Darling don't hesitate
After the date, oh, no, no, no-o-o
Sweetheart, you're so good to me
Your precious love, it can't be beat
Oh my sweet
(Yes I'm understood
Baby love me good)
I love the way you do your thing
I love all the joy you bring
I love your little coochie-coo
I love making love to you
Call out in the name of love
Call out in the name of tenderness
Call out in the name of sweet love
Call out in the name of love
Call out in the name of happiness
I love the way you walk baby
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
And I really love the way you talk girl
And I really love the way you move
Thrill me, thrill me, thrill me, girl
Groove me, groove me, groove me baby
I love those little pretty ways
Want to be in love with you
For the rest of my days
And I even love the funky little things you do
I'm in trouble baby
I love your mind and your body too
My heart is yours to keep baby
And your happiness is all I see
And your love will be my last
Oh, I say good-bye to the heartbreak past
Oh, yes, I'm understood
Oh, baby do me good

I love the way you do your thing, hey
I love all the joy you bring
I love all your pretty ways
I love you the rest of your days
I love the way you coochie-coo, and
I love making love to you
I love you baby
I love you baby
I love you baby
I love you baby

[Outro]
So tonight, when the night time comes
I'll be getting some, get it, get it
So tonight, when the night time comes
I'll be getting some
Having fun
