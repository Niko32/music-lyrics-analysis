I know that you know
That you'll never leave me

Ray Charles, Ray Bans
Working on my suntan
All summer long

Come on over after work
And I'll sing you a song

Mmmm, mmmmm

Picks me up in his car
Tells me I'm a superstar
Likes the way I play guitar

Puts his hand on my leg
I lean in and kiss his neck
Baby you the best

Cherry lip gloss on
Momma says he's all wrong
He's a rock and roll song

That's why I love him
Put no boy above him
He keeps it turned up

We've got that young summer love
We've got that young summer love
We've got that young summer love

And I remember we met in December
I was hung up on another man
But your bright blue eyes gave me butterflies
And baby you still can

I remember back then
Thinking "he's a perfect 10"
Ima let him take me out

Instead he cooked me dinner; what a little winner
Since then there's been no doubt

We'd have that young summer love
We've got that young summer love
We've got that young summer love
We've got that young summer love

Here's the thing
It was just a little fling
It started off with a kiss
Now he's calling me "baby"
Says I make him crazy
How did it end up like this?

July was so hot
Lying by the lilacs
"let me take you for a ride"
He said to me as he pulled in on his bike

And I swear I've never felt so alive
Than riding with him in the bright moonlight
Wind in my hair, you know i love Petty
With my feet on the dash of a souped up Chevy

We've got that young summer love
We've got that young summer love
We've got that young summer love
We've got that young summer love

That young summer love
Better than any drug
Like a bowl of strawberries
And napping on the rug

Better than Elvis on vinyl
Baby it's wild and it's primal
No, no there ain't no doubt
Come on over and kiss my mouth
No, no there ain't no doubt
Come on over, i need you now

I said, no, no there ain't no doubt
Come on over and kiss my mouth
No, no there ain't no doubt
Come on over I need you now
