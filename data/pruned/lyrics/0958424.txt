Just took the car and drove off in the night
I understand that frustrated feeling
But running out don't change and make it right
I woke up to an empty bed this morning
I had to call up Ruthy for a ride
You never called to take away my worries
Just left me with this cement ball inside

Now don't you think it's almost cruel, heartless and unfair
To say that you love me and then act like you don't care
I'm lost and lonely blue and sad, hungry for your kiss
Every time you leave like that, you leave me like this

Now I'm not saying that it's always your fault
'Cause that would be a long way from the truth
But every time we start to fight and argue
Don't forget that I'm in love with you
I'm asking you to think about your actions
'Cause consequences could be quite severe
The next time you come back to say I'm sorry
Honey you might be the only thing that's here

Now don't you think it's almost cruel, heartless and unfair
To say that you love me and then act like you don't care
I'm lost and lonely blue and sad, hungry for your kiss
Every time you leave like that, you leave me like this
Yeah every time you leave like that, you leave me like thisYou might also like
