I'm so sorry you had to kick my ass
You said I ruined your life
I didn't mean to do that
I had to untangle where we was entwined
You were strangling me
Were you breathing so fine

[Chorus]
The jam I was in when things weren't working out
Led me to the brunt of your swinging bout

[Verse 2]
I'm so sorry, I regret everything
But what can I do
To have you take back that swing
I'm so sorry a scuffle ensued
But things are much better now
I guess thanks to you

[Chorus]
The jam I was in when things weren't working out
Led me to the brunt of your swinging bout

[Verse 3]
I'm so sorry you had to pull my hair
I had to take care of business
A lot of business giving thereYou might also like
