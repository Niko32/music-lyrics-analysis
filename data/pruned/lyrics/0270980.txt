Grew up on these big streets
Circlin' around myself that's track meets
Almost a vegetarian  that's lean meats
Sittin' at tables making mean beats
Romans at war with ease
Hit em with the Trojan horse big tease
Smiling at myself I say cheese
I'm so photogenic
So clean is my hygienics
Punch lines that's clean hits
Like ice cream I hit licks
Coughin up lines I feel sick
I can't see I'm slick rick
I'm Ticked off like deer ticks
Hot Like Britney in '03
So old I got crows feet
So bold I feel free
So cold, ya feel me?
I'm gold so kill me
I'm sold so seal me
But behold: I'm straight
So deal me
On the track with CG
High jumpin I'm luigi
Toads are the only shrooms that I eat
I'm on my own like fiji
Britney is so chichi
So red I'm feelin peachy
Toxic: the figure of speech B

Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down
Too high, can't come down

[Verse 2: Childish Gambino]
Fandango my mandingo, we should do a movie
Groupies lookin' like the Yakuza in my Jacuzzi
Excuse me I'm on that ooey, my pockets are life with Louis
Euros is different colors, my wallet look like a Coogi
He who speakin' the least is Chief Keefin' the peace
Leavin' seeds in yo niece, prayin' that she ain't late
Sprayin' like that AK, now that shit my namesake
'Bino you so nasty, ass like an ashtray
Smokin' Flying Lotus, used to be Jehovah's
I'm in yo girl and now she feeling Polish like pierogies
They hopin' that they smoke us
N'aw man, never that
Trippin' off that earwax, Danny Brown and D-Stacks
Ill pandemic, man that shit be everywhere
Midas is your highness and you Haribo like Gummi bears
Why I'm fly like a cockpit, you don't fly like a ostrich
Stupid shit like a mosh pit, can't believe this is "Toxic"

[Hook x2]
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
It's in the air and it's all around
Too high, can't come down
