Whoa, alright!

[Verse 1]
Thunder, rain and lightnin'
Danger, water risin'
Clamor, sirens wailing
It's such a bad sign
Shadows of dark creatures
Steel clouds floatin' in the air
People run for shelter
What's gonna happen to us?

[Pre-Chorus]
All the steps we take, all the moves we make
All the pain at stake
I see the chaos for everyone
Who are we? What can we do?
You and I are the same in the way that
We have our own styles that we won't change
Yours is filled with evil, and mine is not
There is no way I can lose

[Chorus]
Can't hold on much longer
(But I will never let go)
I know it's a one-way track
(Tell me now how long this'll last)
I'm not gonna think this way
(Nor will I count on others)
Close my eyes and feel it burn
(Now I see what I've gotta do)

[Verse 2]
Ancient cities blazin'
Shadows keep attackin'
Little children cryin'
Confusion, hopeless anger

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know what it can be
But you drive me crazy
All your cunning tricks make me sick
You won't have it your own way

[Chorus]
Can't hold on much longer
(But I will never let go)
I know it's a one-way track
(Tell me now how long this'll last)
I'm not gonna think this way
(Nor will I count on others)
Close my eyes and feel it burn
(Now I see what I've gotta do)

Open your heart, and you will see!
[Guitar Solo]

All right!
Yeah

[Bridge]
If it won't stop
There will be no future for us
Its heart's tied down by
All the hate; gotta set it free

[Chorus Variation]
I know it's a one-way track
(Tell me now how long this'll last)
Close my eyes and feel it burn
(Now I see what I've gotta do)

Gotta open your heart, dude!

[Chorus]
Can't hold on much longer
(But I will never let go)
I know it's a one-way track
(Tell me now how long this'll last)
I'm not gonna think this way
(Nor will I count on others)
Close my eyes and feel it burn
(Now I see what I've gotta do)
Open your heart, it's gonna be alright!

[Outro]
Yeah!
Open your heart!
Yeah!
Open your heart!
