And your fingers taste of really strong spice
Early morning when the sky is black
All my kisses hit you right between the eyes

I'm going out of here for the last time
I'm going out of here for the last time

Did you know that I won't be back
When you wake up you probably realized
Did you know that I won't be back
I'll escape your whispers, your true lies

I'm going out of here for the last time
I'm going out of here for the last time

Do you feel the loneliness? It moves away now, it moves away now
Do you feel the loneliness? It's here to stay now, it's here to stay...

I'm going out of here for the last time
I'm going out of here for the last timeYou might also like
