Of poetry and poses
And each man knows hell be alone
When the sacred ginmill closes

And so well drink the final glass
Each to his joy and sorrow
And hope the numbing drink will last
Til opening tomorrow

And when we stumble back again
Like paralytic dancers
Each knows the question he must ask
And each man knows the answer

And so well drink the final drink

That cuts the brain in sections
Where answers do not signify
And there aren't any questions

I broke my heart the other day
It will mend again tomorrow
If Id been drunk when I was born
Id be ignorant of sorrow
You might also likeAnd so well drink the final toast
That never can be spoken:
Here's to the heart that is wise enough
To know when its better off broken
