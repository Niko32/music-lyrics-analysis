[Verse 1: Just Ice]
Now the way I project my articulate vernacular
Should always make you suspect
I'm concentrating my thoughts on higher goals
If you think about opposing me I know that you're bold
In addition I mention the reason my tension, my rhymes I be facing
To take out every bit of competition
So please adhere, I swear my voice is near and clear
All puppy punks you'd better be aware
My speech is unique, never obsolete
With mathematical terms to make it complete
Elevated to a level that's kind of far
Comprehended by the wise Gomar Oz Dubar
Positive electrons activate
Constructive energy that does create
A dynamic flow that's hard and swift
Allowing me to get loose so y'all can bear witness
Presenting my wisdom in a different form
Speakers flip high science making knowledge born
When I approach my adversary, I'm coming strong
From knowledge to cipher then releasing my bomb
I'm life not living, cos living's not life
Manifesting 120, and do it precise
Do it nice and slow with a real smooth flow
Swift and changeable but continues to grow
Concentrating and dwelling on real high science
I keep to myself, I'm very self-reliant
Don't bother me rappers cause I heard your words
Not saying it twice because you're getting on my nerves
Rhymes that's solid, a voice like a rock
Give you instant eye jammys, as well as beat knots
If you ain't had enough stick around for a while
Peep it out everybody my kool and deadly style
Hurr-rah
You might also likeAh yeah, I'm really having fun now
Cold getting dumb

[Verse 2: Just Ice]
Controlling and strolling, my mind will be probing
Complex intellects cos like a rock I'm rolling
Never say hello, enchanting like a cello
Burn you like fire step back of my track, my mellow
You know I'm scheming now it will be seeming
First you played basketball now you're day dreaming
What does it take to correct a mistake
Point blank you can't rhyme yo those are the breaks
But if you want to hear a fresh rhyme peep out my lines
Not biting no lyrics cos it is a crime
You know it is with unbelievable measures
How far will you go before correcting your errors?
Mind is in a twirl, so what you got a girl?
We'd be all messed up if you ruled the world
Sweep up the dirt, concentrate on my work
My gangster style rap will hurt, jerk
Break with flamboyancy, please stop annoying me
Selling the elite top choice extraordinary
A major shock when proceeded to rock
Then I went like an alarm, and start to clock
With a push and a pull, a bump and then a shove
Very kool and deadly and ready to bug out
On anyone that tries to diss
My style, my record, or my name Justice
Just Universal Self Truth I Concentrated Energy
Never trade on lies
Gonna reach for my goal whether lower or higher
You can't rap you lollipop liar!
