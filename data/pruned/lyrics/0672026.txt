Woke up its a beautiful day
Can't trip got a clip & a lighter on my tray
So I'm wakin’ & bakin’, raisin’ & blazin’
Awoken I'm smokin’, I'm up so I'm tokin’
Medical for my mental health
Just got a new text let me check my cell
Got a message from my dog & a couple of my women
My dog said its money so I gotta go get it
No rest for the righteous
Show love even if they don't like us
But it's funny 'cause they girl wanna ride us
Usually I would chill but yo today yo I might just
Go in like a G’s supposed to
Make fly jams for my peeps to smoke to
Everyday life that's the shit we go through
Yo I feel good & my nigga you should too

[HOOK: STEFisDOPE]
Yo I feel good ayo you feel good
Stepped out mad fly looking real good
Yo I feel good Ayo you feel good
Got my papers & my trees yo I'm real good
Yo I feel good ayo you feel good
Baby girl hella cute bet it's real good
Yo I feel good ayo you feel good
You alive just chill 'cause it's still good

In the crib gettin’ high with my niggas
Thinking of a plan how to get some more figures
I'm meditating on the ‘91 NSX
Matte black on black gotta get it yes
I got a eye for the finer things
Think big I don't dwell upon the minor things
I gotta get it by any means necessary
Smoke loud buy any greens necessary
They love me out in D.C. like Marion Barry
No politician I'm a young revolutionary
Life's good but I wanna make it better
A lot more love & a little more cheddar
Got a true squad that be down for whatever
Smooth like silk but I'm tough like leather
Birds of a feather, so we fly together
Live life get dough & spread love forever

[HOOK: STEFisDOPE]
Yo I feel good ayo you feel good
Stepped out mad fly looking real good
Yo I feel good Ayo you feel good
Got my papers & my trees yo I'm real good
Yo I feel good ayo you feel good
Baby girl hella cute bet it's real good
Yo I feel good ayo you feel good
You alive just chill 'cause it's still good
