Blow up world in minor key
Step out wide, I think I'll back her
Reckon she'll get there ahead of me

Jittery aim and all
It's better to push and stagger than break
Bend out flat in face of aggression
See what you can take

Hey! Take that river back!
Put it on the shelf!

Sometimes I think we could fly the whole affair by FX
Moon, wings, the usual

Bird with red eyes bends a long neck
Stabs down, colours itself
We don't see it
It breaks the world somewhere else

You know you can replace this idea
Replace it on the shelf
Sometimes it's a bird in a cage
Sometimes the cage itself
You might also likeYou could throw the book in the air
See where it lands
That's the page you can read
That's the one that binds the plot where she fell

And wept
Look real crocodiles
Crawl'd 'twixt cheek and chin
She said take your sword, young Andrew and
Plunge it in

I had the push, I had the stagger
I had the pack in front of me
It was dangerous, wild, it was landslide and cracked air
You know the world's a big place to see

It looks like a journey
The view's exquisite
Nakedness, way stations and lakes
It's like something from Shakespeare
It's something for nothing
See what you can take
