Oh, darling
That's not the way it was planned
I know I kept you waiting
I screwed up my timing again
You told me the fears that were in your head
Sitting there cross-legged on my bed
"Don't you stay away long," that's what you said

[Verse 2]
So quickly
Summer ran right into spring
I see your face lying next to me
Just on the edge of my dreams
So tired I can't explain
I lost something precious that was in my hand
I let it all slip away slow like grains of sand

[Chorus]
If you're through with me, I guess I'll see
When I'm standing at your door
I finally got my balance back
To where I was before
And I've never been so lonely
So I'm singing a Skydiggers' song
As I'm eating Arizona dust
And wishing I was home
You might also like[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's too hard to look back
When you don't like what you see
Pictures of all the people I love
I let them down so casually
And you told me all the fears that were in your head
Sitting there cross-legged on my bed
"Don't you stay away long," that's what you said

[Chorus]
If you're through with me, I guess I'll see
When I'm standing at your door
I finally got my balance back
To where I was before
And I've never been so lonely
So I'm singing a Skydiggers' song
As I'm eating Arizona dust
And wishing I was home

[Outro]
As I'm eating Arizona dust
And wishing I was home
As I'm eating Arizona dust
And wishing I was home
