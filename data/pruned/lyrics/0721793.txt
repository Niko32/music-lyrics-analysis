While you get me in the mood
Told me you want to play
Looks like I'm ready for my point of view

Look how my love be wigglin' (wigglin')
Look how my love be tingling (Tingling)
Look your love be rendering me helpless
I'm so helpless
Your love has got me (Oh!)

Here let me light some candles
While you tell me 'bout your day
I sigh cause my girl is so classy (hey)
In bed she only cares about one thing (one thing)

My freak
My nighttime rider
The sheets just where I like her
Her passion brings out my fire
No I can't describe her

I can't describe her
I can't describe her
I can't describe her
I can't describe her
I can't describe her
I can't describe her
You might also likeWon't you come here with your candy
Cause I want to make it creamy
I like when her buttercup
Jumps on my lumpy lumps
How kind of you to always want to get me off
You always know just what I want

The sheets just where I like her
Her passion brings out my fire
No I can't describe her
