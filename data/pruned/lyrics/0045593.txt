I used to walk around like
Nothing could happen to me
Life is a gamble so I
Should live life more carefully
But all I know is that I
Control my own destiny
I used to look at others
Instead of me blaming me

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
Don't ask yourself why
Just look to the sky
Believe that soon you'll see the other side cause

[Hook]
I know
That through all the struggle
There's a bright road
At the end of the tunnel
Now you should know
Whatever your dilemma may be
You'll learn
Life is worth it
Watch the tables turn

[Verse 2: T-Boz]
Whenever you feel troubled
With problems coming your way
Don't ever get discouraged
There's always... a better day
We all don't know the answers
Believe and trust when I say
That havin' faith is always
The way to make things okay

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli]
Don't ask yourself why
Just look to the sky
Believe that soon you'll see the other side

[Hook]
I know
That through all the struggle
There's a bright road

You'll learn (You will learn)
Life is worth it
Watch the tables turn
