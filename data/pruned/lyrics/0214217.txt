Thought I heard voices
Reflected voices
Satellite message

Isn't it something?
The realizing
Silver dots marking
Endless horizon

Over the ocean
We'll have a vodka
Your card is left open
So nothing can stop ya

So far, so good
So far, so good...
So far, so good...
So far, so good...
So far, so good...
So far, so good...
So far...

I am not worried
Some have a fear
The captain has comfort
His voice in my ear
What are we doing?
When we are standing?
Your life may be bumpy
More so than the landing
You might also likeOver the ocean
Over the ocean
Over the ocean
Over the ocean
