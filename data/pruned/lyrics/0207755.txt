Now the tale sits on lead of the 6 o'clock indoctrination
In a daze he tries to make sense of it all
So he takes a drive to try to clear his weary mind

The city lights fading from the rear view mirror
One headlight stabs the looming black
Up ahead is a road that's not been traveled
Is there any turning back?

Day breaks,  panic over takes him
In a sweat, he looks around, all these eyes, how much do they know?
Lying low waiting for the cover of the moonless night
He makes his move, he's got to get away, far away
The city lights fading from the rear view mirror
One headlight stabs the looming black
Up ahead is a road he's never traveled
And he knows, there's no turning back?

Who told the lies, wrapped in shards of the truth
Fabricated, but for what means or reasons
In a land of “Guilty by Dissemination”
What could he say to make anyone believe him
Now he's damned – to live a life on the runYou might also like
