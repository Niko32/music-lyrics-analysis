Destruction is my state of mind
Armageddon It'll come in time
When my whole world is gonna explode
My machine gun is gonna unload

Like an animal I take my prey
Where I exist I'm [?]
I take no prisoners when I'm on point
Grab a chair let's wreck this joint!

[Chorus]
You see you don't understand
Where I am or where I've been or where I'm going
You don't understand
Where I am or where I've been or where I'm

[Verse 2, Tim]
Have you ever seen the devil?
Well I have and now he's in trouble
Our liberty and freedom I abet
Our words I will never regret

So I ain't ever gonna follow
Or beg or steal or borrow
See steady is the hand I hold
I won't do what I am told
You might also like[Chorus]
You see you don't understand
Where I am or where I've been or where I'm going
You don't understand
Where I am or where I've been or where I'm

[Verse 3, Lars]
Retaliation is my crime
Communication, a waste of time
Inebriation suits me fine
Incarcerate my own mind

When it all's just cost and concern
Knowing me you know I'm never gonna learn
Get in line 'cause it's your turn
Play with fire and you're gonna get burned

[Chorus]
You see you don't understand
Where I am or where I've been or where I'm going
You don't understand
Where I am or where I've been or where I'm going
