Why don't you call me?
Do you think I won't answer?
Jupiter's risin'
And the moon is in cancer
You been down in the hunger, baby
I been around there too
Tonight you could be in the arms of
The arms of a woman who loves you

[Verse]
You got your questions
Maybe I got an answer
Or just the hands of a healer
And the feet of a dancer
Yeah it's all in the wrists now, baby
And when the aim is true
There'll be no blink of the eyes, baby
The eyes of this woman who loves you
(Eyes of a woman who loves you)

[Bridge]
Heaven's gettin' nearer
Transmission gettin' clearer now, my love
Stars are fallin' over the ocean
Come on and show a little emotion now, my love
You might also like[Verse]
Why don't you call me?
You know I'm gonna answer
Temperatures risin'
And the moon is in cancer
There's a road you can ride now, baby
Out to that wild and blue
It runs right through the heart of
The heart of this woman who loves you
Yea, right through the heart of
The heart of this woman who loves you
(Heart of a woman who loves you)

[Outro]
Jupiter risin'
Jupiter risin'
Jupiter risin'
