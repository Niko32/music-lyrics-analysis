Drivin' in a Pontiac
Just about to lose my mind
I was goin' to Arizona
Maybe on to California
Where the people all live so fine
My baby said I's crazy
My mama called me lazy
I was gonna show them all this time
'Cause you know I ain't no fool and
I don't need on more schoolin'
I was born to just to walk the line

Livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Well you know I've been through it
When I set my watch back to it
I'm livin' on Tulsa time

Well there I was in Hollywood
Wishin' I was doin' good
Talkin' on the telephone line
But they don't need me in the movies
And nobody sings my songs
Guess I'm just a-wastin' time
But then I got to thinkin'
Man I'm really sinkin'
And I really had a flash this time
I had no business leavin'
And nobody would be grievin'
If I went on back to Tulsa time
You might also likeLivin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Well you know I've been through it
When I set my watch back to it
I'm livin' on Tulsa time

Oh, I'm livin' on Tulsa time
Livin' on Tulsa time
Well you know that I've been through it
When I set my watch back to it
I'm livin' on Tulsa time
