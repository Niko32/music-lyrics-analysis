Mama's gonna buy you a mocking bird
If that mocking bird won't sing
Mama's gonna buy you a diamong ring
If that diamond ring turns brass
Mama's gonna buy you a looking glass
If that looking glass gets broke
Mama's gonna buy you a billy goat
If that billy goat won't pull
Mama's gonna buy you a cart and bull
If that cart and bull turn over
Mama's gonna buy you a dog named Rover
If that dog named Rover won't bark
Mama's gonna buy you a horse and cart
If that horse and cart break down
You'll still be the sweetest little baby in townYou might also like
