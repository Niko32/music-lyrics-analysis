Gather 'round me buddies
Hold your glasses high
And drink to a fool a crazy fool who told his baby goodbye
Too late he's found he loves her so much he wants to die
So drink to a fool a crazy fool who told his baby goodbye
He needs her he needs her so
He wonders why he let her go
She's found a new love buddy
He's a lucky guy
So drink to a fool cause I'm that fool who told his baby goodbyeYou might also like
