You and I would be just fine
If I was the one
To stay the day and waste away
But I tend to run

[Chorus]
I'm too good at leaving love
I'm too good at leaving love
I don't wanna be
I'm too good at leaving love
I'm too good at leaving love
I don't wanna be

[Verse 2]
It ain't fair, I don't care
Don't know what to say
Same old song, life goes on
I wish I could change

[Chorus]
I'm too good at leaving love
I'm too good at leaving love
I don't wanna be
I'm too good at leaving love
I'm too good at leaving love
I don't wanna be

Walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away
Walk away, walk away

[Chorus]
I'm too good at leaving love
I'm too good at leaving love
I don't wanna be (Walk away, walk away)
I'm too good at leaving love
I'm too good at leaving love
I don't wanna be (Walk away, walk away)
I'm too good at leaving love
I'm too good at leaving love
I don't wanna be (Walk away, walk away)
I'm too good at leaving love
I'm too good at leaving love
I don't wanna be
