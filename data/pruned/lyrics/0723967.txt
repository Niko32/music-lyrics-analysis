You opened up the scars again
Consume me like a cancer
Bringing on my wicked might
Distorting all the answers
Why?

[Verse 1]
The more I try to walk away
The more you flaunt it in my face
Enticing me with all that I hate

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stop the pain
And I'm suffering
I want you erased
I've had enough

[Chorus]
Run and escape from the chains that weigh me down
I can't replace this addiction in my head
Run, run, run and escape!
Run. run, I can't escape!

[Verse 2]
Fear and shame descend on me
Close my mind and let it be
Enslaving me and sealing my fate
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I can't stop the pain
And I'm suffering
I want you erased
I've had enough

[Chorus]
Run and escape from the chains that weigh me down
I can't replace this addiction in my head
Run, run, run and escape!
Run. run, I can't escape!

[Bridge]
Escape, I cannot, I cannot escape! I cannot escape! (Ru-u-u-u-u-u-u-n!)
(Help me!) Run, run and escape!
Escape from all the lies
From the fire that burns inside and keeps blinding my eyes
I am drawing the line I won't let you take my life, I'm through with all your poison
I need this to die!
I need this to die!
(I want to breathe!)

[Outro]
Run, run, run and escape!
Run, run, run
Help me escape!
Help me escape!
Help me escape!
Help me, help me escape!
