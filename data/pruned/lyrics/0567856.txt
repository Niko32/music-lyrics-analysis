And I been thinking this view, is everything that I need
So whatcha in the mood for? Whatcha in the mood for?

Hop in it's packed sit in my lap we're making
Quick pit stops getting it stocked up
Like I needed the steam's leaving my hand
Theme's keeping us close to summer sand
Lost in these rituals thoughts turn to visuals
Flattered by the gabbin' happening it tends to happen as the
Doors open leave it on the speaker even louder thats the needed feature
Chosen to go in the ocean test the water
Frozen for a moment though I hope you didn't notice
Yeah i got her, yeah i got her
Saltwater taste and that body by the waist
Bring that I'll zip my lips and listen whatcha wanna say?
Keep it fresh no pressure to impress
Less is more so lets keep it a guess with the words
For now chest deep, inside to the left you can check
You being you has that effect

Not thinkin' it through, that's the way that I be
And I been thinking this view, is everything that I need
So whatcha in the mood for? Whatcha in the mood for?

Driving 95 to nowhere, it'd be good to go there
No speedometer Im in the mood to move at my own pace
Leave behind thoughts in the rearview
Mind stays swinging towards taste from a grapevine
Hey it's time, jumping over the fences built
Erase the borders you've been building up the walls you hit
Time is gonna keep pushing so I'ma keep it moving
Now know down the street or at the beach could change the way you see it all
There's a lot of things I try to see so I keep my eyes open to evolve
Uniquely seek a view with peripherals involved
Liftin' looking to shift it
Setting my boat adrift, close or distant, keep it different
You might also likeDose of my mind, close my eyes, I'm running through ya
Change the way I fade away
Never get stuck in that shade I lay
Bed unmade elevate to places to stay

Not thinkin' it through, that's the way that I be
And I been thinking this view, is everything that I need
So whatcha in the mood for? Whatcha in the mood for?
