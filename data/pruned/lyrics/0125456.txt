What is that (pain nigga.)
(I've become) so succumb to numb (I don't feel nigga.)
Backstabbing, Judas actions, past actions, (I Don't fathom.)
Devil asking session for devil actions (so unpleasant.)
Baltimore, what I'm reppin
Manifested my essence
Gone with the Sin
Dark Presence true blessing
Since adolescence
Gone with the Vin
Feel within my tolerance thin 
And to begin
Pleasure Chasin only infringe
That nerving ending pain within
Just go ghost, let the pleasure free
Kill enemies
Balance get toast, now pain fleas
Kill enemies
Eyes simply in Frenzy, pure envy, for he who free
From empty, no sympathy
Nigga, That's a Kill enemy
Watch him bleed, not breathe
No empathy for he
All jealousy, just ease
Pure Treachery for me
The delinquency trapped in my fucking inner me
Finds Exctasy, when my enemies D I E

This life in the slums, Made me so numb
I feel far from being numb, when I makem numb
Nigga, I'm God Fucked
Nigga, Im satan Blessed
Prepare for your motherfuckin death

Such a real desire to feel, numbness doesn't appeal
Since I can't feel, I'll make em feel the way I feel
And that's nothing. Stick clubbing, Blood gushing, which I am loving
Im Slowly becoming, so unbecoming, their hearts I'm crushing

Body lying, in silence, loud sirens ,fam Crying, soul rising, to Zion
The iron, my devious python, Allah Typhon, and Almighty Orion
Let bygone be bygone, if long gone from life's bond, Dear Satan, another one home
