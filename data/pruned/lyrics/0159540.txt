She ain't scared to Go
She ain't scared to Go
She ain't scared to Go

[Verse 1]
She just moved to Atlanta, stayed in Alabama
Graduated high school, now she living life on the go, go, go
With nowhere to go, go, go, go
So I pick her up when she come in town
I reach for her hand, but she shut it down
I didn't know (know, know), that her heart was so cold (cold, cold, cold)

[Hook]
I'm just a youngin' and I'm begging I'm running all of your love
Don't end it cause baby I need you remember my touch
If there's problems let's share 'em I swear I'm not trying to lust
All I see is your silhouette when I look into the dusk

[Hook]
She ain't scared to Go
She ain't scared to Go
She ain't scared to Go
She ain't scared to Go

Light it up, pass it up and she good to go
Way she working and she twerking making magic on that pole
And I try to know her better, say they call her Tropicana
I say girl I got the juice baby let me make you wetter
Sweat be dripping down your spine, like you in a sweater
If I touch you wrong then touch me right, show me you do it better
If I had to choose it's you I been on Patron and juice
It's been known to get me loose, I can't wait to get in you

[Hook]
I'm just a youngin' and I'm begging I'm running all of your love
Don't end it cause baby I need you remember my touch
If there's problems we share 'em I swear I'm not trying to lust
All I see is your silhouette when I look into the dust

[Hook]
She ain't scared to Go
She ain't scared to Go
She ain't scared to Go

[Bridge]
Why would she leave me, she release your mind
She made me believe she was mine
And I wasted my time, cause she was trained to go
She was like the rest, man I should've known
I've been thinking about you I can't get you out my mind
I've been thinking about you I can't get you out my mind
I've been thinking about you I can't get you out my mind
I've been thinking about you I can't get you out my mind
[Hook]
I'm just a young and I'm begging I'm running all of your love
Don't end it cause baby I need you remember my touch
If there's problems we share 'em I swear I'm not trying to lust
All I see is your silhouette when I look into the dust

[Hook]
She ain't scared to Go
She ain't scared to Go
She ain't scared to Go
