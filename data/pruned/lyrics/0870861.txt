Faster on the lane
There's a crisis up ahead
Slow it down again
There's a crisis up ahead
Slow it down again
Youre in the best of hands
Or so you'd like to think
My turning's up ahead
And you dont even blink
My turning's up ahead
And you dont even blink
I live for speed
Hit the hidden heights
Dial the secret code
There's a crisis up ahead
But you dont even blink
There's a crisis up ahead
But you dont even blink
I live for speed
You stay unaware without a care
There's no response thats long gone
You crave rapid lights, acid nights
There's no respect thats long dead
Its long long deadYou might also like
