Excuse my motherfuckin' liquor
(Excuse my liquor)
Y'all know what time it is
I got some motherfuckin' west coast Fly'n'B team with me
Starr

And right now I'm with the motherfuckin' CEO
And what we've got for y'all is a nice presentation, Starr album
(Excuse my liquor)
I don't motherfuckin' oversee it
I don't motherfuckin' oversee it, I don't oversee this shit right here
This excuse my liquor [?]
