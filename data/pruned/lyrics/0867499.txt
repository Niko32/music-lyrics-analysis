All day, all night, started fucking haunting me
Just like the moon twisting, turning, shaping me
I saw the light and it started changing me

I saw the glow, chased that hollow victory
I lost it all with a change of scenery
I spoke the truth but you couldn’t handle it
I saw the light and I fucking ran from it

We made it here with belief and bravery
Courage it came when you tried to silence me
You don’t see me, am I fucking invisible?
You don’t see me, am I fucking invisible?

We made it here with belief and bravery
Courage it came when you tried to silence me
You don’t see me, am I fucking invisible?
You don’t see me, am I fucking invisible?

I saw the light, woah that shit was calling me
All day, all night, started fucking haunting me
Just like the moon twisting, turning, shaping me
I saw the light and it started changing me

I saw the glow, chased that hollow victory
I lost it all with a change of scenery
I spoke the truth but you couldn’t handle it
I saw the light and I fucking ran from it
