Pulled my foot from my mouth, answer back the things i've said
Wander through the valley of the shadow of the dead
Stumbled on this old sun dial, then these words I read
I only count the sunny hours, brightest hours of day
I never count the gloomy hours I let them slip away. And I realize I'm away

(Chorus)
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
I'm alright ya'll
Alright ya'll
Ya wanna be alright you gotta walk tall
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah
I'm alright ya'll
Alright ya'll
Ya wanna be alright you gotta walk tall

Well I woke up in to many beds with girls I didn't know
I seen lots of brothers at top and I watched them come & go
Tell me why I'm not dead with them in the valley down below
I give thanks everyday for these words they save my soul
I only count the sunny hours, brightest hours of day
I never count the gloomy hours I let them slip away. And I realize I'm away

(Chorus)
It's like the wise man said relax yourself
When it's movin too fast set it down
When the goin gets tough it gets you goin
If ya really wanna speak then make a sound
Keep your eyes on the prize and realize
That the trouble's gonna come in all shapes and sizes
Well ya gotta stay strong don't let your knees buckle
Ya gotta keep hustlin, keep hustlin, movin, groovin
