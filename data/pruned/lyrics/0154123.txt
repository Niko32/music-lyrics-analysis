I'm gonna bring you up x24
I'm gonna bring you up, time to bring you up x5
I, I, oh I x7
I'm gonna bring you up (I) x7

[Verse 1]
Well you say truth, is your desire
Well here's the fuel for your fire
So light it up, and dance with me
The time has come yo, in heaven's name
Well I know you feel it, but you won't say

Never goin back, I expect they want you to do good
You're comparing up with the Jones', ain't no sharing
