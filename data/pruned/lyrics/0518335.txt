Where's the love connection
Are we being tested
Baby who you texting when I'm not around
You used to come for seconds
Now you always stressing
Never send a message when I'm outta town
How could Trade me
Thought I was ya baby
Now you acting crazy
I can't even begin thinking bout all days when
When you used
(Chase me)
Phone me on a
(Daily)
Got nothing to say I'm biting my tongue

HOOK:
Girl whenever I see your face
(I got no words for ya)
And my vocabulary jumps right out my brain
(I got no words for ya babe)
I got no words for ya (No oh oh oh)
I got no words for ya (No oh oh oh)

Just touched down and I miss you bad
Caught you creeping with another man
You knew I was coming back
Why you Tryna make me mad
Funny how as I left your ass
I thought about what I could have said
Fuck that now I'm coming back
Now I'm looking in your eyes and I'm at a loss for words
But I ain't trippin
I'm just dippin, on my way out
And I got nothing to say to you babe
(I can't say nothing, I can't say nothing)

HOOK:
Girl whenever I see your face
(I got no words for ya)
And my vocabulary jumps right out my brain
(I got no words for ya babe)
I got no words for ya (No oh oh oh)

Verse 3:

I got no words for ya
What nerve on ya
Tryna tell me just what's in store
But I would never let myself go
Got full control
Just so you know
Look at yourself in the mirror
You silent but yo soul is screaming
Empty dictionaries for you
Not even a sound for the speaking
Trying to find myself is like chasing a shadow
At war wit myself it's a battle
How could ever fall for you I knew you bad but somehow I thought make that all change
HOOK:
Girl whenever I see your face
(I got no words for ya)
And my vocabulary jumps right out my brain
(I got no words for ya babe)
I got no words for ya (No oh oh oh)
I got no words for ya (No oh oh oh)
