Tell me all about how things will never go too far
Situation normal you're still living in the dark
You don't seem to care that I don't have that much to say
Gives you more time to blather on about your boring fucking day

[Chorus]
Oh my I don't know why I really hope you go and die
So I can live here without you and keep July

[Verse 2]
Wonder what you're telling her when I am miles away
Maybe that I'm screwing someone or I am turning gay
If you said something honest it would have to be a fluke
As all the rest of your bullshit dribbles out of you like puke

[Chorus]
Oh my I don't know why I really hope you go and die
So I can live here without you and keep July

[Verse 3]
Anyone that falls for you is one less pain for me
Cause that just means they're way too stupid to see you like I see
Treat your friends like crap but still you think my words are crass
If you open your mouth again I'll kick your fucking ass
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh my I don't know why I really hope you go and die
So I can live here without you and keep July
Oh my I don't know why I really hope you go and die
So I can live here without you and keep July
