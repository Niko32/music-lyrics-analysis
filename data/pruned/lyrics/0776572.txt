Just how much that you mean to me?
I'm sorry I took you forgranted
But without you I know how I'd be...

Imagine a day without sunshine
Or a mountain not having a view
And picture the Heavens not holding the stars
That's what I'd be like without you

It scares me to think I could lose you
By leaving you here all alone
But if you ever fall out of love here
I know how I'd be on my own...

Imagine a day without sunshine
Or a mountain not having a view
And picture the Heavens not holding the stars
That's what I'd be like without you
That's what I'd be like without youYou might also like
