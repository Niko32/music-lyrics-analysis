What can a man do
When the blues keep following him around
What can a poor man do
When the blues keep following him around
Get him a half pint of good liquor
And sit down and drink 'em on down
Look out!

[Verse 2]
The way I feel sometimes
I feel like drinking me some gasoline
I'm tellin' you, the way I feel sometimes
I feel like, I feel just like drinking me some gasoline
Striking me a match
And blow my, blow my blue self up in steam

Hey
Play the blues, play the blues, play the blues
Alright
Alright

[Verse 3]
I think I'll move back down south
Where the water tastes just like cherry wine
I think I'll move back down south
People, where the water tastes to me like cherry wine
'Cause this Lake Michigan water
Tastes to me just like turpentine
