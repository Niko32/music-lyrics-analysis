Lying face down, lying face down
In the gutter now, so damn proud
Well I know, I know, I know
It's my fault, it's my fault

Lying face down, lying face down
In the gutter now, so damn proud
Well I know, I know, I know
It's my fault, it's my fault

[Pre-Chorus]
In a world where we all just waste away
In a place you cry for today
(We're all going mad)

[Chorus]
Believe, believe, believe in me
I will follow
Believe, believe, believe in me
I will follow

[Verse 2]
Lying face down, lying face down
In the underground, so damn proud
Well I know, I know, I know
It's my fault, it's my fault
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
In a world where we all just waste away
In a place you cry for today
(We're all being brainwashed)

[Chorus]
Believe, believe, believe in me
I will follow
Believe, believe, believe in me
I will follow
Believe, believe, believe in me
I will follow
Believe, believe, believe in me
I will follow

[Bridge]
Love silence and fade away
(Darkness, darkness and decay)
A scarlet kiss and what to say
(Darkness, darkness and decay)
Love silence and fade away
(Darkness, darkness and decay)
A scarlet kiss and what to say
(Darkness, darkness and decay)

Believe, believe, believe in me...
Believe, believe, believe in me...
[Chorus]
Believe, believe, believe in me
I will follow
Believe, believe, believe in me
I will follow
Believe, believe, believe in me
I will follow
Believe, believe, believe in me
