WHAT THE FUCK WE WAITIN' FOR, BOY FROOT WORLD TOUR
GET MY ASS ON STAGE AND I PULL OUT MY KATANA SWORD
GO INTO A RAGE, CUT UP DOLCI AND GABBANA SCARVES
SMOKE A LITTLE SAGE, AND I SNORT A COUPLE XANAX BARS
SPIT A LINE OR TWO AND I WARN EM BOUT THE FROOT
IF HE COME UP TO YOU, BETTER RUN AND HIDE TOO
ANYTHING YOU FUCKING DO, NOT ENOUGH HE ON THE MOVE
AND THE STUFF YOU THOUGHT WAS TRUE NO LONGER APPLIES TO YOU
LET'S COOK SOME METH, MR. BLUE, HEISENBERG ON THE MOVE
ON THE CURB THAT I SWERVE, THEN I COME UP TO YOU
DRIVEBY ON YO ASS AND I PICK UP ALL YOUR CASH
GTA STYLE AND THE COPS WON'T HAVE THAT
CHASIN' ME FOR MILES AND I'M BLAZIN' WIT THE TOP BACK
SMOKE THE PURPLE HAZE AND I GO THROUGH MY DAMN SACK
ISN'T IT AMAZING THAT THIS STUFF CAN MAKE YOU SO RELAXED?
