Broken down cars (Broken down cars)
Like strung-out old stars (Like strung-out old stars)

Served us so well (Served us so well)
Traveled through hell (Traveled through hell)
Oh, how we fell (Oh, how we fell)

Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama
Lift me up, lift me up
Higher now ama

Making us bold (Making us bold)
So strong out and cold (So strong out and cold)
I'm feeling so old (I'm feeling so old)
Plain talking (Plain talking)
Has ruined us now (Has ruined us now)
You'll never know how (You'll never know how)
Sweeter than doubt (Sweeter than doubt)
