Flavor of the frickin’ week, critics say you’re spitting heat
I say you lack the minerals to skin a beat convincingly
Got a thousand faces, a lotta doubt and hatred
Recording albums naked, you can take it how you take it
I got mild tourettes, got X-Files connects
Reptiles for pets who fuck other reptiles to death
Framing it up, everything I came to discuss
Is courtesy of good books and some dangerous drugs
Yeah we got some new shit my neighbors just love
Cuz I cranked it up to eleven every day for a month, yup
...got proud mistakes, I’ve got down and prayed
Lost countless games until I dropped out of frame, cut
...got hopeless, upped the raw dosage
Now I’m making power plays in fuzzy soft focus
With a face full of acid, my life is straight page turner status
Paperback mass made murder madness
Like Stephen King getting hit with a van
Same shit, now I’m a different man, just give it a chance...
Went from stupid cynical to “way too political” quick
It’s never fashionable giving a shit, but shit
If it’s not a revolution, I’ll take an occupation
But if it’s not an occupation then I’m better off just moving
Exactly what the fuck is wrong with white people today?
I’ve watched a lotta closet racists go completely insane
Please, say you’re not racist...bro, it’s so obvious
He’s a black George Bush and y’all are calling him a communist
Look....I’m not saying I have faith in my leaders
I’m saying, fuck your Fox News motivational speakers
Fuck every last democrat, all republicans
Plus the dumb-as-shit citizens who vote these blooduckers in
And if you’re listening, that’s probably you
...so stay tuned and turn the volume up, too
Like: Tea Party Nation.. here’s the situation...
Your grandma was an activist... FOR segregation
Against brown vs. the board of education
March to montgomery, she was there waiting
...but brainwashing is a dangerous game
So granny had a daughter and she raised her to hate
She lied about Jesus and she claimed it was Faith
And she filled her with guilt that remains to this day
But if you’re an 80’s baby, the hate’s undercover
It’s baked in the system, the guns and the butter
Claiming that victims create what they suffer
Made welfare queens out of poor black mothers
Languages changes, but goals remain
That’s exactly why the CIA sold cocaine
Now this is not a secret, it’s an open case
All those men are still alive and we know their names
...powdernose rappers wanna floss in the source
I just want an honest talk with Oliver North
Like I just want a couple million dollars or more
Fuck status, get power, that is all that it’s for
Conspiracies are nothing, the big open secret
Is how we all slit our own throats but won’t believe it
And every rebel wants to fight the machine
It’s easier than questioning the life that we lead, peaceYou might also like
