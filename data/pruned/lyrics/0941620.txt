I got a feeling coming on
Life is taking way too long
I'll see you when I'm home
I see a madman on the wall
A burning church and human flaw
But you leave that alone

[Verse 2]
I got a feeling that comes around
The dogs of war, I put 'em down
I hear them cry and beg
I gave a poor man a dime or two
He saved my soul with gratitude
And gave his life; yes, he did

[Pre-Chorus]
God really knows us all
God really knows us all
And God really knows us all

[Chorus]
Please, I know it's too late
For my eyes to open
Now I see the door closing
I need more time, but it's over
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
I got a feeling coming on (Feeling coming on)
I got a feeling coming on (Feeling coming on)
I got a feeling coming on (Feeling coming on)
I got a feeling coming on (Feeling coming on)
I got a feeling coming on (Feeling coming on)

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
So, please, I know it's too late
For my eyes to open
I feel the door closing
I see myself getting older
I got a feeling I'll never be free
Until it's over

[Outro]
I got a feeling coming on
Life is taking way too long
I'll see you when I'm home
