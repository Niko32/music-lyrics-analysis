Under the evening stars we walk
The smell of cool, damp earth beneath my feet
On a summer night in the orchard
My car is parked down, side of the road
Over the mountain, a red moon glows
Soon the summer will be over in the orchard

[Verse 2]
I've been to this place so many times
Down roads and rows of dreams in my mind
I'm walking through the trees in the orchard
Still I see it when I close my eyes
When sleep's about to come after a restless night
I go there in my dreams, back to the orchard

[Chorus]
The seasons of my life, I watched them pass
Blossoms of spring fall, leaving only winter's naked branch
I remember you and me in the orchard

[Verse 3]
As the days of youth slip farther from my grasp
Still it haunts me, like a song I can't forget
And now frost covers the ground in the orchard
And when the spark of life is almost gone
The seasons slow then stop, and I'll see spring no more
It calls me into forever in the orchard
You might also like[Chorus]
The seasons of my life, I watched them pass
Blossoms of spring fall, leaving only winter's naked branch
I remember you and me in the orchard
In the orchard
