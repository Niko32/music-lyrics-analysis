Living alone, knowing my self
Learning my own, is just me
Never had friends, always alone
Never had help, is just me
Living alone, knowing my own
Learning myself, is just me
I'm stuck all alone, in a place full of clones
We're all up in hell, is just me

[Verse 1: Shamman Hippy]
I never had friends
They never supported this tape
They never respected my click
They never supported my takes
But they always talking down on my shit
God damn, I never forgot
My own damn homies from the mf block
They laughed in my face, I wanted to pop
But now I'm going big, they steady on my jock

[Chorus: Shamman Hippy]

[Verse 2: Shamman Hippy]
I grew up in pac full of Gs
We were so God damn notorious big
Smoking Big Ls, that's all they fucking did
I was rapping out my big puns
They wanted out the big guns
But damn where's my friends now?
Where they at?
I'm separated from the snakes everyday, in my lane
If I ever get the fame
I bet they will be back damn
You might also like[Chorus: Shamman Hippy]

[Verse 3: Shamman Hippy]
Back to the back, but fuck that
Always been alone and I like it better like that
Alone, lonely stuck in a place a full of clones
That never can't think for they own
IPhones and a smoke in they hands but no mind and no soul
Shamman levitated elevated with no smoke
But a Mic, and no friends in my life just alone alone

[Chorus x2: Shamman Hippy]
