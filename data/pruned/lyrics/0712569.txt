Aye I'll be fine just let me sip my grey soda yeah!
Yeah-yeah Yeah-yeah Yeah-yeah
I`ll be fine
Hey


(Verse 1)

Tell a hoe to juice me
Talk to show the true me
Speak to tell the spoken I'm out spoken you can't out do me
Q'Rasso be the greatest
Q be the illest
Q'Raun be the don you found fond of put him on your play list
Play this on your rainy days
When you tend to fade away
When your not a ten but your bae love any ways
Play it when you're lonely
Know your not the only
One day you might Fall in love
And always have a homie
They never showed me the brighter side
I always had to find it
They find me feeling fine
Like I put that shit behind me
But really on some real shit that shit was  right be side me
Who put that shit beside me
That's probably
One way at looking at it
Two ways to feeling better
Better get the fuck over it
Or over you will be forever
Climbing these topless ladder
Dodging some bitch that's topless
To top it off I finally I got a top to top
The bottles I was filling
Done fell over fuck these feelings
Not humbled Q. be the realest
I fumbled over the biggest
Middle finger sent from the heavens
Yo I haven't found the reason
I haven't found the reason
Why please someone who don't give fuck about you
If you don't like me you can eat a dick or suck two
I'm lighting fires burning bridges that I fell through
You don't understand me
So fall back over the rock you walk through
I'm spitting fire
But if You don't feel it that's cool
You'll get the second hand
Like Q'Raun  wrote  my testament
Heating up the church pews
Fucking up my virtues
Virtually I'm perfect but I'm allergic to having horse shoes
But

I'll be fine just let me my sip my grey soda (x7)
