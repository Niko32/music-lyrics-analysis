He was looking to sell some weed
He was doin' fine, they were standing in line
It was excellent weed indeed
He came across a young man who was likewise peddling pot
And the devil slid down the beach and said
"Boy, let me tell you what"

I guess you kinda figured I'm a reefer head of course
And after all this time, I guess that I'm a connoisseur of sorts
Now your stuff smells ok, but this can tranquilize a horse
I bet a million in cash against your stash
'cause I think mine's better then yours."
The boy said my name's Johnny and you ain't smoked nothing yet
One hit of this grass'll kick your ass, you got yourself a bet."

Johnny, roll a ball of hash and make sure its the bomb
Cause the devil's got the kinda stuff they smoke in Vietnam
You'll get a million smackaroos in cash if you can cope
But if you can't the devil gets your dope

The devil packed a bong with a little Acapulco gold
And resin flew from his fingertips as he fired up his bowl
He filled that chamber all the way and he took a mighty hit
And as they passed it back and forth
It gave them both a coughing fit
You might also likeWhen the bowl was finished Johnny said
"Hey man that stuff was great
But fill your lungs with some of this
And prepare to vegetate"

Cannabis, sativa sweet Mary Jane
The devils in the back yard frying his brain
Zig zag filled with the diggidy dank
Hold on tight it'll hit you like a tank

The devil nodded off because he knew that he was stoned
And he asked if he could buy an ounce
Of the stuff that Johnny owned
Johnny said "Devil just come on back
If you ever want to catch a buzz
I done told you once you son of a bitch
Mine's the best there ever was"

Fired up doobies one by one
Ain't gonna stop till the bags done
Green as a bull frog sticky as glue
Granny do you get high yes I do
