I never did like that apartment
It was not a place I like to be
In summertime the place was hot
In wintertime I'd sit around and freeze
I never did like that apartment seems to me
It always smell like food
People down the hall complained
Because I liked to pick and sing
And anyway the rent was overdue

[Chorus:]
Cloudy day this is my cloudy day

[Verse 2:]
One for you and one for him o
One for her and one for them

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
I've forgot the number of the Interstate that brought me to this town
I've been here for seven months
And still I do not know my way around
Well I'd like to find a quiet place
And trouble is I don't know where it's at
I don't know which way is best but I think I'll be headin' west
So I'll be walkin' where the land is flat
You might also like[Chorus]

[Verse 4:]
I've know people higher up the ladder
Who can always pick and choose
Anything they want to be or anyplace they go to just can't lose
It doesn't matter who you are
We all must have a cloudy day some time
Days that we can't seem to win
Days that we ain't got a friend
We all have days and I guess this is mine

[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
One for you and one for him one for her and one for them

[Chorus]
