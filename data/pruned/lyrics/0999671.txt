I was sixteen, met you out in Ohio
You were only fifteen, living life by the mile
We laid under the stars, fell asleep in your backyard
You said you could fly
But you never need to, 'cause with us you never try too hard
And you never will

[Chorus]
On a lonely night, you will see
You're everything to me (you got everything)
On a lonely night, oh the truth
Is every night is lonely without you
Every night is lonely without you here

[Verse 2]
We are older now, and you came back to Ohio
You whispered something to me I haven't heard in a while
I wish I could lie and just tell you I'm fine
You wouldn't believe me if you tried
If I listen to our song, I'll be up all night

[Chorus]
On a lonely night, you will see
You're everything to me (you got everything)
On a lonely night, oh the truth
Is every night is lonely without you
Every night is lonely without you here
You might also like[Bridge]
It's been forever, lately it's been hard
Like when we took your parents' car
And drove forever in the dark
I'd give it all away if I could see you once again and have a summer love
Growing close and then we'll grow old

[Chorus]
On a lonely night, you will see
You're everything to me (you got everything)
On a lonely night, oh the truth
Is every night is lonely without you
Every night is lonely without you here

And every guy would be lonely without you there
