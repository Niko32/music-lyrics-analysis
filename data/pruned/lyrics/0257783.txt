Hold up, these boys frontin' like they movin blocks
Like big dope slangers on swangers, cruisin' drops
I can't stand niggas rappin' like they use them Glocks
You ain't no ball hog, nigga, you ain't shootin' up shots
Niggas claim to have stripes like a referee
But you ain't callin' no shots nigga technically
This ain't a game this is life the only techs you'll see
Is not fouls just guns that reset your T-I-M-E
Some niggas fake it til they make it
They tell lies, then they wish that they could erase it
Face it, there ain't no facts in none of ya statements
You ain't wearing guns like it's a fashion statement
I know you gon' hate this, talkin' to you mista
Smile when they with ya and when they leave they diss ya
See niggas gon' wish ya don't get no richer
I'll snap with no Kodak and hope that you get the picture
Now let's keep it real, are you really a vulture?
That'll make a nigga as stiff as a picture on a poster
Tell the truth, if a hater get up and approach ya
Would you make that nigga wish he stayed seated like a sofa
Most of, well let me say a large percent
Of these keepin' it real niggas is fraudulent
I know you thought you had ya boy convinced
But you fake, you phony, you know the rest
You might also like[Chorus: Chamillionaire & Paul Wall]
If you ain't never been behind bars, but said you did time
You fake, you phony, you falsifying
If you ain't killed nobody, but in your songs they dyin'
You fake, you phony, you falsifying
You ain't a hustler on your grind, but you claim to move pounds
You fake, you phony, you falsifying
Never have, never did, never will be real
Wrong, you're lying, you falsifying

[Verse 2: Paul Wall]
Calling your bluff
A lot of rappers claim to be tough
You bout as tough as toilet tissue full of that brown stuff
Your commode is about to erupt
You think you're hot doggin, but ya ketchup is catchin up
Tomorrow ya stuck
Ya rims cost more than ya truck
You a balla, but you always wanna borrow a buck
My worst rap is better than ya best song
Ya'll boi's faker than Li press ons
Rappin hard, but the streets know lie bout drama
When ya dog died, you went home and cried to ya mama
You'll get devoured in this game like a wildebeest
With your white gold chain and your silver piece
Please, don't make me laugh
You slab when you rap, but in real life you catchin' a cab
I saw you at the club with that fine chick you was huggin'
Tellin' me it was your gal, but it's really your cousin
You fake, you phony, you exaggeratin'
If you a mack, why you always home masturbating?
You ain't gotta lie to me about the cash you making
Quit acting and faking
For real
[Chorus: Chamillionaire & Paul Wall]
If you ain't never been behind bars, but said you did time
You fake, you phony, you falsifying
If you ain't killed nobody, but in your songs they dyin'
You fake, you phony, you falsifying
You ain't a hustler on your grind, but you claim to move pounds
You fake, you phony, you falsifying
Never have, never did, never will be real
Wrong, you're lying, you falsifying

[Verse 3: Chamillionaire]
If I took a look into your mind
Facts or fiction tell me which one would I find?
If I took a look into your mind
Would a lie detector tell me that you are lying?
All them killers that you're hangin' around
Or if It really went down, would ya guerillas be cryin'?
Some of ya'll need to correct ya mind
I know you lyin', you falsifyin'
So true, stacking money is what I do
Always been real I'mma stay true
Nigga what about you?
And I know I know I will because
Real is pulsing through my blood
Some niggas claim to be real thugs, is it really the truth?
And I know just let me know
