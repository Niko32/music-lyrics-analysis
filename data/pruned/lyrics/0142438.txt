Oooooooo
Whoo

[Verse 1]
The jokes on me, as you can see
I forgot to say, the reason
The song above, is about love
But not, in a real sense

[Verse 2]
I think it's nice to see, how people love
To cover the comedic relief
That's not everyone's belief
When people are in love, they don't see what
I see and feel, exactly what I feel
Because they can't obtain, what I can
In their brains

[Chorus]
The Jokes is also on me, as you can plainly see
So dance and prance
The Jokes is also on me, as you can plainly see
So dance and prance

[Verse 3]
The jokes is on me, and no one else
This joke is on me, and on no one else
I lied to you last time
Last time, Last time
You might also like[Chorus]
The Jokes is also on me, as you can plainly see
So dance and prance with jubilee
As if you had those sneakers
My dear old friend Jeorgie

[Verse 4]
Oh dance and prance, as if you were free
As if you had those sneakers, my dear old friend Jeorgie
As if you had those sneakers, my dear old friend
As if you had those sneakers, my dear old friend Jeorgie

[Outro]
This song is to you, so don't forget me now
Cuz I know I won't forget about you now
