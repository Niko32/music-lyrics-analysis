I jump up on this train, girl try it
I told you money ain't no thang, girl, I'll buy it
I'm talkin diamond rings and designer clothes
Since I seen you on that video
How could I tell Ciara no? (No, no, no, no)
You ridin' on that thing like a rodeo-deo-deo
Round and round and round
Here we go, we go, we go, we go
She ridin' that like a sports car
Ridin that like a porn star
If you wanna ride Bei Maejor let me know

[Verse 2: Andre 3000]
I can look at your face and know the pussy﻿ good
You wanna give me your taste but don't know how to do it
Without feelin like one a many
Honey actin like she don't wanna give me any
I said actin like she don't wanna give me any
And I’ll do the same thing if I was a Minnie
But I'm a Mickey
And thats where it gets tricky
To get partci-
Lar wit her, It occurred to me
When a stirin stir
That stirs up them emotions
Come came an ocean
Tom tom drums and kicks
And im supposed to stop fuckin with her cause a nigga getting older
Nah motherfucker but a nigga getting colder
Call me whatever never call me a poser
Y'all you see the devil better all be much older
Y'all see Ciara better call me right over
Chaka Khan fine, Anita Baker sweet
Hope you don't mind if I fuck wit ya beat
Hope you don't mind if a nigga go deep
You might start crying tears fall on me
Chest feel like a whirlpool for ants
I shoulda known better cau' the girl can dance
I should wrote a letter bout the world's advance
Andre 3000 I'm a fan

I can do it big
I can do it long

I can do it up and down
I can do circles
To him I'm a gymnist
This room is my circus

[Chorus: Ciara]

And I won't stop, don't stop
Get it! Get it!

Baby, hit it! hit it!
[Verse 3: Ciara]

Handle my business, like a big girl should

[Verse 4: Ludacris]
(I love the way you ride the beat baby, I love it!)
She ride it like a rollercoaster
Soon as I get her to the top she screams
I put her out like a her lights
She'll be out for the night
When her head hit the pillows sweet dreams
Wake her up about 30 minutes later
Calling me the terminator, let's go again
Red zone, I'mma get her first down
Call me Luda Drew Brees I throw it in
Touch down, he scores
Ludacris the MVP
With a rack like that and a back like that
CiCi better CC me
Cause them legs just keep on going
So I gotta put her to bed
Let the 808 thump, and the beat go bump
Cause she ride it like a thoroughbred
[Chorus: Ciara]
He love they way I ride it
He love they way I ride it
He love the way I ride the beat
Like a motherf*cking freak

[Bridge: Ciara]
Oh baby baby baby
Do me like you up when I'm up
When I'm done, when I'm done
Oh baby baby baby
You can stand to look away
When I'm whirling this around
Oh baby baby you like it
Once it get up and down
Oh baby he love it when
I twirl this thing all around

[Outro: Ciara]
He love the way I ride it
He love they way I ride it
He love they way I ride it
He love the way I ride the beat
Like a motherfucking freak
