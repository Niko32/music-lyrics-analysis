Do you know, do you know what's going on inside my mind
Can you save, only save this moment being like mankind
Loving you like I do you know I'd spend my life with you
The love you show that can grow and mend this broken heart of mine
CHORUS
Take a hold of my hand, show what it can be like
Take a hold of my hand and I will take you there...
I'll bring you heaven
Together with a falling star
I'll bring you heaven
A miracle from afar...
This must be heaven
Can I ask, only ask the one thing burning in my eyes
Will you stay, only stay so close now right here by my side
CHORUS
And I will take you there...
I'll bring you heaven
Together with a falling star
I'll bring you heaven
A miracle from afar...
This must be heavenYou might also like
