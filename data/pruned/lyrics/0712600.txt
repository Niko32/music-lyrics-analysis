My life taking over the country
My life yeah taking over the sea
My life is a path to glory, no frills for me

[Verse 2]
I said one world yeah is it good enough?
I said one world yeah is it bad enough
One world as a path to glory, no frills for me

[Chorus]
I said you’re all the same
You’re all the same
You’re all the same
You’re all the same
You’re all the same
You’re all the same
You’re all the same
You’re all the same

[Verse 3]
So you think you're something you think you know yeah
But you just contribute to the lies they sold you well
I got some news for you, you don't talk for me

[Verse 4]
I said one world is it good enough?
I said one world yeah is it bad enough
One world as a path to glory no frills for me
You might also like[Chorus]
