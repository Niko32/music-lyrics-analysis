Never ending sorrow
Only the past with
Uncertain tomorrow
Oh God the pain
That I've been going through
Raining in my heart
To my emotional rescue

I used to be
So far from life
No one could help me
Not even my wife
Oh God the pain
That I've been going through
Raining in my heart
To my emotional rescue

Happy days are here again
The sky is blue and clear again
Everybody I talk to
Says, man, you're looking cool

Nature oh nature is slow to heal
Nature oh nature please let me feel
When he was?
You might also likeOh my gosh happy days are here again
I can see the twinkle in the people's eyes
Goodbye blues, happy days are here again
Spread it good
