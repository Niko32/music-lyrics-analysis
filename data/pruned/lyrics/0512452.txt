Summer nights on the beach
Underneath the rain drops
Wind blowing through ya hair
This is what it feels like

Rose petals in the tub
Listening to your favorite song
Every time our bodies touch
This is what it feels like

[Robert]
Any place that you wanna explore
I'm down and I'm assuming that you
Already know what pleases me

[Qwanell]
I think I'm bout to lose it
Just watching you move it real slow
Don't let it go

[Robert]
No need to speed up the pace
I can replace the best you had
And redefine what passion is
Got me feeling all kinds of way
You know I can't wait anymore
Baby when I'm with you its like
You might also like[Chorus]
Summer nights on the beach
Underneath the rain drops
Wind blowing through ya hair
This is what it feels like

Rose petals in the tub
Listenin' to your favorite song
Every time our bodies touch
This is what it feels like

[Will]
Like a brand new pair of shoes from your favorite designer
Thats how it feels whenever you touching me (OoOo)
Loving you ain't hard to do cause I..
I feel so alive when I'm in your arms ooooh

No need to speed up the pace
I can replace the best you had
And redefine what passion is
Got me feeling all kinds of ways
You know I can't wait anymore baby
When I'm with you it's like 0o0o0

[Chorus]
Summer nights on the beach (underneath the sun )
Underneath the rain drops
Wind blowin' through ya hair
This is what it feels like (This is what it feels like)
Rose petals in the tub
Listening to your favorite song
Every time our bodies touch
This is what it feels like

[Robert]
So hot up in this room
Like a summer's heat in June
Gotta suite thats made for two
So turn the lights out
Hold on just stay right there
Don't move girl let me stare
Your fragrance in the air
Tell me what it feels like

[Chorus 2x]
Summer nights on the beach (On the beach)
Underneath the rain drops (Rain drops)
Wind blowing through ya hair
This is what it feels like

Rose petals in the tub
Listening to your favorite song
Every time our bodies touch
This is what it feels like
[Bridge]
Hey
Come here baby
Let me whisper something in your ear
This is what it feels like yeah

[Chorus]
Summer nights on the beach
Underneath the rain drops
Wind blowing through ya hair
This is what it feels like

Rose petals in the tub
Listening to your favorite song
Every time our bodies touch
This is what it feels like
