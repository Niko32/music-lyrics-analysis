Except for the written word
I was born in such foolish times
My guilt is guaranteed
Now i don't want to burn in hell
John told me that i would
Unless i went down to the water
My sins purged in his holy blood

See how they run..sheep to the fold
See how they fall..corpse from the cross

Now i've got my bleeding heart
And i wear my crown of thorns
And argue with the old men
About the tapestry was torn
I 've got to sacrifice my ego
It's such a small price to pay
I'm waiting for the resurrection
Gonna find out what christ would say

See how they run..sheep to the fold
See how they fall..corpse from the cross
See how they run..sheep to the fold
See how they fall..corpse from the cross

I've got to find the truth
Sending loads of telegrams to god
Prove my faith is absolute
Going down down on my knees and pray
Maybe i'll buy a talisman
Somethings got to save me
On the judgement day

See how they run..sheep to the fold
See how they fall..corpse from the cross
See how they run..sheep to the fold
See how they fall..corpse from the cross
