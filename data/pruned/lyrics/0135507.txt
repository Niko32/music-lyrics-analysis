Let me see where she has gone
Let me see where she has gone
Let me see where she has gone
Help me back south with my changed love
I never told her where the fear comes from
I never told her where the fear comes from
I never told her where the fear comes from
Half way through nine, she won't have come
Or seen where I have been in the time we were undone
In the time we were undone
In the time we were undoneYou might also like
