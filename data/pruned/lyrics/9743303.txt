[Verse 1]
I don't wanna go 'til everything comes crashin' down
You're the one I want when everything comes crashin' down
그냥 왜인지 난
너가 돌아올 것 같은데
I don't wanna go 'til everything comes crashing down
You're the one I want when everything comes crashing down

[Chorus]
Could you tell me once again, again? (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
널 안아줬던 그 날 처럼 오늘도 비가 오고 있어
Could you kill me once again, again? (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Cause I know, I know
I'll be loving you
I'll be loving you
I'm still loving you
Baby, you know I'd die for you

[Verse 2]
네가 떠오르면 나는 미쳐 (Yeah)
사실 아직 안믿겨 (Yeah)
늦었을지도 모르지만 let you know (Yeah)
어떤 멜로디도
그 어떤 스토리도 내겐
네의 잔상일 뿐인데 (뿐인데)
I know it is way too late (I know it is way too late)
I know it is way too crazy (I know it is way too)
But if you give me one more chance
You might also like[Chorus]
Could you tell me oncе again, again? (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
날 떠나갔던 그 날부터 하루도 잊은적 없어 난
Could you kill me once again, again? (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Cause I know, you know
I'll bе loving you (Oh)
I'll be loving you (Oh)
What's wrong? (Ooh)
Baby, you know I'd die for you (Oh)

[Outro]
I would die for you
I would die for you
I would die for you
I would die for you
