'Kay

[Verse 1: Phoebe Bridgers]
Back in the States now
In a college town
I would walk around
But it's really comin' down
Mesmerized by double lines
Two yellow tightropes
I'm makin' good time

[Chorus: All]
I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know

[Verse 2: Julien Baker]
Bein' in love
Is the same thing as bein' alone
Givin' the sorrow some company
Nothing to say
But stay on the phone
No, I'm sorry I do not know
What else you want from me
You might also like[Chorus: All]
I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know

[Verse 3: Lucy Dacus]
You say, "How are you?"
I say, "I don't know
Let's dissolve the band
Move to Idaho"
Everyone's around
And I hear you smiling
You say, "I love you"
I say, "You too"

[Chorus: All]
I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough to know

[Bridge: All]
Ooh
Ooh
[Chorus: All]
I am never anywhere
Anywhere I go
When I'm home, I'm never there
Long enough
