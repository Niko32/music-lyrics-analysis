Don't be sad darling, I love you
And I'll take you with my soul's memory
I'm just going ahead to tell them about you
So they will all know you the way that I do

[Chorus]
And I'll meet you dear on the blue side of heaven
Where angels sing and days never end
And I'll dance with you on the blue side of heaven
Where God will bless our love once again

[Verse 2]
I'll teach them all the songs that we love dear
And I'll tell them of our babies at home
I'll hug and kiss all of our loved ones
Who came before so I'm not alone

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
So let me go and tell me you love me
I'm not afraid as darling, I know
That someday soon you'll be there with me
We'll be together as long as time goes
You might also like[Chorus]

[Outro]
So don't be sad you know that I love you
And I'll see you when it comes to your time
We'll walk along some beautiful river
Hand in hand on life's other side
