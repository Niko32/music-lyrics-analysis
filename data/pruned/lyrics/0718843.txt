Just a singing my poor song
I've seen them hard hard times
But that's my kind of life

I like it most the time
When I'm drunk and feeling high
Sometimes it gets me down
Makes me feel I'm unwound

And I know it's hard
When you're all alone
And you don't wanna live
And you've got that gun

Hang on
Hang on
Hang on
Hang on

Well, I'm cruisin' all alone
Just a singing my poor song
I've seen them hard hard times
But that's my kind of life

I like it most the time
When I'm drunk and feeling high
Sometimes it gets me down
Makes me feel I'm unwound
