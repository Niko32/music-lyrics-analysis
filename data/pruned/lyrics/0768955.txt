Sugar and honey is what I'd die for
And darlin' doll you make my life worthwhile
Because I want you sugar and honey

Sugar and honey, keep me goin
Sugar and honey, I been a-knowin'
Well every time your lovin' lips meet mine

Sugar and honey, for the flavor

It's alright, sugar and honey, mornin' noon and night
Yeah sugar and honey anytime, ah sugar and honey all the time
