And watch the fleeting changes of life's uneven ways
But if my Savior calls me to that sweet home on high
I'll live with Him forever in glory by and by

Oh yes, I'll live in glory, live in glory by and by
I'll tell and sing love's story, tell love's story there on high
There with my dear Redeemer no more, no more to die
Oh yes, I'll live in glory by and by

I'd like to be of service along this pilgrim way
And lead the lost to Jesus as fervently I pray
As day by day I'm gonna travel I'll keep him ever nigh
And I'll live with Him Forever in glory by and by

Oh yes, I'll live in glory, live in glory by and by
I'll tell and sing love's story, tell love's story there on high
There with my dear Redeemer no more, no more to die
Oh yes, I'll live in glory by and by

Oh, you know the end I know is nearing, by faith I look away
To yonder home supernal, the land of endless day
I'll cling to Him forever and I'll look beyond the sky
And live with Him forever in glory by and by

Oh yes, I'll live in glory, live in glory by and by
I'll tell and sing love's story, tell love's story there on high
There with my dear Redeemer no more, no more to die
Oh yes, I'll live in glory by and by
