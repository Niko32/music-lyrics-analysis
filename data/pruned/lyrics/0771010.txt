We can't see quite right
We've lost the plot and we can't get it back
So let's lose ourselves, let's lose ourselves

Can you spot the English here?

Let's pick a fight on whomever we like
Cause we're never wrong
Nobody likes us, we don't care
So let's lose ourselves, let's lose ourselves

Can you spot the English here?

We can see it for real
But it doesn't make sense
We're the outsiders
We can see all this speech
Come staggering out
And we can climb its way
To the top of that cloud

I'm away with the fairies now
I'm away with the fairies now
I'm away with the fairies now
I'm away with the fairies now
You might also likeThis familiar environment
Gets my lungs confused
I breathe in every particle
That you drive thru, that you drive thru

Well can you spot the English here?

We can see it for real
But it doesn't make sense
We're the outsiders
We can see all this speech
Come staggering out
And it can its way to the top
Of that cloud

Oh I'm away with the fairies now
I'm away with the fairies now
I'm away with the fairies now
I'm away with the fairies now
