Dippin' n sippin', dip, dippin' n sippin'
Dip, dippin' n sippin', dip, dippin' n sippin'
I'm on the 105 freeway, doin' 110
Patron in my cup and I'm ridin' with my friends
Dippin' n sippin', dip, dippin' n sippin'
Dip, dippin' n sippin', dip, dippin' n sippin'
Just re'd up, so a nigga feelin' good
Got four racks on me on the way to the hood
Say woah-oah

[Verse 1: YG]
Hit the block, then I stop
'Cause I'm drunk, and I'm hot
A nigga drunk a grip, so a nigga gotta piss
Pocket full of money, wit another nigga's bitch
I don't give a fuck, nigga don't give a shit
I'm a skinny ass nigga wit a long ass dick
And a nigga on, nigga faded
Bitch said she pregnant but I ain't finna claim it
So a nigga ridin, drunk drivin
Feelin' like I'm glidin', cause a nigga slidin'
Just re'd up so a nigga great
My bitch do shopping spree's your bitch can't
And my whip filled up with the homies
Drunk drivin' so I'm hidin' from the police
I'm on the freeway, ay fuck the speed limit
And I'mma crash in my bedroom with 3 bitches
