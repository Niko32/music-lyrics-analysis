Tired as fuck I’m bout to pass out
You know how many blunts I've done ashed out?
Way way more than a thousand
Way way out here in loud land
In a week smoke a pound now
Your lungs weak, chronic strong you can't have none
Gets some reggie thats the shit you can handle
But don’t pass that, I’m not around for it

I’m the star smoking 0s by the pound boy
The handheld phone help you picture that story
I'm look down at you specks from the top story
You fucking clowns lack respect for your god's glory
Blind must've lost both your eyes surely
Can’t even recognize God clearly
Bullet thru your temple your demise Shirley
Singing and dancing back up in time birdie
Zip it and listen get back in line buddy
Dip and abort mission you're out of time sorry
Back up your bags and get out of town hurry
You painting the fence and I’m Tom Sawyer
I’m losing patience, don’t got time for ya
Got groupies waiting they like “i love you”
I love yah, all of you
Can suck ya, can fuck ya, Can i secure
You might also likeOf course you can
Get coarse pop that pussy like a cork for me
Busting pussy juice all on the upholstery
Hopefully don't leave a stain for the folks to see
Focus please cause you not riding this pony like you supposed to be
Sathi please don't let go of me
Girl I already made you come copiously
So it's about damn time you got home and leave

Ain't no good pussy on this goddam planet
Shiiiit I'm getting on this motherfucking rocket
Shit I'm getting off this motherfucking rock
Where's my weed, where's my weed
Can't forget the fucking wraps


Shut the fuck up lets get to sparking now
Kush God's High School but they dropping out
Pass the piece eyes low yeah they dropping now
Out this world so you know i keep the Spock around
I love Klingon women they cling on to me
Foreheads rough but I love them ridges
Panties dropping like London bridges
Steady slopping foreheads rub on britches
Man fuck these riches
I need more alien bitches
Extra terrestrial titties
Jump in the bed with me
That's pure festivity
That puss bomb dignity
Hell yeah digging it
Cock out the jeans
Proceeds to seed
The crossing genes
Fucking while blunted so Im coming in peace
Spawn come out cunning and keen
With a forehead suited for crumbling green
But unfortunately I’m back in CT
To spread my decree and get degree
His presence is raising degrees
Pose as Poseidon than leave you at sea
Can't you see i am the one
You my son just padawan
Need run home and get some padding on
Cause I’ve been holding tech since the Oldowan
Getting better as the competition gets older and older and older and older and
Masters of sky walking like obi wan
But don’t need a lightsaber to smolder songs
Ass is grass watch me mow the lawn
Puff some gas to keep my motor on
Told ya all
This the unfolding of
The chosen one
Smoking on Some Potent stuff
Float around HIs mojo awesome
Be cautious
Cause he's coming for your conscious
Ain't no stopping
He's stomping
Blow up on the conches

The King of the Conscious is coming, all hail him x
