Come on everybody, take a trip with me
Well, down the Mississippi down to New Orleans
They got the Honey Suckle's bloomin' on the Honey Suckle vine
And love is a-blooming there all the time

You know every Southern Bell is a Mississippi Queen
Down the Mississippi down to New Orleans

Yeah
I said a hey, hey, hey yeah

Come on take a stroll down to Basin Street
Yeah, listen to the music with the dixieland beat
A-where the magnolia blossoms fill the air
Yeah, and if you ain't been to heaven then you ain't been there

They got the French moss hangin' from a big oak tree
Down the Mississippi down to New Orleans

I said a hey, hey, hey yeah

Come on everybody, take a trip with me, yeah
Well, down the Mississippi down to New Orleans
They got the Honey Suckle's bloomin' on the Honey Suckle vine
Yeah, and the love is a-blooming there all the time
