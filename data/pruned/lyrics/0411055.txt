[Verse 1]
Pick up the phone, answer your text
Well, I apologize about last night
I really did not mean to disrespect you
You better be alone, no, I'm not obsessed
But if I catch you with somebody else
You know that I am gonna be upset

[Pre-Chorus]
I truly believe that the reason I'm here
Is to tell you the truth that your ending is near
And one day you must look at yourself in the mirror
I still don't think that you are hearing me clear
You must understand that our friendship is done
Justified by the person that you have become
But because of the fact that enough is enough
Now I'm the one that is holding the gun

[Chorus]
Whoa, this will be the end of us
I have tried way too many times to heal
I have loved you so much, it hurts me, dear
And this, this will be the end of us

Pick up the phone
Pick up the phone
Pick up the phone
(Well, I apologize about last night
I really did not mean to disrespect)

[Verse 2]
Pick yourself up, up off the floor
Wipe the tears from off your face
Because the cops are knocking on the door
They're gonna wanna know what's up
Better tell 'em that you fell
'Cause when they see the bruises on my face
They're probably taking both of us to jail

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of fighting each other
The lying, the crying, the calling your mother
The calling of names, I'm bothered and smothered
We kiss and make up and get under the covers
A dangerous cycle I don't understand
The kicking, the screaming, the breaking of lamps
I'll be damned if I see you with some other man
'Cause if I cannot have you, then nobody can
[Chorus]
Whoa, this will be the end of us
I have tried way too many times to heal
I have loved you so much, it hurts me, dear
And this, this will be the end of us

[Bridge]
Death do us part
I thought you would never go straight for my heart
I'm better off living in Hell

[Guitar Solo]
