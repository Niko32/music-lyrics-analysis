The sun that drowns
Everything in gold
Feeling it taking hold
Holding her hand
The hue of her hair
Colouring every care
Willing to share
Who'd understand?

[Pre-Chorus]
As faith breaks down
In the shadow of a cold cathedral

[Chorus]
Make a wish for the one you love
As the storm sets the leaves in motion
Let it blow on the breeze of a deep blue ocean
Love's a bird in the human hand
Feel it breathe as your fingers open
Would it stay here and sing if its wings were broken?
That's the method of love

[Verse 2]
By chance she calls
Shatters the mood I'm in
Letting the light shine in
Bathe me in grace
The trials of time
Course though this heart of mine
Feel her erase
Every trace
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And stand by me
And stand by me
In the deluge of the slings and arrows

[Chorus]
Make a wish for the one you love
As the storm sets the leaves in motion
Let it blow on the breeze of a deep blue ocean
Love's a bird in the human hand
Feel it breathe as your fingers open
Would it stay here and sing if its wings were broken?
Well, that's the method of love
Make a wish for the one you love
As the storm sets the leaves in motion
Let it blow on the breeze of a deep blue ocean
Love's a bird in the human hand
Feel it breathe as your fingers open
Would it stay here and sing if its wings were broken?
Well, that's the method of love
