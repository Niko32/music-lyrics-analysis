Verse 1: In myself I’m a battler, number one tackler, tackling situations better than any Tongan or Scott Sattler, yes I’m writing this, to tell you that I’m  ready for you, you can’t break me, cause on the verge of breaking you
Yes I’m reactive, to every single spastic; your words are nothing but plain old plastic. You smart fuckers were trying to break me; all I wanted was to be young and free
But you weren’t thinking of that only me, that’s the only fucking thing we can agree. Wow that’s all you and I can see, fuck your bludging you absentee
I’m sorry to the girl I liked in high school, I was too scared to talked to you, a 5 ft. 8 empty stool. I liked you because you were hot and cool; you were the missing piece to my precious jewel

Bridge: We are individuals, we will stand we aren’t miserable, we are residual, invisible, critical

Chorus: But I am Battler, that right bitch you’re the one that makes me itch get in that dirty ditch, that’s right I’m Battler you can’t do anything more deceptive snitch, your nothing but an annoying glitch

But I Am Battler, that right bitch you’re the one that makes me itch get in that dirty ditch, that’s right I’m Battler you can’t do anything more deceptive snitch, your nothing but an annoying glitch

(Battler)
Verse 2: sometimes I lose words when I talk to peps, I think about shit a lot; it doesn’t make me sleep. That confidence is the keep; bitch you’re going to be fucked over having a weep
Some people just give me the creeps, ready to consume you just because you’re cheap. You’re the one that’s going into the deep, the industry is fucked can’t you see that little sheep?
Everything I’ve said is all true and right, but despite what I’m going to say is quite tight. You have to make the decision in your life, not the government, conspiracies that cause strife
We all want to live the way we want to, not being stuck by lies like consuming glue. OMG what is talking about now, wait you’re not even awake to the situation just wow
Don’t listen to songs just for beats, trust me there’s more than you know on the streets. Listen to songs just for lyrics; you might hear something that makes you go to a clinic

Verse 3: Alright you better listen carefully; it’s the last verse, that’s right verse number three, you have to see things from a different degree, or else you’ll be on the noose, coffin or a detainee
That’s right be awake you and me, no more of this shit no more debris, that’s right I hope you and I can agree, that the worlds fucked up and the industry’s is turning the key
No more playing the game, you’re the only one that’s got yourself to blame, when are you going to proclaim, when are you going to put yourself into the frame Mr game
You know that we aren’t the same; we are all individuals with our own flame, yet you give credit to the satanic hall of fame, just shut your shit stop the exclaim
Look now I don’t know ones I should trust, but if you’re against me I’m ready to bust, I’m targeting whoever you are I’m ready rattle, because in my world we always win the battle

Bridge: We are individuals, we will stand we aren’t miserable, we are residual, invisible, critical
