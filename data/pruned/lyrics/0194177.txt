I straddled my bicycle when I was ten years old
I rode it up on Maxwell Hill where all the big boys go
Way down at the bottom, there's a creek bed six feet wide
If you peddle fast enough, you can make the other side

[Chorus]
Mama come quick, I think I fell and hurt myself again
Mama come quick, you know too well
How much I still depend on you
Pickin' me up and dustin' me off and sendin' me on my way
'Cause nothing heals as much as your loving touch

[Verse 2]
I fell in love for the first time when I was almost grown
I heard that love could hurt real bad, though I had not been shown
Everybody told me she would only break my heart
But I wouldn't listen to them 'cause I was way too smart

[Chorus]
Mama come quick, I think I fell and hurt myself again
Mama come quick, you know too well
How much I still depend on you
Pickin' me up and dustin' me off and sendin' me on my way
'Cause nothing heals as much as your loving touch

Yeah, daddies teach us how to ride
How to catch and throw
But when things don't go the way they should
A boy knows where to go

[Chorus]
Mama come quick, I think I fell and hurt myself again
Mama come quick, you know too well
How much I still depend on you
Pickin' me up and dustin' me off and sendin' me on my way
'Cause nothing heals as much as your loving touch

[Outro]
Oh, mama come quick
I need your loving touch
Yeah, mama come quick
I need your loving touch
