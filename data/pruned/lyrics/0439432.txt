You might sleep, but you'll never dream
Onward! Progress! Or so it seems
And you might laugh, but you'll never smile
Come on in and waste away awhile
You might sleep, but you'll never dream
Progress! Progress! Come on
And you might laugh, but you'll never smile
Come on in and waste away a long while

Dah!
Dah!
Dah!

[Verse 2]
When dreams of rings of flowers fade and blur
Giving way to that familiar ill
Come over and part your soft white curtains
Where I'm waiting for you still
If you'd unlatch the window
And if you'd let me lay there on your floor
If you'd give me another chance
If you'd forgive the pain I caused before
No use in saying how I'm sorry
So I'm trying not to speak
I'll sing in silence, lay beside you
With my face there on your cheek
My stomach swears there's comfort there
In the warmth of the blankets on your bed
My stomach's always been a liar
I'll believe its lies againYou might also like
