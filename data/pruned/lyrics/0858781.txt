And I always will
Don't confuse my loving you
For me standing still
I wish that I could stay forever
That there ain't no doubt
But the Lord put a song down in my heart
And I've got to let it out
And I've got to answer the call of the road
Got to ride with the ebb and the flow
There ain't no rhyme and no reason
Changin' with the seasons
Tryin' to tread lightly as I go
Well I got to thank my lucky stars
I'm your loving man
I'll always do my best for you
And treat you the best I can
No matter how hard I try
Can't make this calling stop
Now I finally understand
I've been cut from a different block
And I've got to answer the call of the road
Got to ride with the ebb and the flow
There ain't no rhyme and no reason
Changin' with the seasons
Tryin' to tread lightly as I go
Well I heard your momma on the telephone
Sayin' it ain't right
That I'm out on the road somewhere
And you're at home alone at night
I wish that I could stay forever
That there ain't no doubt
But the Lord put a song down in my heart
And I've got to let it out
And I've got to answer the call of the road
Got to ride with the ebb and the flow
There ain't no rhyme and no reason
Changin' with the seasons
Tryin' to tread lightly as I go
There ain't no rhyme and no reason
Changin' with the seasons
Tryin' to tread lightly as I goYou might also like
