Well, I'm going out to San Francisco
They tell me everything out there is really all right
All the boys are cooling on the corner
The little girls out there are really out of sight
You know I'm going to dig all the latest hapenings
And keep my dues paid every night
Went on a little trip last night
And the boys was playing some of them old Fillmore Blues
And every head was right on in there digging
Beautiful vibrations, had some heavy grooves
My chick was right on in there with me in heaven
Yes, we were paying our San Francisco dues
Come on over to me, baby
I want you to satisfy my blues
I want you to let me know how much you really love me
You can tell me any old way you choose
While we lay back and dig the music
And pay our San Francisco duesYou might also like
