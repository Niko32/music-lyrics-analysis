Please send me a postcard now
And if you show your feelings babe
My tape machine will get it somehow

If you got a problem
Don't beg the world for help
And if you need somebody babe
I've got a dog who's jobless now

If you got a message
Please send me a postcard now
And if you got a vision babe
Don't show that movie in this town

Here comes the loser
The master is back, back on the track
Here comes the loser
The master is back, back on the track

If you got a problem
Don't beg the world for help
And if you need somebody baby
I've got a dog who's jobless now

Here comes the loser
The master is back, back on the track
Here comes the loser
The master is back, back on the track
Here comes the loser
The master is back, back on the track
