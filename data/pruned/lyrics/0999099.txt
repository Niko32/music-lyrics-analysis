Would you accept?
Only under one condition
Tell me the things that you can't tell no one
Thoughts that you've kept close to your chest
How long can you disguise what you feel with a song?
All day long, until you feel there's nothing wrong here

Until the truth starts pouring
Just like a storm
My thoughts, I'm torn
I guess I'm just nobody
I guess I'm wrong to feel we belong

If I'm made of rubber, then you're made of glue
All your words bounce off of me, and they get stuck back on you
Him, he's growing the greenest of glass in the land
Head in the sand, hand over hand
I will rebuild till I have what you have
I'll be just like you when I steal your dreams
Right out from under you again

It seems the grass is greener
Just down the road
Someone's house, no one's home
I guess there's just nobody
I guess we're wrong to feel we belongYou might also like
