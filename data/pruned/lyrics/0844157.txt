Worn and tattered, evils of the western world
Real better, over in America
The weather, so serene and calm
Unseasonably warm

Light a candle for the suffering ones
Light a candle for the weak and the small
God damn it there's a lot of 'em
You kind of think that in the modern world

[Verse 2]
Oh the terror, asleep when the alarms went off
You're in the mirror, studying, you're cold and lost
And I love you, let's marry when the time is right
Or whenever you like, well

Say a prayer for all the people that died
Say another for me once in awhile
I hit rock bottom, I'm gettin' old
I was really hoping that the modern world

[Chorus]
Happy livin' in a dumpster world
Break out everybody in the jail
Let's get it on
(Let out the wolves) Let out the wolves
I'm happy living in a dumpster world
(Bring on the booze) Bring out the booze
Start it all
You might also like[Bridge]
And we won't be arrested, for nothing now
Don't you pick up that trash, put more of it on the ground

[Chorus]
(Bust out the drugs) I'm happy living in a dumpster world
(Everyone in jail) Everyone in jail
Yeah let's get it on
(Let out all the wolves) Let out all the wolves
I'm happy living in a dumpster world
(That's mine now) That's mine now
Come and get it on
(Bust out all the drugs) Bust out the drugs

[Outro]
Light a candle for the suffering ones
Light a candle for the weak and the small
Say a prayer for all the people who've gone
There's no hope for any modern world
