I'd be hard pressed to think of one
That makes me feel the way you do
Nothing compares to loving you

Of all the things I've yet to try
There ain't one thing that comes to mind
My running wild days are through
Nothing compares to loving you

I don't need a mountain
I don't need the challenge
I don't need a river to cross
Girl I can't imagine
What could be worth havin'
That turns me on the way you do
Nothing compares to loving you

And one day when I face the Lord
Heaven won't be my reward
Until you're up there with me too
Nothing compares to loving you

I don't need a mountain
I don't need the challenge
I don't need a river to cross
Girl I can't imagine
What could be worth havin'
That turns me on the way you do
Nothing compares to loving you
Nothing compares to loving you
You might also likeThere Ain't nothin' I could ever deam of
That I want more than your sweet love

I don't need a mountain
I don't need the challenge
I don't need a river to cross
Girl I can't imagine
What could be worth havin'
That turns me on the way you do
Nothing compares to loving you
Nothing compares to loving you
Nothing compares to loving you
Oh yeah, oh yeah --
