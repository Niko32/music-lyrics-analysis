Wasting all my time on your smile
Watching all the days pass by
Run away, run away from here

Never knew my lies were so tall
'Til you knocked me out of my mind
Come away, come away, my dear

[Chorus]
So baby, come down to your door, tonight
Blood is pumping with desire
Baby, come down, I see it in your eyes
You wanna set it all on fire, oh

Is this gonna be the love that makes it better?
Are you gonna be the one I hold forever?

[Pre-Drop]
So baby, come down
Are you gonna be the one I hold forever?
Baby, come down
Gonna be the one? Gonna be the one?

So baby, come down
Are you gonna be the one I hold?
So baby, come down
Baby, come
You might also like[Drop]
Baby, come
Baby, come down
Baby, come down

Baby, come down
Baby
Baby, come down

[Verse 2]
Wasting all my time on your smile
Watching all the days pass by
Run away, run away from here

Never knew my lies were so tall
'Til you knocked me out of my mind
Come away, come away, my dear

[Chorus]
So baby, come down to your door, tonight
Blood is pumping with desire
Baby, come down, I see it in your eyes
You wanna set it all on fire, oh

Is this gonna be the love that makes it better?
Are you gonna be the one I hold forever?
Is this gonna be the love that makes it better?
Are you gonna be the one I hold forever?
[Pre-Drop]
So baby, come down
Are you gonna be the one I hold forever?
Baby, come down
Gonna be the one? Gonna be the one?

So baby, come down
Are you gonna be the one I hold?
So baby, come down
Baby, come

[Drop]
Baby, come
Baby, come down
Baby, come down

Baby, come down
Baby
Baby, come down

[Outro]
Is this gonna be the love that makes it better?
Are you gonna be the one I hold forever?
