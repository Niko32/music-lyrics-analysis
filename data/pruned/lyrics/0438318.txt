On my morning walks
Seagulls dip and sway
Over the mossy rocks

Oh feel the wind blowing in
Cool summer days
Boats in the bay
Sailing along

Under a lone palm tree
On my easy rest
Centered in my gaze
Her pretty yellow dress

Oh, Catherine drifts again
Into my mind
Freezing the time
She visits me still

Oh, Marina
Pastel hues
Which one tomorrow
Of your many moods?

Postcard city lights
My late evening walks
Down to Portsmouth Square
Past Sam Wong Hotel
You might also likeOh, Chinatown
Closing down
Ghostly moon mist
Eerily drifts

Oh harp player
On Grant Avenue
Which one tomorrow
Of your haunting tunes?
