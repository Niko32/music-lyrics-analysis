Hopin' that there's a chance that maybe
Oh, baby, you could drop on by

Yeah darlin', you don't have to give me any warnin'
Make it tonight, make it early mornin'
Oh, darlin', just drop on by

I don't have a clue where you might be
Uptown or just down the street in some smoky bar
Oh, I'm a longin' for you, can't help myself
Sendin' out my S.O.S., wherever you are

Oh, honey
I just want your love, I don't need your money
You can turn my gray skies warm and sunny
Oh honey, would you drop on by?

Oh, you and this bottle of warm red wine
Are both workin' on my mind, and I need you now
To fill this emptiness in my soul
Boy, if you were here, I'd never let go, no way, no how

Hey, sugar
I know if we could get back together
We could make this night last forever
Oh sugar, would you drop on by?

Oh, baby, drop on by
