Me hold your hand try to understand
I want a boy like you, tell my troubles to. Don't
Be afraid, you heard what I said

Let the four winds blow, let them blow, let them blow
From the east to the west
I love you the best
Let the four winds blow, let them blow, let them blow
From the east to the west
I love you the best

I like the way you walk, I like the way you talk, let
Me hold your hand, try to understand
I want a boy like you, tell my troubles to. Don't
Be afraid, you heard what I said

Let the four winds blow, let them blow, let them blow
From the east to the west
I love you the best
Let the four winds blow, let them blow, let them blow
From the east to the west
I love you the best

Let the four winds blow, let them blow, let them blow
From the east to the west
I love you the best
Let the four winds blow, let them blow, let them blow
From the east to the west
I love you the bestYou might also like
