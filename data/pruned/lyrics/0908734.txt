Leave it up to life
To bring a good woman down
It took three glasses of wine
Oh, but you're comin' 'round
Go on and let down your hair
Yeah, there's the girl I know
Let's leave the world out there
And lock the door

[Chorus]
Forget about the day you had
It's over, baby, let it be
Every little thing's gone bad
I know exactly what you need
Turn out the lights
And take it all out on me

[Verse 2]
Just bring the bottle to bed
We'll lay there and talk for a while
And when everything has been said
Yeah, we're gonna find your smile

[Chorus]
Forget about the day you had
It's over, baby, let it be
Every little thing's gone bad
I know exactly what you need
Turn out the lights
And take it all out on me

[Chorus]
Forget about the day you had
Yeah, it's over, baby, let it be
Every little thing's gone bad
I know exactly what you need
Turn out the lights
And take it all out on me

[Outro]
Come on, baby
Take it all out on me
Oh
