A firm believer in dreams and how to make em real
And as I shiver with screams I'm lacking of a sleeve
My heart's colder, my soul is darker than the most
I made scrolls of my goals and that you tried to stole
And self control, mmm
Ain't got shit no more

My heart's colder, my soul is darker than the most

Things I lost in that fire I list it as one too
And as the chore is singing, simply thinking of you
My child desires I lost, I'm guessing that I grew
My dreams are now expired, I gotta roll a few
Things I lost in that fire I list it as one too
And as the chore is singing, simply thinking of you
My child desires I lost, I'm guessing that I grew
My dreams are now expired, I gotta roll a few

Whether Grammys, degrees or shit I will lift
Her wet panties and antics, shit that I miss
She wanna leave, mmm

Verse 3

Waving our weapons out the window niggas, we slowly ride
Paving the way heaven I figure we bout to die
My homie lost his life
He lost his life
Now his daughter is wondering why daddy had to die
"Vengeance is mine" said the lord, I tried to remind
My niggas look me like, "Legend is you fucken high?"
Outside we smile, mmm
It's deep down that we cry
Waving our weapons out the window niggas, we slowly ride
Paving the way heaven I figure we bout to die
My homie lost his life
He lost his life
Now his daughter is wondering why daddy had to die
"Vengeance is mine" said the lord, I tried to remind
My niggas look me like, "Legend is you fucken high?"
Outside we smile, mmm

Let's make them real
You might wanna roll or pour a couple for this one
Smoke to it, the pain you'll numb to it
