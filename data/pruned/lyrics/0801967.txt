Let's put a new coat of paint
On this lonesome ol' town
Set 'em up
I'll be knockin' 'em down, down, down
You wear a dress, baby
I'll put on my tie
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon
In a burgundy sky

All our scribbled love dreams
Are lost or thrown away
Here amid the shuffle
Of an overflowing day
Love needs a transfusion
Let's shoot it full of wine
Fishin' for a good time
Starts with throwin' in your line

Put a new coat of paint, baby
On this lonesome ol' town
Set 'em up, set 'em up
I'll be knockin' 'em down
You wear your dress, baby
I'll root out my old tie
We'll laugh at that bloodshot moon
Up in that burgundy sky
You might also likeYes, we will
Laugh laugh laugh laugh
Come on, come on, come on, come on
