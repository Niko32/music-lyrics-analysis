Though you're gone, I can't forget
Right or wrong, I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with the same old regret

All along I thought, I'd lose you
Still I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart please just remember
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you

Right or wrong, I'll always love you
Though you're gone, I can't forget
Right or wrong, I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with the same old regret

All along I thought, I'd lose you
Still I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart please just remember
Right or wrong, I'm still in love with you, oh oh LordYou might also like
