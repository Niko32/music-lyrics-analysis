Streets on fire
Been up for days
Under her spell
She takes me higher
Than anything, I've ever been

[Pre-Hook 1: Erik Hassle]
Yeah, all this shit can change (always)
All this shit can change
She's my one desire
Stronger than anything, I've ever felt

[Hook: Erik Hassle]
When she touch on me and makes me dumb dumb dumb
And when I don't need all her loving, she punish me
Then she's all gone
When she touch on me and makes me dumb dumb dumb
And when I don't need all her loving
Yeah, she's all gone

[Verse 2: Tinashe]
Melting pavements
She looks at me, fevered dream
You can't save me
She's everything, my concrete queen

Ooh, all this shit you can change (always)
All this shit you can change
She takes me higher
Than anything, I've ever been

[Hook: Erik Hassle & Tinashe]
When she touch on me and makes me dumb dumb dumb
And when I don't need all her loving, she punish me
Then she's all gone
When she touch on me and makes me dumb dumb dumb
And when I don't need all her loving
Yeah, she's all gone

[Bridge: Erik Hassle & Tinashe]
You so high deep in secrets
I wear your crown of thorns
With the thickets
All your promises
You took my innocence
I can't go back again
You made me a believer
I wear your crown of thorns cause

[Hook: Erik Hassle & Tinashe]
When she touch on me and makes me dumb dumb dumb
And when I don't need all her loving, she punish me
Then she's all gone
When she touch on me and makes me dumb dumb dumb
And when I don't need all her loving
Yeah, she's all gone
Ooh oh oh
Yeah
She's all gone
She's all gone
She's all gone
Yeah
Oh
She's all gone
She's all gone
