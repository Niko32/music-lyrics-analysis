Walking and walking, thinking on my feet
Anything can happen in the city, but you can't sit down
Building to building, sheltering from the sky
Knowing there's somebody in the street that could change my life

Pick up anything you need
And I'm wishing you were here with me
Walking on a city street

[Verse 2]
Window to window, filling in the hours
Catching my reflection in a place I've never been before
Crossing the bridges, leap the river wide
Knowing not in time, I'll arrive on the other side
