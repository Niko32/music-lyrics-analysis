Had the blues for big town
Yeah, I woke up this mornin'
Had the blues for big town

You know I'm tired of the country
All that people in town
Yeah, I start packing my own suitcase
Yes, I hit that dusty trail

Yes, I hit that dusty trail

You know I'm going to big town
Going to make it my home, alright now

Oh, my polo wagon
She broke down and began to drown
My polo wagon
She broke down and began to drown
Don't stop runnin' around
Runnin' wild round in worry

Oh don't forget it
I did mother your own child
Oh, I'm the mother o' your child

Put it in my telephone
I'm gonna beg my baby
Tell her please let me come back home
