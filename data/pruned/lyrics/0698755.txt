Chip off the old block they say
What you lack in common sense, you make up with ebullience
Transforming the mundane events
A perfect balance

Two parts: tantrums and tidal waves
Two parts: blissful and baby faced

Little one, before you came along I was feeling indigo
Would not have thought a month ago…

Flying out of the holding bay, to the arms of a nobody
Barely independent, say, even with the first few greys
A perfect balance


Two parts: tantrums and tidal waves
Two parts: blissful and baby faced

Little one, before you came along I was feeling indigo
Would not have thought a month ago I could love such a tiny bundle of tidal waves as much
