He woke up screaming here
He needs more oxygen to breathe
Help him up hold him down
Like a freight train
It's bearing down again
He's got holy water in his lungs
Help him up

If that's how it's gonna be
Wake me up wake me up
Pump me full of meds
Don't let me drink from that cup
Slide a little pill down my throat
I'll try to keep it down
Or pull my plug and don't be frightened by the sound

Seventy and ten
Outlived the best of men
He wants to see his little kids again
Help him up
But in all his years
The pain's never been this severe
Now he's spiraling in fear
Hold him down

Wake me up wake me up
Pump me full of meds
Don't let me drink from that cup
Slide a little pill down my throat
I'll try to keep it down
Or pull my plug and don't be frightened by the sound
