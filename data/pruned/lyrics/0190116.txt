Piercing words, eyes are red
Watched your tail lights in the rain
Empty heart filled with regret
I know we were both to blame

[Pre-Chorus: Carrie Underwood]
And I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
So I said all I had to say
In letters that I threw away

[Chorus: Carrie Underwood]
And you should know, please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
But it's been so long, it's never easy
It's like trying to spin the world the other way
What can I say?

[Verse 2: Ashley Clark with Carrie Underwood]
How did it come to this?
I think about you all the time
It's no excuse, but I wish
That I never made you cry
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Ashley Clark with Carrie Underwood]
I'm not sorry that it's over
But for the way we let it end
I couldn't find the words to say

[Chorus: Carrie Underwood, Ashley Clark, Both]
And you should know, please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
But it's been so long, it's never easy
It's like trying to spin the world the other way
So what can I say? What can I say?
What can I say? What can I say?

[Verse 3: Carrie Underwood & Ashley Clark]
I hate to think all you had of me
(I said all I had to say)
Is a memory I left you
The space between what was meant to be
(In letters that I threw away)
And the mess that it turned into

[Chorus: Carrie Underwood, Ashley Clark, Both]
And you should know, please believe me
I've picked up the phone a thousand times
And tried to dial your number
But it's been so long, it's never easy
It's like trying to spin the world the other way
It is like trying to spin the world the other way
What can I say?
What can I say?
What can I say?
