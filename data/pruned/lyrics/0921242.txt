Days just throwing long
Thought i was doing alright alone
And then i saw your smile
Then you looked my way
Everything changed

And i
Don't know how i got by
How i survived life living without you
No, now i. . .i was missing
'cause i wanted to kiss you
Since the day that i found you
Now everything make sense to me
I never knew that love could be
So sweet

Your love is taking me to a place
A place i wanna be
Get's better every breath i breathe
And let your love any ways
And follow me like right every day

Everytime we talk
Everytime we touch
Everytime i look in you r eyes
I see how luck i amYou might also like
