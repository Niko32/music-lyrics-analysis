And her flowers don't bloom no more
I killed the boy who refuted joy and no more life anymore
And will she bring me her gift of smile
Or will she go and steal my pen
I found the child who willed to be wild
And she's now my only friend

Gotta buy the sunshine
Gotta steal the wind
Gotta pay for all of your debts
Gotta give the sweetness
Gotta give the rain
Put me and the raven away
Again

Empty shine to demon wine
And her glass don't spill no more
I found the boy who refuted joy
And still no life anymore
She never brought me my gift of smile
And she go run away with my pen
I killed the child who willed to be wild
And she was my only friend

Gotta buy the sunshine
Gotta steal the wind
Gotta pay for all of your debts
Gotta give the sweetness
Gotta give the rain
Put me and the raven away
Again
You might also likeGive me strength
Be my stone
Hold me up now
Feed me my bone
Empty your pockets
Wilt in the flame
Are all of your things still the same
Smile

Gotta buy the sunshine
Gotta steal the wind
Gotta pay for all of your debts
Gotta give the sweetness
Gotta give the rain
Put me and the raven away
Again
