If she's where you like living
You won't feel at home with me
She tells you lies looking into your eyes
She laughs but you don't see
She knows just how to make you bow
And you fall down on your knees
How could such a man be crushed in her hand
I don't believe I see

[Chorus]
But if she's where you like living
You won't feel at home with me

[Verse 2]
I thought a man like you could plainly see
When it comes to loving you she's so different from me
Oh I tell no lies, look into my eyes
Love is all you see
Oh I don't know how to make you bow
And I never let you get down on your knees
I do all I can, I keep such a man
Oh, it's time to talk about me

[Chorus][x2]You might also like
