Wanna be down with the program
You know my steelo
I gets busy when I'm doing my thang

[Verse 1]
You say you want it
Girl, I don't really think you do
'Cause I know you ain't ready
For what I'm 'bout to put down on you
'Cause I don't play games
When it come to doing it, girl, I do my thing
Better ask somebody before you come to my party
Wanna be down

[Chorus]
Wanna be down with the program
You know my steelo
I gets busy when I'm doing my thang
(Better ask somebody, better ask somebody, baby, wanna be down)
Wanna be down with my program
You know my steelo
I gets busy when I'm doing my thang
(Come on, girl, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Come on in, sit down, baby
Take a load off your feet
You're gonna need a little rest, baby
Before you get down with me
'Cause I brings the pain
Make you scream and shout and make you call my name
Bet you want forget it
It's like a drug, you're gonna be addicted, ooh, ooh, ooh
You might also like[Chorus]
Wanna be down with the program (Oh yeah)
You know my steelo
I gets busy when I'm doing my thang
(Baby, I know you heard about me, mhm, you say you wanna be down)
Wanna be down with my program (That's what you tell me)
You know my steelo
I gets busy when I'm doing my thang
