Face down on the ground, you can't get up
Broke down by the shouts, you've had enough
Blacked out, backed up against the wall
So scared, you swear you've lost it all
Hang tight, hold tight, while the seas are off

[Pre-Hook]
If you're not afraid of the dark
It's easy to see
If you're not afraid of who you are
It's easy to be

[Hook]
When the world is black and twisted
Had the chance, but you know you missed it
It's okay, your heart will find a way (the way)
When the world is black and twisted
Had the chance, but you know you missed it
It's okay, your heart will find a way
'Cause it has night vision, night vision

[Verse 2]
You gotta wait out, lighthouse inside your chest
Yeah, show's up, backs you up when you got nothing left
