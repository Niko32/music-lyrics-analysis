Out of all the safe roads promised
We return to the one with no self-control
It's a fuel to the fire that should never burn
While everything around us is so dry
Oh, up in smoke we go (Up in smoke we go)
Oh, up in smoke we go (Up in smoke we go)
Oh, up in smoke

[Chorus]
I have no time girl
To play this game with you, with you
Oh, I have a queen
Why would I settle for a fucking maid?
Don't bring me back to this game

[Verse 2]
Before you get any ideas, clean yourself off
Oh, you get burned
How many others will it take to reach your goal?
You're never complete
But still, you can sit here and spread it time after time

[Chorus]
I have no time girl
To play this game with you, with you
Oh, I have a queen
Why would I settle for a fucking maid?
Don't bring me back to this game
You might also like[Breakdown]
Go preach your sorrows girl on someone else
My bet is it's gonna end with heartache
Spread your legs one time
Spread your legs two times
We both know this is pathetic

[Chorus]
I have no time girl
To play this game with you, with you
Oh, I have a queen
Why would I settle for a fucking maid?
Don't bring me back to this game

[Post-Chorus]
I have a queen
Why would I settle for a fucking maid?
Why would I settle for a fucking maid?
Don't bring me back to this game

[Outro]
This game, this game oh
This game, to this game, to this game
If you play with fire, you get burned
If you play with fire, you get burned
