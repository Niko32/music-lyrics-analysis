Tell me, darling, have I been away too long?
I was wrong to leave, but now I'm coming home
Have you missed me? I kind of hoped you would
And jokingly I ask, "Are you being good?"

[Chorus: Loretta Lynn]
I'm being good as lonely girl can be
And there's no other place on Earth I'd rather be
Than lying here beside him, Lord, how sweet love can be
I'm being good as lonely girl can be

[Verse 2: Conway Twitty]
It was just too much for me, I should have known
You were just too much a woman to leave alone
I just realized I love you much too late
And, Lord, it's killing me to hear you say

[Chorus: Loretta Lynn & Conway Twitty]
I'm being good as lonely girl can be (Tell me, darling, have I been away too long?)
And there's no other place on Earth I'd rather be (I know I was wrong to leave, but now all I wanna do is come back home)
Than lying here beside him, Lord, how sweet love can be (It was just too much to me, I know I should've known)
I'm being good as lonely girl can be (You were just too much woman for me to leave alone)You might also like
