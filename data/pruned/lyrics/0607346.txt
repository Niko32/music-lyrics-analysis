Millicent, don't blame yourself
Sweetheart, there's no one else
More important to me than you

[Chorus]
There's nothing that you need to do
To prove to me that you care
I know you do

[Verse 2]
Millicent, just let 'em talk
'Cause this thing, it's a lock
And no one's gonna make that untrue

[Chorus]
There's nothing anyone can do
To change the way I feel about you
And you know that's true

[Verse 3]
Millicent, just lean on me
I know that I can be
Everything you need me to be

[Chorus]
There's no wall that I can't crash through
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
For you
You might also like[Outro]
Millicent, don't blame yourself
Sweetheart, there's no one else in the world
