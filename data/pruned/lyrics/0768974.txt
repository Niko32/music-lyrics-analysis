Rain is clean and new
New is the morning and morning dew
Wet is a kiss that touches you
Wet is sea
Sea is mysterious blue
Blue is for sadness and sad is for crying
Tears are wet too

Would you share these things with me
Dance in the rain, drift with the sea
And let the tears fall as they wade
Sometimes

I'm not afraid of melt in the rain
I'm not afraid to be lost at sea
I'm not afraid to cry again
Because it's tears of joy
You bring to me

Would you share these things with me
Dance in the rain, drift with the sea
And let the tears fall as they wade
Sometimes

Wet is love
Love that's flowing free
Free is the feeling I feel deep inside me
Come and see that wet is meYou might also like
