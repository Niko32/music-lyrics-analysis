So serious, all the time
I feel restrained, I feel confined
I cannot take your whispering, your whispering

[Chorus]
I wanna dance without you (Dance without you)
For once, just let me lose myself (Lose myself)
I wanna dance without you (Dance without you)
For once, just let me lose myself
For once, let me lose myself

[Verse 2]
So insecure, so uptight
I break my neck, to be polite
I cannot take your whispering, your whispering

[Chorus]
I wanna dance without you (Dance without you)
For once, just let me lose myself (Lose myself)
I wanna dance without you (Dance without you)
For once, just let me lose myself
For once, let me lose myself

[Bridge]
How can I make history, with your choreography?
Take your hands off me
Take your hands off me
Before I suffocate
You might also like[Chorus]
I wanna dance without you (Dance without you)
For once, just let me lose myself (Lose myself)
I wanna dance without you (Dance without you)
For once, just let me lose myself
For once, let me lose myself
