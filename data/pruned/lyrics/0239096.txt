Wakin' up to a dream
Nothin' but the brights on
Catchin' laser beams
I can hear the bright lights
Callin' me
Stars in my head
Are all I can see

At night when I close my eyes
All I dream of are lights, are lights, are lights, are lights
At night when I close my eyes
All I dream of are lights, are lights, are lights, are lights
At night when I close my eyes
All I dream of are lights, are lights, are lights, are lights
At night when I close my eyes
All I dream of are lights, are lights, are lights, are lights

Technicolor hazin'
Pulled up in a cloud
The shit we do's amazin'
See the spectrum loud
Infinity in pieces
Everybody wanna taste
Turnin' trials into neon
Watch 'em illuminate
