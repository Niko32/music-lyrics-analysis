Long day so I'm kicking back and I grab my favorite coffee mug
Sitting down with a bottle of stars, pour myself a cup of the Milky Way
Quarks and atoms, carbon and models, swirl it up, let the galaxy breathe
Big bang now in the morning, lights flash 'round like it is Christmas Eve
After the first sip I set the cup down, it sank into the table top
Wondering why the force broke pine, cup skewered out just like a shish-kebab
Luminous electromagnetic and gravitational forces
Began to form the ceramic into a black hole
Everything inside my apartment including dishes and garbage
Began to slide across the floor like I lost control
Vision turns to redshift, wavelengths increase distance
As I'm pulled in the blackness
My extremities become rivers of noise as I cascade galactic everglades
Fingertips touch the top of the spectrum
All hate leaves, there is no violence, only violet
There is no silence, only diamonds
Push-pinned into a black canvas
Lost all thoughts and all my balance
Dropped my face like a filthy habit
Deoxyribonucleic acid began to pour out

[Verse 2]
Spall erupts as the radiation of a thousand suns enter my body
Or what's left of it, I no longer have skin, I got quantum foam
Unlike my thoughts, they're so small that they're never shown
Space has no walls but I feel at home, lights flash beside my ethereal eyelids
I think I'm God but looking back I see Osiris
I see slaves building and killing and Constantine and the willing
The Renaissance and the filling of every womb on the planet
At once like I must have planned it, I see the trees that are planted
Grandiose technology mixed with classical mythology
Kids playing games in a hotel lobby, kids grow up and lay down in the bedrock
And then it stopped

Open up your eyes and let the old one die (x3)
Just let the old one die
Just let the old one die

[Verse 3]
My spine splits like string cheese being eaten and I cease to breathe
Tenderly released from bodily prison
Ignite a firestorm of light and steam
Stars whirl and never stay in the same place, arms curl and pretty soon they're erased
Leaving nothing but the soul in deep space
Twenty-thousand years and everything's a clean slate
I reach the end of the line, destroy concept of time
Look down and to my surprise: my arm is dark matter
I begin to realize that I'm no longer alive
And time flies past my eyes like I'm stuck in a turbine
10,000 lives and each one's as spontaneous as the last
I'm at the restaurant at the end of it with one sip in my glass
The waiters compress into bottles of space wine
I smell burnt steak, iron metal, and aged pine
Who knew I'd see math at the Big Crunch while I wine and dine?
My body divides into a line and two circles and I'm tasting purple
Jump through a portal, conceptually immortal
The dinosaurs dance as I run through the hour circle

[Instrumental section]
[Verse 4]
Buildings pop horizons like hair through epidermis
And enormous heat from cores blast me like a gas furnace
My skin folds over my lips and eyes, atoms start shifting and I
Sit back inside of my kitchen into my current life
Same clothes, same hair, same coffee cup that's empty
Only thing that's different is Orion's Belt that's been burned on me
Traveled the universe and gathered information and a presence omni
Only thing I have to prove it are three freckles that space kissed on me
I won't know what tomorrow will bring, but I do know how the past will seem
In line for the inside dream, wait 'til the fat lady sings
There's no need to go to bed with one sip left in my cup
I'll lean back in my chair and let my galaxy erupt
