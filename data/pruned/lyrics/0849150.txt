Frozen tongues screaming for the light
A whisper on my breath
My faith is out of sight, forever
Forever is what we were told
But the oath is withered

The vows are all broken
And cursed is my name
I hear yours spoken
I share in this shame

We are mourning, with our souls relieved
Now victim, the beast that time unleashed
We are mourning, with our souls bereaved
We are fallen, the beast that time unleashed

In the passion for the flame
The winds of doubt, they came
Frozen tongues screaming for the light
And this memory was slain
Forever is what we were told
But the oath is withered

The vows are all broken, and cursed is my name
I hear yours spoken, I share in this shame
We are mourning, with our souls bereaved
We are fallen, the beast that time unleashedYou might also like
