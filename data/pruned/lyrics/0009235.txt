[Chorus 1][All]
We don't need no more trouble
We don't need no more trouble

[Verse 1][Erykah]
What we need is love (love)
To guide and protect us all (all)
If you hope good down from above (love)
Help the weak if you are strong now (strong)

[Chorus 2][Bob]
We don't need no trouble
What we need is love

[Chorus 1][All]

[Verse 2][Erykah]
Weeping for the living
Weeping for the dead
Weep for one another
Weep for happiness
Weeping for the struggle
Weeping for the pain
Weeping for the children
We must take the blame
You might also like[Bob]
Seek happiness
(It's sad enough without your foes)
Come on, you all and speak of love
(It's sad enough without your foes)
We don't need no trouble
What we need is love now
(What we need is love, sweet love)

[Chorus 1][All]

[Verse 3][Erykah]
Now end the war which you just begun
It's sad enough without your foes
I thought I told you not to mess with me
Don't want no trouble but trouble found me
But Marley saying speak of love not war
But we be trying but then eh we don't

[Chorus 2][x2][Bob]

[Chorus 1][All]
