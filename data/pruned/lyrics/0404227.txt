I'm in love
With you

There's an ocean between us
Just like me
Deep and Blue

And I, at times have had nothing
But tonight I want nothing but you
You're the only thing I want
The only thing I want
The only thing on my mind
All the time

Staying up 'til dawn won't take its toll
'Til we get old
And drinking is just the way
We keep away the cold
And you, you know what it means
To be true and searching like me

You're the only thing I need
The only thing I need
The only thing on my mind
All the time
You might also likeAnd you gave me a reason
To give you my soul
I'll give you it all

You're the only one I want
The only one I need
The only one on my mind
All the time
All the time
All the time
All the time
