Jesus, keep me near the cross
There a precious fountain-
Free to all, a healing stream-
Flows from Calvary's mountain

[Chorus]
In the cross, in the cross
Be my glory ever
Till my raptured soul shall find
Rest beyond the river

[Verse 2]
Near the cross, a trembling soul
Love and Mercy found me
There the bright and morning star
Sheds its beams around me

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Near the cross, O Lamb of God
Bring its scenes before me
Help me walk from day to day
With its shadows o'er me
You might also like[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Near the cross I'll watch and wait
Hoping, trusting ever
Till the golden strand I reach
Just beyond the river

[Chorus]
