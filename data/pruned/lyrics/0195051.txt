No attorneys to plead my case
No opiates to send me into outer space
And my fingers are bejeweled
With diamonds and gold
But that ain't gonna help me now

[Chorus]
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I disturb my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you're right
But you were wrong
You tried to take me
But I knew all along
You can take me
For a ride
I'm not a fool out
So you better run and hide
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town

[Verse]
If you see me comin'
Down the street
Then you know it's time to
Go (And you know it's time to go, 'cause here comes trouble)

[Refrain]
No attorneys to plead my case
No opiates to send me into outer space
And my fingers are bejeweled
With diamonds and gold
But that ain't gonna help me now

[Pre-Chorus]
You think you're right
But you were wrong
You tried to take me
But I knew all along
You can take me
For a ride
Cause I'm not a fool out
So you better run and hide
[Chorus]
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I disturb my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town

[Verse]
So if you see me comin'
Down the street
Then you know it's time to
Go (Go-oh-oh, I got)

[Chorus]
Trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town
I'm trouble
Yeah, trouble now
I'm trouble y'all
I got trouble in my town
Yeah, yeah
I got trouble in my town
Yeah, yeah
[Outro]
I got trouble in my town
Yeah, yeah
