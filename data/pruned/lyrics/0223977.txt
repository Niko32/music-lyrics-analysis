I guess it's cause and effect
Your heart and mine
The way that we connect
Keeps blowing my mind
There you go again, it never ends
What you do to me

[Chorus]
That I have seen the light of day
Love is finally going my way
Is it too good to be true? (Too good to be true)
Give me one more kiss, one more touch
Baby, I just can't get enough of you
This time, too good is true

[Verse 2]
All of a sudden, I'm not who I used to be
I had my heart locked, but you held the key
And you find a way, every day
To show me even more

[Chorus]
That I have seen the light of day
Love is finally going my way
Is it too good to be true? (Too good to be true)
Give me one more kiss, one more touch
Baby, I just can't get enough of you
This time, too good is true
You might also like[Bridge]
Some people say we're too good to be true (Too good to be true)
But they don't get to be loved by you

[Chorus]
That I have seen the light of day
Love is finally going my way
Is it too good to be true? (Too good to be true)
Give me one more kiss, one more touch
Baby, I just can't get enough of you
This time, too good is true

[Outro]
Oh, this time, too good is true
Yes it is, yeah
