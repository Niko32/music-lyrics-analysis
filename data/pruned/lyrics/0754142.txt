Glory glory clear the road
I'm tired of totin this heavy load
Old St Peter I'm a running late
Can't you get that key and unlock the gate

[Verse 1: Big Chief]
Once I heard a preacher man
Preachin' 'bout that promised land
How it flowed with sparkling wine
Luscious fruit hung on the vine
Not a worry, not a care
All is peace and no despair
For on that day I had aspired
To reach that land that's so desired

[Chorus]

[Verse 2: Big Chief]
Then He preached about that place
That's reserved for fallen race
And damnation for the stray
That would come along the way
There is Devil is a-waitin by a might lake of fire
All the rest you know so well
Only flame they call it Hell
You might also like[Chorus]

[Bridge]
[Jake Hess]
I'm gonna preach now (oh yeah)
I'm gonna tell you how (oh yeah)
How you can get upstairs (oh yeah)
How you can reach that city so bright and fair
You gotta live right (oh yeah)
You gotta pray each night (oh yeah)
Down on your bended knee (oh yeah)
You gotta trust in God He'll make you free
Up in the good land (oh yeah)
Where all the righteous stand (oh yeah)
I'm gonna see His face (oh yeah)
He's gonna say "My child you've run the race"

[Denver Crumpler]
Beauty so rare, (oh yeah)
It's beyond compare (oh yeah)
You'll never know a care (oh yeah)
Up on the golden streets so bright and fair
Then you'll be shouting
Glory, glory glory clear the road
