Close to home
Far from me
I thought I lost my goddamn mind
Trying to be all that you want me to be
And now you're gone, gone, gone
You won't look at me
Kodachrome is how I see
All the world's in black and white, red, blue, and green
The moments locked up in our machine
And now they're gone, gone, gone
Oh, they're gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
From my memory

[Kimbra] (Hidden Track)
Wake up in his, we rose a toast to the rest
Nobody cares if I let it in
Who knows what’s staying under my skin
Pinning me

Don’t go, don’t (world’s mad)
No one can understand
How to spend the best found love
It withstood heaven and hellYou might also like
