I ain't tryna be rude, dude
But we tryna tear up the place, come on

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake, Timbaland]
Hey, Timbo? (Yeah?)
Don't you hate it when a dude starts actin' up
Like this fella over here with his hand on his cup
Mean muggin' and carryin' on?
Hey, JT? (Yeah?)
Why these dudes keep starin' at us?
I don't know, but I'm 'bout to find out what's up
Be easy, don't take it too rough
Talk to 'em

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Timbaland]
I'm not bein' cocky
I just noticed that she was lookin' at me
Chill, homeboy, be cool
'Cause there ain't no reason for all that fussin' at me
It's just gettin' started
And there's a lotta fish around here, just shakin' their jelly
I ain't tryna be rude, dude
But we tryna tear up the place, come on

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It ain't nothin' to it
If you wanna get down then we can do it, do it
It ain't nothin' to it
Get out your seat (why?), you ain't glued to it
Be easy and watch that tone
Keep steppin' with your new suede shoes on
Boys and girls, let's all sing along
Everybody just get on the good foot
[Break: Justin Timberlake, Timbaland]
(What you need to do is get-)
Get on the good foot
(What you need to do, frk-ow-ow-ow)

[Verse 2: Justin Timberlake, Timbaland]
Now, how am I supposed to know that she's yours?
She ain't got no ring on her finger
It ain't our fault, homeboy
That your girl likes the wander and linger
And your actin' so serious
We just danced, I ain't even ask for her number
Don't be mad 'cause we the life of the party
We ain't really tryna hurt nobody
Talk to 'em

[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Timbaland]
I'm not bein' cocky
I just noticed that she was lookin' at me
Chill, homeboy, be cool
'Cause there ain't no reason for all that fussin' at me
It's just gettin' started
And there's a lotta fish around here, just shakin' their jelly
I ain't tryna be rude, dude
But we tryna tear up the place, come on
[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It ain't nothin' to it
If you wanna get down then we can do it, do it
It ain't nothin' to it
Get out your seat (why?), you ain't glued to it
Be easy and watch that tone
Keep steppin' with your new suede shoes on
Boys and girls, let's all sing along
Everybody just get on the good foot

[Interlude: Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
Oh no
(And just) Get on the good foot
Oh no
(And let her) Get on the good foot

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
If you keep on pressin' at me
(That don't bother me none)
'Cause I see every fish in the sea
(I'mma kiss the baddest one)
You take yourself so seriously
(But you don't impress me none)
Don't be alarmed, boy
We came to do no harm, boy
Talk to 'em
[Pre-Chorus: Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake & Timbaland]
I'm not bein' cocky
I just noticed that she was lookin' at me
Chill, homeboy, be cool
'Cause there ain't no reason for all that fussin' at me
It's just gettin' started
And there's a lotta fish around here, just shakin' their jelly
I ain't tryna be rude, dude
But we tryna tear up the place, come on

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
It ain't nothin' to it
If you wanna get down then we can do it, do it
It ain't nothin' to it
Get out your seat (why?), you ain't glued to it
Be easy and watch that tone
Keep steppin' with your new suede shoes on
Boys and girls, let's all sing along
Everybody just get on the good foot

[Outro: Justin Timberlake & Timbaland, Timbaland, Justin Timberlake]
(Girl) Get on the good foot
(Hey, slow down, boy)
Get on the good foot
(Oh) Yeah
(Oh) Yeah
