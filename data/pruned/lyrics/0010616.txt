Be alive now
Let me open the door
Let the music captivate and make the voices still
And
See the light
See the lotus flower
Spinnin' around within
Opening up new worlds to explore
Ay Ay Ay Ay

[Repeat]
[Repeat]

[Verse One]
Here we go ridin' on waves
See the lotus
Creepin' up without a notice
Make a foe spaz
Dwellin' in a zone that's so rare
Really no man
Be up in or try to go there
Outta your head
Flyin' through the sky on mopeds
Yellin' oh yeah
Cosmic universal showcase
I'm a go head
Shoot the gift at y'all
With no lead
Get you open
Runnin' around the rings of Saturn
And some Pro Keds
Screamin'

[Bridge: George Clinton]
Ain't nothin' wrong with you
Do not adjust your channel
Keep movin' on won't you
We've just began to travel

[Verse Two]
Stylin' infinite and passion
Make me mash on
Till the last song's done
So fasten
Your belt and let's run
Through intersessions
You're probably stressin'
I didn't come to rhyme about
Using a Smith and Wesson
We test understanding
Lessons
That come from down and under
Where sons haven't been born
At my discretion
I'm here to bless ya
Apply the pressure
To get ya
Aligned with mind and body
Party
Syncing
With the bigger picture
You may not get it now
But in the future
You will mature
And join the Craft
And outer [?]
If the music lets ya
It's just the essence
Of pure common sense
It's not a lecture
If you don't make it in this life
I'll see your spirit
Next time
Singin'
[Hook]

[Bridge: George Clinton]
Just let the song take you
To places where the magic
Is going on people
I know you've got to have it
