Why are you so arrogant?
(th....Th...There he is!)
(th....There he is!)
(th....Th...There he is!)

[Verse 1: Prince]
What makes a man wanna rule the world?
(A-double-a-double arrogance)
(You got it)
Make him man enough to say he's 50-50 girl
(A-double-a-double arrogance)
(You got it)
What makes a man wanna curse and swear?
(A-double-a-double arrogance)
(You got it)
Then blame it on heaven 'cause he's already there

[Refrain: Prince]
Pimprag, tootsie pop, and a cane

[Verse 2: Prince]
What makes a man wanna play guitar?
(A-double-a-double arrogance)
(You got it)
Same thing that makes him wanna be a star
(A-double-a-double arrogance)
(You got it)
What makes him wanna see his name in lights?
(A-double-a-double arrogance)
(You got it)
...It was the same thing that made Eve take the first bite

[Outro: Prince and Kirstie Alley]
(Don't make me get up)
(There he is, get him)
(Don't make me get up)
Like a flame she came and I was no longer cold
That's a little shady, for this lady was only sixteen years old
