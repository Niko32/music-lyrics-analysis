I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
Falling down

[Verse 1]
I got this panic emotion that I cannot describe to you
My world is tumbelling down what am I, what am I gonna do
Ca-can't deny it, deny it, what am I going through
Ca-can not fight it, can fight it, now I'm looking for the truth

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna live a lie / Checking on my sanity
'Cause maybe baby I can do without / Is it all a fantasy?
I don't wanna live a lie / Is this my reality?
It's spinning round and round day and night

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one
Falling down

I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one
Falling down

I'm on a critical mission, got my destiny in my hands
Like Peter Piper I take control put a spell on the mass
I cause hysteria, worry yourself, that's how I roll
It's not a drill, I'm for real, I'm a man who's out of control

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna live a lie / Checking on my sanity
'Cause maybe baby I can do without / Is it all a fantasy?
I don't wanna live a lie / Is this my reality?
It's spinning round and round day and night

[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one
Falling down

I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one
Falling down

[Bridge]
I'm falling, I'm falling
And I just can't believe it
I'm falling, I'm falling down
[Chorus]
I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one
Falling down

I don't wanna lose control, but I'm falling
I just can't believe it
Never thought that I would be the one
Falling down
