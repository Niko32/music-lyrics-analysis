After midnight
Out in the moonlight
Just like we used to do
I'm always walkin'
After midnight
Searching for you
I walk for miles
Along the highway
Well that's just my way of saying I love you
I'm always walkin'
After midnight
Searching for you
I stopped to see a weeping willow
Cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be
I go out walkin'
After midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hoping you may be
Somewhere walkin'
After midnight
Searching for me
I stopped to see a weeping willow
Crying on his pillow
Maybe he's crying for me
And as the skies turn gloomy
Night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be
I'm out walkin'
After midnight
Out in the starlight
Just hoping you may be
Somewhere walkin'
After midnight
