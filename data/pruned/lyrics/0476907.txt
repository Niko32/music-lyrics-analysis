You cry the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river
You look and cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cry over you
You drove, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shared a tear
I remember, remember all that you said
You told me you were too busy
And don't have no time for me
Now you say you love me
Well, just to prove that you do
Cry me a river, cry me a river
I cry a river over you
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear, oh
I remember, I remember all you said
You told me you were too busy and said you don't have time, no
You said, say you love me!
And just to prove that you do
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cry a river over you
Say you love, say you'll love all
You were too busy and you don't have no time for me
And now you say
Baby, you just can't do around me
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cry a river over you
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cry a river over you, over and over
Over and over, over
I cry a river over youYou might also like
