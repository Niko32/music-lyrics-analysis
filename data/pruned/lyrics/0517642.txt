All the arguing and fighting
And now you won’t even call back
I’ll just keep ringing though
I hope I can get through to you
But if not, I’m just gonna keep drinking
Even though its 4AM

I’m sitting here faded
Waiting on you
I know that it’s crazy
Cuz I, shouldn’t have too

But all I got
Is a drink in my hand
Henny and ciroc
And I don’t understand
All this time I’ve wasted
I drank all these bottles I’m faded

I don’t need to smoke, to get high, for you
I don’t need drink, to know, i’m drunk in love

Cuz i’m faded, faded, faded, faded for you
Cuz i’m faded, faded, faded, faded for you

Faded, I think the drink got to my head
4AM, 4AM
I waited, but theres no one in my bed
It’s 4AM, 4AM
Oh I’m faded
4AM, 4AM
I wish I, could take back what I said

Cuz now you’re gone girl
I wish you would call me right back
I’m getting though to voicemail
I didn’t mean to treat you like that

But all I got
Is a drink in my hand
Henny and ciroc
And I don’t understand
All this time I’ve wasted
I drank all these bottles I’m faded

I don’t need to smoke, to get high, for you
I don’t need drink, to know, i’m drunk in love

Cuz i’m faded, faded, faded, faded for you
Cuz i’m faded, faded, faded, faded for you
Now it’s 4AM, 4AM
Faded, I think the drink got to my head
4AM, 4AM
I waited, but theres no one in my bed
It’s 4AM, 4AM
Oh I’m faded
4AM, 4AM
I wish I, could take back what I said
