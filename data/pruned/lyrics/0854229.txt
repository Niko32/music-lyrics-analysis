And I don't care about the way you feel inside
You say the weight's all on your shoulders
Baby you say I never tried

But I tried runnin' from the way I feel about you
And I tried walkin' away from all the lies
I tried leavin' but I couldn't live without you
And I never said goodbye
But baby I tried

We judge ourselves by our intentions
And others by the way they live their lives
I always meant to do the right thing
How can you say that I never tried
'cause

But I tried runnin' from the way I feel about you
And I tried walkin' away from all the lies
I tried leavin' but I couldn't live without you
And I never said goodbye
But baby I tried

Baby I tried

Whatever it is about you
Keeps pullin' me back into your web
I can't put my finger on it
Whatever it is I ain't figured it out yet
