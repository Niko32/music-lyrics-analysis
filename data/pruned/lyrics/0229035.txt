I remember my grandfather's counsel
As he layed the leather to my hide
He said there's just one rule to life that always will apply
You can't do wrong and get by
(Ricky)
Now, lessons tend to fade as we grow older
And I found myself in jail at twenty-five
Had to sit there by my lawyer, the old judge looked me in the eye
Said, you can't do wrong and get by
(Both)
You can't do wrong and get by for very long
Do wrong and all your troubles multiply
(George)
You may not face them here but you'll face the man on high
(Both)
You can't do wrong and get by

Now once I had a wife and lovin' children
But I gave into the pleasures of the night
Used my grand dads very words to say her last goodbye
You can't do wrong and get by
(Both)
You can't do wrong and get by for very long
Do wrong and all your troubles multiply
(Ricky)
Oh, you may not face them here but you'll sure face the man on high
(Both)
You can't do wrong and get by
No, no, you can't do wrong and get by
You can't do wrong and get by
Oh no, you can't do wrong and get by...You might also like
