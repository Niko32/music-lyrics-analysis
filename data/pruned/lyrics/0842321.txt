Mighta wandered here from far
No matter where you come from
No matter who you are

You need no ID
You need no membership cards
Don't you know you're always welcome
In my Father's house

Could be a child of the streets
Could be rich man's son
No matter what you're doin'
No matter whatcha done

When you got no place to hide
No place left to run
Don't you know there's always shelter
In my Father's house

When you're lonely an' discouraged
An' misery just won't end
When you need that helpin' hand
An' no-one wants to lend

When you're down on your knees
Waiting for a friend
Don't you know you surely find one
In my Father's house
You might also likeWhen you're mistreated in this world
Like a stranger in a strange land
When the chains around your heart
Are just too much to stand

When heaven's just a word
An' hell is close at hand
Come lay your burden down
In my Father's house
In my Father's house
Ah, in my Father's house
Oh, in my Father's house
Hey, in my Father's house
Whoo, in my Father's house
Ooh, in my Father's house
Ooh, in my Father's house
