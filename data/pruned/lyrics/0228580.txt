Jesus said he would return and I believe he's on his way
You better change your way of livin' I hope your soul is saved
If you want to go with Jesus on that judgement day
When Gabriel makes his trumpet sound what beautiful sight
I hope your name is written down in the book of life
If you don't have salvation and you've never learned to pray
You can't go with Jesus on that judgement day
When Jesus comes to take his children home sweet home
To beautiful mansion in the sweet by and by
We'll cross the Jordan river singin' a song
When Jesus comes to take his children home
When Jesus comes to take his children home sweet home
To beautiful mansion in the sweet by and by
We'll cross the Jordan river singin' a song
When Jesus comes to take his children home
When Jesus comes to take his children home...You might also like
