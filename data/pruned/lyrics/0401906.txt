Lights, camera, and action
Mo' money, mo' problems
Got more bitches, need more condoms
Nigga, we active; topping them bottles
Kenny collecting them dividends
Preach! Preach! Like reverends
Party-arty with the best of them
We only fuck bitches, she celibate
Gold bezels make a nigga want to rob me
Keep a bad bitch beside me
Don't watch me, nigga try to clock my flow
Fuck a few white freak hoes
They know about Rebel, nigga put the petal to the metal
Bitch I might grip that metal!
Glyn Brown, whats the problem!?
Cuz I robbed him, niggas be asking "who shot him?"
Man! That brother Rebel so jiggy HUH
Hippies giving me hickies
Got a bad bitch in Mississippi
Pull out my dick and now she sipping
That young nigga so famous and all my rebels be dangerous
Gold locks up on my pavement
Yeah we keep them bangers distinguished HUH

[Interlude]
This that RebeLife dawg
This that shit that niggas wish for, that niggas would kill for
Niggas go by one motive and we stay by the motive

Lights, camera, and action
Mo' money, mo' problems
Got more bitches, need more condoms
Nigga, we active; topping them bottles
Fuck a bottle, nigga
I'd rather have a bitch top me
Gripping me, Kawasaki
Versace, nigga got to rock that shit
Fuck a few white freak chicks
They know about Kenny but Kenny don't know them hoes
Smokes while she blows them, oh!
She blow that dick, talking about "Fuck real quick?"
Kenny just contradict
I want that money, power, respect
My electronic prospect
Give me all that best connects
Now these hoes all neglected, get paper
Now we got the free, know what I mean?
Kenny be living off schemes
Hoes enticed by the Gs, enticed by the gold
Living the life of a dream HUH

[Outro]
We rebel against life, rebel against everything that goes on in society, yeah
It's more than a name, it's what we live by
Like I said this shit is a motive
