Summer night city
Summer night city
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city

[Verse 1: Agnetha & Frida]
In the sun I feel like sleeping
I can't take it for too long
My impatience slowly creeping
Up my spine and growing strong

[Pre-Chorus: Björn, Agnetha, Benny & Frida]

I love the feeling in the air
My kind of people everywhere

When the night comes with the action
I just know it's time to go
Can't resist the strange attraction
From that giant dynamo
And tomorrow, when it's dawning
And the first birds start to sing
In the pale light of the morning
Nothing's worth remembering
It's a dream, it's out of reach
Scattered driftwood on the beach
[Refrain: Björn, Agnetha, Benny & Frida]
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
Summer night city
Walking in the moonlight, love-making in a park
Summer night city
Waiting for the sunrise, soul dancing in the dark
