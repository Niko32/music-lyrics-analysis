Come on, little boy, I am your friend
And I understand the pain you're in
You've seen your mom come, come home dreaming
In the rain, when you wash, you can't fade it

[Chorus 1]
Come on, little boy
You don't need to cry
You don't need to cry your eyes out
Cry your eyes out

[Chorus 2]
Come on, kid
Keep your head up and sigh
You don't need to understand
The reasons why

[Outro]
Oh why, oh why, oh why, oh
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh
Why, oh why, oh why, oh why, oh
