Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Party
This is the life of the..
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 1: GnX]
Woke up, 6 pm and I'm yawning
Head spinning, damn, what's the story?
Might have took a couple of shots, all on me
Text from my girl, last night she was lonely
This is the life of the party
Think I might do it again, no prolly
A few calls to the homies, like what it do?
Light it up, we the fuse, get it understood
Fine shorties, long shoes, and short skirts
All over, like fake niggas and long shots
We in the whip, riding like we got no plot
Heading to the VIP, reserved like four slots
Uh, now we taking in no suggestions
Put in a lot of work so to party is a blessing
Yeah, we living life on another lane
Hands in the air, let's sway

[Chorus: GnX]
This is how life is supposed to be x2
Get the liquor, do you smoke? x2

I'm on the floor, doing my sway
Swag up, turned up, cause that's how I play
And so I met this young shorty, by the name May
Got my shades on, so I never see her like day
They say I party a little too much, and I tell em I'm stopping but that just a bluff
My mind always says that enough is enough
But the life of the party just tells me I'm tough
Bodies in motion, little commotion
Took bottles of that liquor, bring out emotions
Puffing on that cloud and I call it locomotion
I could've gone a little deeper, like I'm the ocean
Uh, now we party in all directions
Put a lot into it now we looking for perfection
Living life on another lane
Party like I been paid

[Chorus: GnX]

[Bridge: GnX]
Yeah, life of the party
PlayMakr, life of the party
Kevin Grands

[Chorus: GnX]
