Tryin' to just get on with my life
And this time next year hope I'm through with the hurting
Tryin' to get you out of my mind
So, don't try to play like you're not that concerned
And don't try to say that your heart doesn't burn
Oh, tell me
How can you say that our love isn't special?
How can you say that our love wasn't true?
And how can you say you can take it or leave it
(Leave it)
When I'm missing you
And you know, you'll be missing me, too?
This time next year, I'll be out buying presents
And something will remind me of you, yeah, yeah
And this time next year, I'll be out having dinner
And run into some friends we both knew, yeah, yeah
Oh, don't try to play like you won't be concerned
And don't try to say that your heart doesn't yearn
Oh, tell me
How can you say that our love isn't special?
How can you say that our love wasn't true?
And how can you say you can take it or leave it
(Leave it)
When I'm missing you
And you know, you'll be missing me, too?
Come early Christmas morning
I'll be having my coffee and I'll think of you
And the things we used to do, ooh
And you know, it will be breaking my heart
'Cause the holidays are special
It will always play a part in my heart
Tell me
(How can you say?)
How can you do it, baby?
(How can you say?)
How can you say our love ain't true?
(How can you say?)
You can take it or leave it
(Leave it)
When I'm missing you
And you know, you'll be missing
Tell me
(How can you say?)
How can you say baby our love ain't special?
(How can you say?)
Tell me, how you say our love ain't true?
(How can you say?)
You can take it or leave it
(Leave it)
When I'm missing you
And you know, you'll be missing
When I'm missing you
And you know, you'll be missing, baby yeah

And you know
(You'll be missing)
