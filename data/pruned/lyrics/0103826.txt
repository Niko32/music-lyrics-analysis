Hit me hard with the lips on me
Caught me so off guard red like roses
And my friends saw our first kiss, oh

[Verse 1]
Fell so deep, everybody noticed
Though I try to resist
(Baby you are, baby you are)
Ever since I met you what I think of love has changed
Made me question my perception, everything was rearranged
And I try to fight it, I don't wanna put you through no pain
When I tell you that I need a man again

[Chorus]
Guess that, I'm selfish, I'm sorry
Can't help it need that body
Won't be here forever
Come get it now or never

[Post-Chorus]
(Hit me hard)
(Oh, yeah!)

[Verse 2]
Girl you're like a summer in the midst of all the rain
Since the day I got your number, you been running 'round my brain
And I try to fight it, I don't wanna put you through no pain
And I'll tell you that I need a man again, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm selfish, I'm sorry
Can't help it need that body
Won't be here forever
Come get it now

[Outro]
Put your lips on me
Caught me so off guard
And my friends saw our first kiss
