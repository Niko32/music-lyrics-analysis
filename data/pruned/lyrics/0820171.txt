[Verse 1]
She floats like a swan
Grace on the water
Lips like sugar, lips like sugar
Just when you think you've caught her
She glides across the water
She calls for you tonight
To share this moonlight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You'll flow down her river
She'll ask and you'll give her

[Chorus]
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
She knows what she knows
I know what she's thinking
Sugar kisses, sugar kisses
Just when you think she's yours
She's flown to other shores
To laugh at how you break
And melt into this lake
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
You'll flow down her river
But you'll never give her

[Chorus]
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
She'll be my mirror
Reflect what I am
A loser and a winner
The king of Siam
And my Siamese twin
Alone on the river
Mirror kisses, mirror kisses

[Chorus]
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
[Chorus]
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

[Chorus]
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses
Lips like sugar
Sugar kisses

[Instrumental Outro]
