Tank tops, short shorts and sundresses
Walking down the block like word rapper want test this
Back up on the guest list, stack up all the checks thick
Mack up on the next chick and catch up on some rest quick
Blunts all June, cheeba in July
All my boys turned to dealers cause it's cheaper to supply
For most of August I'm close to raucous
Ignorant rapper, I'm supposed to talk shit
Ma, I think we're supposed to lock lips
Might be destiny, where you get the best of me
Sex for free, baby I would like to see
Section B. Who's the best? You should mention me
Ready to fuck, why I act that way
She whispered in my ear that she want to take the back way
So instead of make her unsuck the dick up
I'll lick the clit up and see her come out my mouth like a hiccup

[Hook]
Summer, summertime, summertime fling
Summer, summertime, let's do our summertime thing
(repeated)

[Verse 2: Big Baby Gandhi]
Panties on my tongue remind me chicken and broccoli
Hot summer day you got me thinking you jacking me
Show up at the crib, you start licking me sloppily
Before I'm brushing my teeth you're already touching your feet
Stretching out your calves, doing some jumping jacks
Pumpkin, it's best when you humping me back
Rough like you like it, fuck like you like dick
Don't give a fuck, make her buck like I'm quite rich
Mathematical, ask the golden ratio
That's fellatio, she say she so sensational
It's like you don't love yourself when you deep throat
Permission to land, pussy looking like Heathrow
I'm a freak though, hottie, you a freak too?
Someone to sleep with and somebody to speak to
Someone to go to the movies with
Ma, peek at your boobies quick

[Verse 3: Big Baby Gandhi]
Big Baby, Ma, I'm back on the block
Who want to act like I'm not, you can gag on the cock
You could suck on the balls, you could lick on the tip
You could sniff on that shit, get a whiff of this dick, ah?
Everything you like, Ma, you put up your nose
I put sperm up your nostril and I fuck up your clothes
Gandhi leave traces like he want to get caught
You won't see the marijuana he bought. It ain't a thing
Brown kid from Flushing, profound on percussion
Pound that I'm puffing make me sound like I'm fronting
Yeah, so let's have that discussion
The style is revolting, the swag is disgusting
Body bags is too much, kid
It's too much , kid
Why it always real in the hood?
I beg for it, but still I'm a thug
Mami

[Hook]

[Outro: Big Baby Gandhi]
So, uh, yeah, what you think?
Summertime fling, we do our summertime thing
You know, I even made a song about it
Nah, for real
Yo, we could even, we could go on a date, you know
Go to the park, you know, we could smoke some bud, take a little walk, get some icees
If you want we could go watch a movie, you know. Maybe, maybe you'd give me a handjob
Nah, nah, I'm just kidding, I'm just kidding
Yeah, we ain't got to get icees
