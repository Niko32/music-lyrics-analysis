I know about love
It don't grow on trees
When the stars shine on me
They shine sadly
I know about love

You talk about home
This is my home
There's no bricks, no stone
When the wind comes calling 'round
Who's to shelter me
Don't talk about home

And I don't know why
I'm standing on the outside and I'm looking in
And how hard I try to be there
Out of the dark and joining in
Let me in

Because Larry's gonna be there
Mary's gonna be there
Everyone will be there
Man I want to be there
Joe is gonna be there
Susan's gonna be there
Everyone will be there
So let me in
You might also likeYou talk about loss
I know about loss
I don't have much
But those who have more
Think that I've got enough
I know about loss

You talk about me
Enough about me
'Cause I'll disappear like a child in the crowd
You won't notice that I'm not here
So let's not talk about me

And I don't know why
I'm standing on the outside and I'm looking in
And how hard I try to be there
Out of the dark and joining in
Let me in

Because Sara's gonna be there
Mel is gonna be there
David's gonna be there
Ooh I gotta be there
Dorothy's gonna be there
Martin's gonna be there
Seymour's gonna be there
So let me in
Ann is gonna there
Vince is gonna be there
Tony's gonna be there
Man I want to be there
Pam is gonna be there
Jack is gonna be there
Everyone will be there
So let me in

And I don't know why
I'm standing on the outside, I'm looking in
And how hard I try to be there
Out of the dark and joining in
C'mon let me in

Because Becky's gonna be there
Billy's gonna be there
Carl is gonna be there
Man I want to be there
Bobby's gonna be there
Peter's gonna be there
Man I want to be there
C'mon and let me in

Rollo's gonna be there
Rob is gonna be there

C'mon I gotta be there
Oh won't you c'mon and let me in
I don't know why
I'm standing on the outside and I'm looking in
C'mon and let me in
How hard I try to be there, out of the dark and joining in
Let me in
