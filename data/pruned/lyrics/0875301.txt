We can go outside and play in the snow
I can make a little fire, we can break it down like Eskimos
Simply stated, there's no place I'd rather be
It's Christmas time for you and me, girl
Spread love, peace, and joy throughout the world
While every little boy's tryin' to find somethin' for his favorite girl
Yes, baby, your Santa Claus is on his way
He'll be keepin' you satisfied Christmas day

[Chorus: Kem]
What can I do
To make your dreams come true
For Christmas
What can I bring
To make your heart sing
So you'll be mine
For Christmas, mmm
Have a Merry Christmas, babe, hey, girl

[Verse 2: Ledisi]
There'll be jingle bells for you and me
We'll snuggle by the Christmas tree
A celebration of green and gold
We'll sing along to Nat King Cole
Good tidings to all and to all good cheer
I just wanna know my baby is here
Keepin' me warm all through the night, yeah
I've got an angel by my side
You might also like[Chorus: Ledisi, Ledisi & Kem]
What can I do
To make your dreams come true
For Christmas
What can I bring
To make your heart sing tonight
So you will be mine (Mine)

[Verse 3: Kem, Ledisi & Both]
Christmas is finally here
I'll be yours anytime of the year
And I would do anything
All I want is the joy you bring
I'll give you my heart wrapped up in a bow
Fa-la-la-la-la all the way we go, girl
It's Christmas when I'm lovin' you, yeah

[Chorus: Kem, Ledisi & Both]
What can I do, hey
To make your dreams come true
For Christmas
Be mine for Christmas, ooh, ooh
What can I bring you, girl? Ohh
I wanna make your dreams come true
So you'll be mine, I wanna be yours
Will you be mine, ba-a-abe? Yes, be mine
Ho-ho-ho, for Christmas
Oh-whoa, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Hey
[Outro: Kem & Ledisi]
Be mine for Christmas
I just wanna love you, girl
I wanna know will you be mine?
I will do anything, baby
We can cuddle over by the fire, yeah
I like that
Have a Merry Christmas, girl, you, yeah
You
Oh, you think you bad, don't you?
Hahaha
I know you do
You said anything?
Girl, I'll give you anything
Be mine
