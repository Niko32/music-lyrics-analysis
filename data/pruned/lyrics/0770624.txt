There is a light switch
In the dark
Where a conscience
Can't be won
And you know that the simplest things
They're so perfectly placed
And I can tell you now
That I can reach you every night

[Chorus 1]
Because I got a tender face
In my mind
Oh I got a tender face
In my mind

[Verse 2]
Have never age
And I have faith that this
Will never change
Cause I know that
When I touch you i feel
Something pushing my blood
Deeper into my heart
And I can tell you now
That you will never be alone
You might also like[Chorus 2]
You know I got a tender face
In my mind
Oh I've got a tender face in my mind

[Outro]
Oh I've got a tender face
In my mind
Oh I've got a tender face
In my mind
Oh I've got a tender face
Oh I've got a tender face
Oh I've got a tender face
Oh I've got a tender face
