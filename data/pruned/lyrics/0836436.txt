I should have found a way, but I didn't know how
Long road behind me, you know how hard I tried
Making up, making up, making up for lost time
Too many things I wish, I could try again
Too many times I say, but I just couldn't win
You gotta hope for something, the only way to get by
Making up making up making up for lost time
Better late than never, so they say
I've been waiting forever, just to have one more day, yeah! [2x]
Oh said it's just like a game, but we play no more now
I've been playing this game for too long now
When i find a wild thing, Oh I'm working, pass me by [??]
Making up making up making up for lost time
