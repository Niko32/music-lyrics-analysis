Let's have a lil' Henny, refill your cup
Tonight we wanna have it, only one fuck
You gon' get addicted, you gon' get addicted
We all on the floor, showin' ah-ah
You gon' get addicted, you gon' get addicted
You gon' get addicted, yeah

[Verse 1: Teeflii]
Round and round, can I trade places with you?
Goin' up and down, yeah yeah-yeah
I'll let you ride it if you just climb on top
Don't stop fo' nothin', Annie, do what you do, yeah
I ain't playin' with you, girl
When we bumpin' and grindin', oh, all night

[Chorus: Teeflii]
Let's have a little Henny, refill your cup
Tonight we wanna have it, only one fuck
You gon' get addicted, you gon' get addicted
We all on the floor, showin' ah-ah
You gon' get addicted (Gon' get addicted), you gon' get addicted
You gon' get addicted, oh-oh

[Verse 2: Snoop Dogg & Teeflii]
Another cold one, girl, now you want me
Listen here, Annie, yo girl been on me
Annie, are ya walkin'? You say that you couldn't be
Fly as a muthafucker, bitches is on me
Crenshaw District, look at what we did here
Now I'm in the Valley, fuckin' with a rich bitch
Swing, bada-bing, bada-bong (Bada-bong, bada-bong)
Seen with a G, gotta go (Gotta go)
Baby girl, he ain't gotta know
I keep it all the way, undercover light
It show you another life
Get prepared to be whipped, spooned and gloved (Oh)
Dip the flare with my dick
You might also like[Chorus: Teeflii]
Let's have a little Henny, refill your cup
Tonight we wanna love it, we only gon' fuck

We all on the floor, showin' ah-ah
You gon' get addicted (Addicted), you gon' get addicted
You gon' get addicted, oh-oh

[Verse 3: DJ Quik & Teeflii]
I'm a go in like the first firemen on the scene
'S a way to chill the smoke, know what I mean?
I wanna have a straight Ménage-à-trois
Both 'em pussies fat like some Foie gras
The way I talk to the pussy like a toddler
I say coochie, coochie, coo, then I gobble 'er
I got a lotta lights, but this my favorite review
Leave eyes to her hips and let her hair show through
And even if that pussy's got a lil' whif
I'ma still take it and treat it like a gift
I'm addicted, I stopped and went down and licked it
Kick back on a shrub, because the pussy's a drug (Now I got you addicted)

[Chorus: Teeflii]
Let's have a little Henny, refill your cup
Tonight we wanna love it, we only gon' fuck
You gon' get addicted (Don't get addicted), you gon' get addicted
We all on the floor, showin' ah-ah
You gon' get addicted, you gon' get addicted
You gon' get addicted, oh-oh
