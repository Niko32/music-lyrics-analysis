Two times the highest speed, full gas is all I need
Head out and just let go, it's everything but slow
Noone can follow me, in my suped up 383

I'm hooked on speed, that is what I need
And I guess that is pretty ironic
Cuz I wanna be faster than fast and supersonic
I tear it up cuz I can't stop
I'm gonna break the rear end loose when I move it
And I told you so, I'm supersonic

I want a fuller tank, more money in the bank
I want to stay soulfree, more guns to protect me
Full throttle sonic boom, I want more petrol fume
B-body rocketeer, I just want to disappear

I'm hooked on speed, that is what I need
And I guess that is pretty ironic
Cuz I wanna be faster than fast and supersonic
I tear it up cuz I can't stop
I'm gonna break the rear end loose when I move it
And I told you so, I'm supersonic

Still I could use more zap, I don't want to slo-mo crap
I'm gonna go for a 440, I can't see how that could bore me
Hot action burning wheels, puke up your latest meals
Alone without a care, hitting speeds you wouldn't dareYou might also like
