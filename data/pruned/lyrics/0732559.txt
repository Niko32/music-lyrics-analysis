The day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
She no longer needs you

[Verse 2]
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you

[Chorus]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 3]
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you

[Verse 4]
She goes out, you stay home
She says that long ago she knew someone, but now he's gone
She doesn't need him
You might also like[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years

[Verse 5]
The day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her
