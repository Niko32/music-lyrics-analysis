Down every lonely street
I talk of you
To everyone I meet

I wander here and there
Looking everywhere
But you are gone from me
And I'm left at sea

To call your name
And search each passing phase
For your lost smile
Your sudden tender grace

Though friends all say
There's nothing to do about you
My heart can't rest 'til I find you

To call your name
And search each passing phase
For your lost smile
Your sudden tender grace

Though friends all say
There's nothing to do about you
