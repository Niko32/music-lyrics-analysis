I was born, generation 96
Where computer bugs are fixed
And everything is yours with button and a click
Where everyone's demanding
And you can wage wars with computer keyboards
Where children run wild
Religion's out of style
Faded blue jeans plus
Swagger is how we paint the new scene
And you aren’t any different if you don’t walk persistent
And learn to lead the crowd
Hate, it isn’t something that you’re born with
It’s something that you're taught
We were taught to hate a nation
We were taught to hate a lot
Trust, this is much bigger than me
It’s much bigger than we
This is much bigger than U.S
It’s bigger than Nike shoes
And rocking some Taylor Chucks
It’s bigger than nightly news
And bigger than Donald Duck
Yup, Something that can’t be touched
It’s a little bit of hope, a little of trust
Rocking your first show and seeing the hands up
It’s a mother first child
A baby’s first smile
It’s the purity of man without living in denial
Your future, present, and past
It’s the moment that you’re breathing
The moment you're living now

Now look around, everywhere that you go
Broken people on the street
Broken down roads where the towns are gentrified
Death rates are high, which leads to a broken soul
But take a second slow down, breath the air around
Stop feeling sorrow
"Let’s replace the liquor stores with a [children’s] playground"
But hey
"If you never start to day you’ll never finish tomorrow,"
Any day now you can learn to be creative
Or you can learn to stay down
Learn to say a prayer while rocking faded hand me downs
"But if you really love the people you won’t put your hands down,"
Muslims, Christians, and Jews, "Baha’u’llah, Budda, God,"
We’re just trying to get by
It’s more than codeine and smoking nicotine
It’s learning to be a teacher and educating these teens
Your art is a paint brush you've been painting this scene
Cause if you only love yourself, have you really learn to live?
Or are you only just alive?
