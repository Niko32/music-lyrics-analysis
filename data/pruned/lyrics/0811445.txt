Sex, death
Sex, death

When I go to the show
All I see on the screen
Is a stream of pure vulgarity
I wrote down a note
I complained for a day
To the House of Representatives
They laughed
In my face
They said "Son you're a one-in-a-million minority"
The name of the game
Is to titillate the brain
Stimulate the immorality
I was so offended
As I sat for three hours
It was mental cruelty
I was so shocked
Just a little more flesh
Just a little more blood
Little closer to the edge
A little deeper in the mud
I'll never be the same
You might also likeSex, death and money, sonny
Makes this wicked world go round
Sex, death and money
It's the Gospel here in Dragontown
Sex, death and money, honey
Grease the wheels and make them fly
Sex, death and money, sonny
That is why we all are gonna fry

Stuck my nose in the door
Ended up on the floor
In the middle of a nudie show
She danced on my lap
A couple hundred dollars later
I was up on a morals rap
I was so offended
As I sat for three hours
It was mental cruelty
I was so shocked
Just a little more flesh
Just a little more blood
Little closer to the edge
A little deeper in the mud
I'll never be the same

Sex, death and money, honey
Grease the wheels and make them fly
Sex, death and money, sonny
That is why we all are gonna fry
That is why we all are gonna fry
Sex, death and money
It's the Gospel here in Dragontown
Sex, death and money, honey
That is why we all are gonna
That is why we all are gonna fry
