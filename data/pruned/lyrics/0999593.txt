Excited
You're likely
To hurt yourself

Your head looks
Disproportionate
From pushing
Too hard to believe

You're not wrong
Just better off thinking it was only love

It hurts
Like a splinter stuck in your foot
And you've tried
But you can't
Get it out

And of course
You walk in the heat for miles
You forget the pain
But it comes back after a while

You're not wrong
Just better off thinking it was only love
You're not wrong
Just better off thinking it was only love
It was only love
You might also likeYou're not wrong
Just better off thinking it was only love
You're not wrong
Just better off thinking it was only love
It was only love
It was only love
It was only love
