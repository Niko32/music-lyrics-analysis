They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Well, I bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an 'Oscar', you can never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well, I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And beggin' down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part and I won't need rehearsin'
All I gotta do is act naturally
Well, I bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an 'Oscar', you can never tell
The movie's gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well, I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I'll know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
All I gotta do is act naturally
All I gotta do is act naturallyYou might also like
