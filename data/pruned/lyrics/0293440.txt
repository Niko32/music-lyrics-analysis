New York Stater spit it in Beta
This my geek flow when I heat throw its for the paper
Niggas owe me a favor, I'm good til I'm collecting it
I ain't putting out no bullshit I'm a perfectionist
I been bruising the game
Yall niggas new to the game
Old school nigga with swag Kool and the Gang
Hip Hop my preference but I can switch styles up
Hop Hop my preference but I can switch styles up

Hook 8 Bars

Not a single fuck was given you can't blame me
I grew up in the Heights I ain't come up like a Brady
Make movies when it pop in the club, Schorsezy
These mothers is hood rats and they kids is more lazye
Niggas screaming they back I can't, I never left here
I was on my papi shit flexing showing my chest hairs
Flights up and down the coast, fuck if we lounge in coach
Soon as I hit that city I put it down the most
The flow is nice no manners
They radio directed corrected to program us can't stand us
We was in that Mazda 929 with Blammas
Fast forward to the future everybody got a camera

My CP3 flow, legal and ducking rico
Funny how some niggas could rap but couldn't read tho
I glow like Lero, Leroy on the Le-low
Your swag need an update you looking like an Evo
I was living check to check, die hard Wu-Tang fan so I was raised on the concept protect your neck
Crown street Schnectady Utica, protect your neck, anybody popping in the hood then he better rep
They said life wasn't easy
I had to learn the hard way shit I dropped out like Yeezy
Bars on Fiji
Spitting that quarter water can't see me
I got next better belive me
