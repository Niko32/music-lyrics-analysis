He fell as I tripped him; he won't smile again
The fruits of the loops of the friendships that droop
They pulled up my head as I try to lay dead
Never realise I'm painting the corners, the edge
As the fruits of the loops of the friendships that droop

Where do you go when you hide your love away?
Where do you go when you hide your love away?

There's no point in asking; there'll be no reply
As you try to convict me I'll move side to side
The fruits of the loops of the friendships that droop
The situation cannot be rectified
We're drowning the small ones with loose lips and lies
As the fruits of the loops of the friendships that droop
