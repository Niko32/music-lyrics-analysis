Here I go again
Better off this way for now
So let go
And here I go again
Better off this for way for now
So let go

[Chorus: Eric Luttrell]
Hey dragging me that way
Breathe
But I can't feel your eyes upon my skin
Hey, begging me to stay here
But I can't stop the rain from coming in

No, I can't stop the rain from coming in

[Verse]
And here I go again
Better off this way for now
So let go
And here I go again
Better off this for way for now
So let go

[Chorus]
Hey, dragging me that way
Breathe
And I can't feel your eyes upon my skin
Hey, begging me to stay here
But I can't stop the rain from coming in
No, I can't stop the rain from coming in
You might also like[Chorus]
Hey, dragging me that way
Breathe
But I can't feel your eyes upon my skin
Hey, begging me to stay here
But I can't stop the rain from coming in

[Outro]
No, I can't stop the rain from coming in
No, I can't stop the rain from coming in
