Every shawty that I know
Comes to me like, "Do you know
Why all the guys that I meet
Treat me like a piece of meat?"

[Verse 1]
I wanna say, hey
He was raised that way
But that's not my place
Every dude I invite to my place
To chill
Always a buzz kill
I don't set myself up but they gas me
Always seem to ask me
Can we make it butt naked nasty

[Chorus]
Can we kick it
Without you trying to trick shit
I really hope this isn't all
Of the men that I meet
I just want a little homie
To come kick it with me

[Verse 2]
And I wonder
What kind of pressure are they under
Trying to stay in the loop with all their brothers
(With all ya brothers)
But I'm not no one hit fucking wonder
(What you thought this was, ass the first day? Please, please.)
Lil shawty just wanna chill
Cause she an intellectual (uh huh)
A sapiosexual (uh huh)
Stop trynna cop a feel
I just wanna vibe with ya
Smoke
But I won't get high with ya
Stop trying to set the mood for bullshit
Just take what you can get
You might also like[Chorus]

[Outro]
Why every guy that I try to bypass, only want the ass?
(uh huh)
Why every guy that I try to bypass, only want the ass?
(uh huh)
Why every guy that I try to bypass, only want the ass?
(uh huh)
Why every guy that I try to by-bye-bye

She.go
Don't let her go
She.go
Don't let her

[Sample: Shego]
Hold it right there, Slick
I don't do cakes
I don't bake em
And I don't jump out of em
