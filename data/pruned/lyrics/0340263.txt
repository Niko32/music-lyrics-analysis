A cherry sunset blossoms;
We're not there to watch it fall
On the vacant canvas
We should be waiting
With our face down on the grass
Staring till our eyes give way
Paint this city black
While the night's still young

[Bridge]
Go!

[Verse 2]
This cherry sunset withers
Words as frail as paper
Dawn I thought we'd never see
Alone on this silent beach
Nothing we can do
There's nothing we can do

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Refrain]
The sky, it burns itself
The sky, it burns itself out
Sky, it burns itself out
The sky, it burns itself
You might also like[Bridge]
The trees rot down to nothing
Throats dry out and corpses fill the sidewalks
These promenades, our graveyards

[Refrain]
The sky, it burns itself out
Sky, it burns itself out

[Interlude]
There is nothing we can do
The sky, it burns itself
And I think we're all about to fucking die
The trees rot down to nothing
Throats dry out and corpses fill these sidewalks
These promenades, our graveyards
Kneeling down on what's left, sacrificed upon doomsday
Oh, if we could take it back and see one last twilight
Yeah!

[Pre-Chorus]
Take a picture, take a picture
(Take what?)
Take a picture, take a picture
Take a picture
Take a picture, take a picture
Take a picture, take a picture
It will last longer
[Chorus]
Our hands in prayer formation
Our elbows on the bed
One last try for Heaven
Thinking, "Who wants flowers when you're dead?"
You're dead
When you're dead

[Breakdown ]
Cherry, cherry
Cherry, cherry
Cherry, cherry
Cherry, cherry
Cherry, a cherry sunset
