Never you mind it, never you mind it
I can see the smoke rings in the sky, I can feel the water rising
Never you mind it, never you mind it
Streets are paved with empty words, signs of life are all obscure
Where do you find it, where do you find it
You see the lives you could have lived, what you take and what you give
It’s all in the timing, it’s all in the timing


Getting money, getting love, getting fed, getting fucked up
Human nature, it’s human nature
Getting money, getting love, getting fed, getting fucked up
Human nature, it’s human nature


It’s a struggle everyday, if you chase yourself away
What are you hiding? What are you hiding?
You got a love that will not fade, there’s no end to what you’ll change
How do you like it? How do you like it?
You are a source of all you see, and it gets hard to believe
How do you fight it? How do you fight it?
You don’t look back only ahead, running circles with your friends
Every night yeah, every night yeah
