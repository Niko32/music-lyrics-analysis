Landed my ship you can call me Picard
Check to the left but the tunnel is small
Find maru mari the problem is solved I can make my
Whole body turn into a ball
Yeah I’m on a roll like I’m jelly or I’m margarine
And everywhere I go I’m literally going for a spin
When I get a missile in the midst of the mission
I feel so divine like I’m H to the Izzo
Better know your place if you get up in my grill
I’m finna teach a bitch a lesson like I’m really Ms. Frizzle
I can level whole worlds to hot cakes -- Aunt Jemima
Act civil or I’ll blow you up just call me J. Oppenheimer
Yeah I’m a one woman army
Got a gun up on my arm like a tommy
Imma kamehameha with the long beam
Pop off like the bottle top on Dom P
When I’m hit by an enemy I feel the pain
Killin me softly like Lauryn Hill sang
I’m dizzy I feel like I sip purple drank
I get giddy when I see a energy tank
Shootin the bubble I walk out the door
Lookin' for trouble You already know
I got a new weapon I’m ready to show
I be droppin' a bomb while I tuck and I roll
I’m about to blow
Like a big land mine cuz
I can roll and drop a bomb
At the same damn time
You might also like[Chorus]
Don’t you like my power ups?
Got a few add ‘em up
Now I’ve had about enough
Talking shit wrap it up
No one woman should have all this power
Woah my power level broken yo' scouter

[Verse 2]
I’d rather have the ice than the wave beam so
When a hater wanna try and overtake me
Make ‘em chill I’m the AC hah
Now that’s what I really call a brain freeze
Ice cold as the top of the Poconos
Leave ‘em comotose like a overdose
If you dumb and still want to throw them bows
You a bird-brain fool you a chocobo
Got a fresh new pair gimme higher jumps
Now I get air like Michael dunks
When I lift off better get lost
Cuz imma have my feet up in your face
You gone bite the dust
Why you stay in place
Like you callin on a land line?
I’m in outerspace
Yeah I’m ballin with that hang time
Found a little armor call it Varia
Lookin fly like I’m workin at LaGuardia
Now you running go ahead and get that cardio
Side-eye like I’m Daria Ay
They askin where they do that at?
Cuz I’m from out a town
Chop you-Chop you with the screw attack
That’s gone slow you down
My body’s a weapon I’m spinnin’ so fast
You won’t see me coming to whoop on that ass
You lookin real DUMB are you doing the math
I will make you a fraction I’ll cut you in half
Look at you
Now look at this
Ha, made ya' look now I’m finna waste you bitch
[Chorus]
Don’t you like my power ups?
Got a few add ‘em up
Now I’ve had about enough
Talking shit wrap it up
No one woman should have all this power
Woah my power level broken yo' scouter
