You wild western windblown band
Life's waitin' up the road for you and the future's in your hands

Well I don't fly no aeroplanes
And I don't ride railroad trains
I just drive my truck down the blacktop lane to the next town

Next week we'll be in Jackson Hole
Got some good friends there to soothe our souls
Lord, don't you know
It's a good town

So roll on
You wild western windblown band
Life's waitin' up the road for you and the future's in your hands

I don't live for borrowing
Lord and I don't love just one thing
I believe in all that life brings down our highway

So if you hear our words and songs
Take what you need to be strong
Don't be afraid to love us
We won't do you no wrong
You might also likeSo roll on
You wild western windblown band
Life' waitin' up the road for you and the future's in your hands

Yeah, life's waitin' up the road for you and the future's in your hands
