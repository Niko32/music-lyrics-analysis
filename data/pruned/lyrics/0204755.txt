Give me a choice should i stay or leave
But I'm already gone and my heart still bleeds
You promise me things I promise you things
But as hard as we try the bond still break
Reality came and our love been arrange you show no care while I hold my heart by this chain
Why did it die you sit there as I pour down and cry
Seeing you happy with other guys in the hall but when I come up you say nothing at all
Why is it when we talk there's nothing else to say but I see that pretty smile when he's all up in your face
I penetrate for your emotions pressure pushing to get closer
Before you say it's over I forgot were over
We can get threw storm and pick back up where we belong
I'm torn down yea I'm really hurt
I really thought the only one you really wanted was Kurt,
Cause you use to always tell me you love a boy with dreads
But you told me alot and I feel misled
Thoughts on my mind lies in my head can't hardly sleep cause I cry in the bed
I just broke my cool now that blue turn to red,
It's like you forgot so much that we said
You wanna move on just hurry and leave
I was dedicated anything you said I believe
You in my arms was the only thing I need but now I can't do it now it's only in my dreams!
Tear after tear
Year after year
Kiss after kiss
Together as we live
I only think clear when it's dark the only time I could clear my brain and my thoughts
Tried to get time but i was to late
Just me and my pad with a lot of mistakes
You said you needed space so how much will it take I'm tired of being ignore no smile on my face
Remember Christmas
Remember Vday
Remember this summer
Remember my birthday
I'm throwing all of it in your face cause I past the finish line but couldn't win the race
I hold you
You hold me
We both cried
Apologize for our lies
We both saw a family in our eyes ironic I was the only one hurt this time
Fall to deep
Love to hard
You felt no pain while I had the scars
Now I feel so alone I'm next in line for greatness next heir to the throne
Better than Dre
Better than Nas
Better than PAC
Better than Big
Better than Jay and Ye ever been
Better than Play
Better than Kid
Better than any rapper who ever went
Thanks to you I been better than I been
Till the day I die I'm still gonna be the same ole guy
