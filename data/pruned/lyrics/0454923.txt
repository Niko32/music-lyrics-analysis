Motherfuckers' always in my parking spot
You're a small dog, but you bark a lot
I don't know what to say, It gets hard a lot
I'ma think things through, but I'm lost a lot
Why am I lost a lot?
I don't fucking know
And your debit card's always full of snow
And this shit's real fucked, do you not think so?
Why these bitches always wanna play the piccolo?
I got 21 questions, but I got like way more dimensions
Always trying to stretch me out, suspension
Saying that I'm fake like your damn extensions
I don't think I am
My mind's gone blank like my polygraph
My thoughts gone stale but I can still rap
You say I'm whack, well I'ma be damned

[Chorus: Zac Flewids]

Blank (My mind's still)


[Verse 2: Zac Flewids]
You might also like(yo)

Yo, I'm trapped in my brain walls
Better write it down so it sinks in your brain walls
I tried to take a jump, but I looked, it's a great fall
Deffs not down for that, for the damn stall
I'm trying to figure shit out
Something bigger than just doubt
They gonna give it to me like a discount
Don't settle for your shit man, this counts
(The cat's all ready and he finna pounce) x3


[Chorus]
