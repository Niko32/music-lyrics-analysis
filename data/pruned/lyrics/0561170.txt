What you heard is true
The disappointing truth
Is I don't like to lose
Shame on me, shame on me

[Verse 2]
Promises I made
And bills I never paid
Another missed birthday
Shame on me, shame on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Bridges that I burned
And lovers that I hurt
Lessons never learned
Shame on me, shame on me

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm not tryin' to be perfect
It's not like it's worth it
Everyone hurts the same
Hey, I'm not tryin to be special
'Cause I ain't no angel
Everyone hurts the same
What a shame

I repeat my words
Sometimes they seem rehearsed
And I speak out of turn
Shame on me, shame on me

[Pre-Chorus]
Bridges that I burned
And lovers that I hurt
Lessons never learned
Shame on me, shame on me

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm not tryin' to be perfect
It's not like it's worth it
Everyone hurts the same
Hey, I'm not tryin' to be special
'Cause I ain't no angel
Everyone hurts the same
What a shame

[Bridge]
That we're hiding underneath our skin
And we're scared of letting somebody in
Nobody showed us how to live
Or how to be perfect
It's not like it's worth it
[Chorus]
Hey, I'm not tryin' to be perfect
It's not like it's worth it
Everyone hurts the same
And, hey, I'm not tryin' to be special
'Cause I ain't no angel
Everyone hurts the same
What a shame
I'm not tryin' to be perfect
It's not like it's worth it
Everyone hurts the same
And, hey, I'm not tryin' to be special
'Cause I ain't no angel
Everyone hurts the same
What a shame
