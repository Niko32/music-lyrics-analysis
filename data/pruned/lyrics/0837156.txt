Which way is up, what's goin' down?
(I just don't know, no more)
I don't know, I don't know
(C'mon turn around)
Which way is up, what's goin' down?

[Verse 1]
The world is moving much too fast (Too fast)
Enjoy the good things and make them last (Make em last)
Each day there's something new to learn (New to learn)
Everyday is a new way for what you learn
I've gotta make money, I've got to live (Gotta live)
I'm not complainin?, that's just the way it is (Like it is)
A ball and chain around my neck
The more I dig out, the deeper I get

[Chorus]
Which way is up, what's goin' down?
I just don't know, no more
C'mon turn around, people
Which way is up, what's goin' down?
I just don't know, no more
C'mon turn around

[Verse 2]
Got a whole new outlook on life itself
I'm gonna make it, won't settle for nothin' else (Nothing else)
It's up to me to achieve it
And I know I will 'cause I believe it
The more I know, the more I'll grow
Knowledge is key and I wanna flow
This ball and chain is comin' off my neck
I'm gonna pick this ball and chain
I'm gonna put it in check

Which way is up, what's goin' down?
I just don't know, no more
C'mon turn around, help me
Which way is up, which way is up?
Which way is up? That way
Which way is up?
Which way?
Which way?
Which way? That way
Which way? That way
Which way? That way
