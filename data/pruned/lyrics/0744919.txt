Chew that bazooka, big barracuda
I see the hunger in your eyes
I don't need you to spend all your gouda
Might as well throw it in the fire

[Pre-Chorus: Alyxx Dione]
But you gotta work, work like you own it
Cause you gotta play, play, play your part
Boy, if you want love, you better know
The way through my body's through my heart

[Chorus: Alyxx Dione]
I got the keys to the kingdom now
They ching-a-ling when my chain hang down
My golden gates got the boys locked out
But who got the keys, who got the keys, oh!
I got the keys to the kingdom now
They ching-a-ling when my chain hang down
My golden gates got the boys locked out
Cause I got the keys to the kingdom now

[Refrain: Alyxx Dione]
Cha-ching-a-linga-linga
Dat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat
You like dat, dat, dat, dat
Cha-ching-a-linga-linga

My Lamborghini don't need to car keys
To open them butterfly doors
Not tryna be cocky, no Ricky Bobby
I'm not used to going slow, no

[Pre-Chorus: Alyxx Dione]
But you gotta work, work like you own it
Cause you gotta play, play, play your part
Boy, if you want love, you better know
The way through my body's through my heart

[Chorus: Alyxx Dione]
I got the keys to the kingdom now
They ching-a-ling when my chain hang down
My golden gates got the boys locked out
But who got the keys, who got the keys, oh!
I got the keys to the kingdom now
They ching-a-ling when my chain hang down
My golden gates got the boys locked out
Cause I got the keys to the kingdom now

[Refrain: Alyxx Dione]
Cha-ching-a-linga-linga
Dat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat, dat
You like dat, dat, dat, dat
Cha-ching-a-linga-linga
[Bridge: Both]
Won't you let me in, won't you let me?
Won't you let me in?
Cause I'mma knock it down
If I let you in, if I let you
If I let you in, would you love me now?

[Verse 3: Jason Derülo]
I'll push the start and turn you on, babe
You got no reason to be lonely, girl
Won't you let me in, won't you let me?
Won't you let me in?
And watch me knock it down

[Pre-Chorus: Alyxx Dione]
But you gotta work, work like you own it
Cause you gotta play, play, play your part
Boy, if you want love, you better know
The way through my body's through my heart

[Chorus: Alyxx Dione]
I got the keys to the kingdom now
They ching-a-ling when my chain hang down
My golden gates got the boys locked out
But who got the keys, who got the keys, oh!
I got the keys to the kingdom now
They ching-a-ling when my chain hang down
My golden gates got the boys locked out
Cause I got the keys to the kingdom now

You like dat, dat, dat, dat
Cha-ching-a-linga-linga

[Outro: Jason Derülo]
I'm still tryna act a damn fool
But you're tryna throw me a cage, boo
Wanna lock me up and throw away the key
Wanna ring that ching-a-linga, don't need a key
