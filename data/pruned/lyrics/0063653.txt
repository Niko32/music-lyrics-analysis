Chorus:
Put your hands up
Glad you came out
What you gone do with your bad self
Scream if ya’ll hear me
And you know we gone rock it til the sun comes up
Let the music play all night baby
Get your dance on
Glad you came out
Beam me on up to wherever I can find you lady
Get your mack on
Glad you came out
You can interrupt if you think you might be better for me

Verse 1: (Sos)
In the driver seat sweet
Keep it hot like Laredo
Record highs energized
Pull a horse from the stable
Burning the fuego
Stacking the queso
Cats call me k sos
Bite like a mako
Geared for the big screen
Downin’ a caseload
Coke in my nasal
Im damn hard to fade though
You can say what you say yo
But can they do this sporting horns and a halo
Shout it from the rooftops
Came to blow up new spots
My shot to be live on cable
So far from a fable
I’ma get this bread pass it under the table
And I know ya’ll ride
Can’t emulate this ya’ll tried
But your just unable
Ain’t too late to save you
Watch close this time as we paint a picture
Ascending paragraphs into all the unfamiliar
This is your last rites
Save your less than savvy scripture
I’ma just keep ripping it and see if anybody wit us
You might also likeChorus (Sos)


Verse 2: (Rams)
Hollywood talks, money comes then the hoes flock
And everybody starts acting the same robots
Send me your prayers, I don’t know stop
Will this lifestyle kill me I hope not
But its starting to catch up a whole lot
Everyone’s in love and I know not
Anything that can hinder my dreams I wrote off
That’s why I’m in this bitch fucked up and so lost
But here I am, stoned silly with a drink in my hand
Hanging out with millionaires trying to keep up with them
What I been doing lately, maybe I can’t explain it
But I relocated to Miami and it feels amazing
Kushed up, stayin fresh dressed to impress
Model on my arm with my song on I guess I’m blessed
But she ain’t gonna be around for long
Nah she only made it this far cuz the liquors strong, ya’ll

Chorus:

Verse 3: (J.O.)
In the driver seat
Bumping me cuz I feel like their ain’t too many out hot as me
Fighting ours like the ones at the lottery
Its in my blood in my veins every artery
J.O. the animal ya I gotta be
See whats happening American economy
Don’t have a lot of time I’m need you all to follow me
What’s going down the poverty, going up
Multi million dollar companies blowing up
1%er  money growin’ never slowing up
I got my mind on my money owning land
Its not over man, got the golden plan
Put the mutherfuckin’ world on my shoulders and
You will never see me fall like October
I told ya, it doesn’t matter if I’m on when its over
Ain’t a mountain to high to go over
I’m overhead like a poor comb over
I leave the beat slumped over, in a coma
Give my heart like an open doner so no
This isn’t for any notoriety
I just do it in all types variety
In any fashion, deadly passion
What they call a fatal attraction ayyy
