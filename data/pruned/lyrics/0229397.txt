Empty, I was just an empty shell 'til I met you
Hungry, just another hungry heart 'til I found you
Loving, loving was a feeling I never knew
Dying, I was dying for the life time with you
(Both)
Your love is my breathe of life
Your love blows me away
I wasn't born yesterday
But I just started living today
(George)
Touching, there was lightning in the night when I touch you
And dancing, dancing in your loving arms I wanted you
A love song swaying to the records that jukebox played
Living, I started living when you loved me each day
(Both)
Your love is my breathe of life
Your love blows me away
I wasn't born yesterday
But I just started living today
(Both)
Your love is my breathe of life
Your love blows me away
I wasn't born yesterday
But I just started living today
Yes, I just started living today...You might also like
