Places to go
People to see
That I don't know
Fresh air
New ground to walk on
Got the warm sunshine
Tugging at me
The road ahead is all I see
Good times waiting my arrival
It's been a long time coming
My revival
Yeah

Life is calming my name
Ain't never gonna be the same
Ill go dancing in the pourin' rain if I want to
Free to be what I wanna be
Nobody stopping me
No one telling me what I can't do
Yeah life, life is calling my name
Oh yeah

A chance like this doesn't come every day
Gotta take it now
Can't throw it away
This ain't no time for hesitating
Sometimes its money
Sometimes its fame
And it ain't easy when your chasing a dream
So close that you can always touch it
When it's in your hands
You just gotta love it
Ooooh
