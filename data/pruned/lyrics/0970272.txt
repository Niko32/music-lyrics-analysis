I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
Got in trouble had to roam left my gal and left my home
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
Just a kid acting smart I went and broke my darling's heart
I guess I was too young to know
They took me off to Georgia Main locked me to a ball and chain
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
All alone I bear the shame I'm a number not a name
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
All I do is sit and cry when that evening train goes by
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blow
I'll be locked here in this cell till my body's just a shell
And my hair turns whiter than snow
I'll never see that gal of mine cause I'm in Georgia doing time
I heard that lone-vow-vow-some whistle blowYou might also like
