I saw a couple friends at the side of the road
With the right idea
They introduced me to the only one I did not know
Her name is Kelsey
Nice to meet you
Thin blonde hair
(hair, hair)
Kentucky drawn
In her (?)
Hands that could strangle the life out of you
I'm out the door
I don't apologize

[Chorus]
Kelsey won't you call me back
Kelsey I've been walking on the cracks
Praying that you don't call
You've been breaking my back

[Verse 2]
I knew that something wasn't right
I had another girl on my mind
As I showed Kelsey the city
There was me, her, her cousin and a couple of friends
Driving around trying to find a gas station
Mixed Mountain Dew with our whiskey
Underage and under the influence
4, 5 products of suburban affluence
Trying so hard just to drive straight
The drill we run through is all we can do
So we drink 'til this down is gray
You might also like[Bridge]
We look much older than our age is
We got some time
So lets waste it

[Chorus]x2

[Verse 3]
I pulled over the car on the side of the street
If this wasn't (?) we would've headed to the beach
But it was so we didn't
And we headed to the grass
Lean back with my hands on the hot concrete
And then she kissed me
And I kissed back
I couldn't quite figure out what she was getting at
And we woke from Americana dreams like snap
And she told me the real one was on her back

[Bridge 2]
Sometimes you don't know that you're fake
'Til you fake it
Where did the time go
Let's chase it

[Chorus]x2
[Outro]
Please Kelsey
Believe Kelsey
(Kelsey, won't you call me back)
Please Kelsey
Believe, Kelsey
(Kelsey, won't you call me back)
Please Kelsey
Believe, Kelsey
(Kelsey, won't you call me back)
Please Kelsey
Believe Kelsey
(Kelsey, won't you call me back)
