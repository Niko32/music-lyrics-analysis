You know that he asked me
Are you happy?
Yes I am
I just felt shit worse than crying
Hurts and pains worse than lying
I gave up too much to give a damn
Baby pain gets better, trouble setter

[Hook: India Shawn]
My cold heart can melt
But you can't be in love all by yourself

[Verse 2: India Shawn]
You know that he asked me
Are you sad?
Was sometimes
But the other possibilities
Don't need to make up
Too busy, you're my peace of mind
Should I want world peace
And somewhere off four seasons

[Hook]

[Verse 3: India Shawn]

Anything you ever did
It's as and I won't try
I don't care, you're here
I'm not sure that I am anything
Until you remind, rewriteYou might also like
