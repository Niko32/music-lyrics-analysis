It's one, two, buckle my blues

[Verse 1]
I'm makin' it this time
I'm makin' it this time
I'm makin' it this time around
Before I lose my mind again
Before I lose my mind

[Verse 2]
Time, she rules my mind
I sit here markin' time
Well, I'm well in with the rockin' machine
Put me down, you don't know where I've been
Oh, I'm a rockin' machine

[Verse 3]
Lately, I've been thinkin'
What makes a man
But I can't for the life of me
Get away from the rockin' machine
Oh, I'm a rockin' machine
Oh, I'm a washin' machine
Oh, I'm a washin' machineYou might also like
