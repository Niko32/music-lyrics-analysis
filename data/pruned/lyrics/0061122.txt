A shorty workin in the strip club tryna get her tips up
Gotta get her nails done and her hair
A little extra for a dick suck
If you got ya chips up
You can get your knob topped off right there
See little mama wasn't raised like this
She became like this
Cuz she spent her life growin' up poor
Then she turned 18
Moved out then she made a vow that she wouldn't be broke no more
Now her mother was a teacher, father was a minister
She came up in the church and people wonder what got into her
She always had fancy dreams of fancy things
And marryin' a baller gettin' fancy rings
You could find her back stage at every rap show
Or sneakin' in the club through every back door
With a special attraction to rappers and actors
Cuz she know that celebrities got dough

[Bridge]
(oh my) She done got more miles than that '88 delta now
(so wild) she can't even look in the mirror at herself and smile
(oh my) but she don't give a damn about the names you call her
(so wild) cuz she do what she gotta do just to be a baller

We just wanna be some ballers
(who hit the mall and throw it all in the bags)
We just wanna be some ballers
(and buy it all don't even look at the tags)
We just wanna be some ballers
(go hit the club with 23's on a slam)
We just wanna be some ballers
(and go get everything that we never had)

[Verse 2]

Now he just wanna ball, but he ain't talkin' tryna hoop
He coulda did that but he dropped outta school
Always looked up to the neighbourhood dope dealers
And he thought that hustlin' was kinda cool
After the cash skippin algebra class
Catch him posted on a corner with a strap and a pack
'bout to let his money stack and then pull up in a Jag
He ain't worried 'bout math, fuck a hypotenuse fool
Little homie thinkin' he too cool
Only 16 sittin' in a ride on 2-2's
You can't tell him he ain't the doodoo
'cuz his money stay comin' even got a little crew too
And his crew's dudes, that's a little bit older
Stay movin' boulders
Got that cola
They high rollas
Seen mo' Os than fruit loops
But one day, when the drought hit
It left everybody but him out here without shit
He ain't worried 'bout it
'cuz his surplus stashed in couches
He the last one out here who still got weight
Niggas in the circle start to feel that hate
Caught him slippin' kicked the door in to his place
Laid him on the ground and shot him in his face
Got him for his dope and all his cake, all his cake
Got him for his dope and all his cake
Niggas from his circle start to feel that hate
Got him for his dope and all his....cake
[Hook]
