I don't wanna talk about it anymore
You chose to leave me here to explore
Go 'head, search in the sea, there's plenty more
But don't expect me to leave my door open for you

[Pre-Chorus:]
And there's no looking back
You chose to walk the path of tearing up my heart
Oh, boy I loved you
Look at the mess you made
You threw a hand grenade
And blew up everything
Oh boy how could you?

[Chorus:]
I will never
Make the same mistake
I'll be better
It's time to walk away

[Verse 2:]
I'm taking my love on this open road
You don't deserve me here anymore
Cause these nights of me crying alone
Turned my love to fear
The pain you gave
You'll never know
I'm done with all these tears
You'll never find another me, no
Oh, I'm over
Oh, I'm over you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus:]
And there's no looking back
You chose to walk the path of tearing up my heart
Oh, boy I loved you
Look at the mess you made
You threw a hand grenade
And blew up everything
Oh boy how could you?

[Chorus:]
I will never
Make the same mistake
I'll be better
It's time to walk away
