Jimmy Jimmy, uh uh Jimmy

You been cramping my house
Leaving your stuff laying around
Get your apron now baby don't live here for free
Jimmy Jimmy, uh uh Jimmy

You waste all your time
Whilst you spend all my money
And I can't let it be, hey

Jimmy Jimmy, why you got to be so, pretty pretty?
Why'd you have to steal my heart Jimmy?
One touch and I fall apart Jimmy, yeah
You look good in my arms, good in my bed
I curse the day we met

Gimme gimme all you got, if you gonna stay
I need you to love me, Jimmy Jimmy hey
Gimme gimme all you got, if you gonna stay
I need you to love me, Jimmy Jimmy hey

Left the dishes again, uh
Come back late with your friends
Then you throw a party when I'm trying to get to sleep
Jimmy Jimmy, uh uh Jimmy

Start as cold as ice but you melt me like ice cream
Jimmy Jimmy, uh uh Jimmy

You just, put a spell on me, you make me go weak in the knees so I can't breath and
I'm an independent woman (oh yes you are), I just can't take it no more

The way you waste all your time
Whilst you spend all my money
What you doing to me?
Jimmy Jimmy, why you got to be so, pretty pretty?
