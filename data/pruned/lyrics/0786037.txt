Carbon beings in process leading to life that we have today
A billion years later, technology springs
Exploding progress pushes is forward
But exploring progress is tearing us down
What is fiction is fact
There is no blame for conditioning
Reality's created by ourselves
We're to blame for our problems
Cells of our shells, merge with the earth
Becoming separately involved, composting, transgressing
In order to embrace life and death, we must eliminate
The boundaries that lie between the physical and the spiritual
Symbiosis, a two way process
People read their lives and then create their psychosis
Staying conscious requires effort
Evolution re-awakes the primal subconscious
Aware, awake, alert
Know or felt by ones inner being
Flow and slower, observer and observed
A wave, infinite ocean
Life and death in cyclic motion
You're a human being
You have an ego and mind
It's a useful part of you but it's not you
Flow and slower, observer and observed

Life and death in cyclic motion
