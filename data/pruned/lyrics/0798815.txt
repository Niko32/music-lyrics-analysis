You bet you're ass I'm one of them
We're floating down strapped to air balloons
I'm looking down sipping a bottle of gin

It's raining zombies on wall street
We're gonna eat corrupt broker men
It's time us zombies have our time
Our first course begins

I'll eat their hearts and
I'll eat their brains
Give them a dose of payback pain

I'll eat their hearts and
I'll eat their brains
The end of lying, greedy men

It's raining zombies on wall street
You bet you're ass I'm one of them
When I get my hand on Rush Limbaugh
I'll split his legs like a chicken wing

It's raining zombies on wall street
Nowhere for the corrupt to run
Glenn Beck better hide man
Eat extremist Republicans

American royalty will end

Zombies walking through wall street
I'm dragging Ann Coulter by her hair
I'm gonna take her to the slum towns
Wanna show her how we live there

Zombies walking through Wall street
Coulter scream for her life to spare
But she never helped anyone
So her last breath will be right here

They treat us like we are mindless
American royalty will end
It's raining zombies on wall street
Nowhere for the corrupt to run
Murdoch better hide man
A message to you republicans

We're gonna eat their hearts and
Eat their brains
The end of all the lying, greedy men

We're gonna eat their hearts and
Eat their brains
In the end the world will finally be sane
