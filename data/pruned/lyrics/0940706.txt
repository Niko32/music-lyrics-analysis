And your mountain seems so tall
And you realize that life's not always fair
You can run away and hide
Let the old man decide
Or you can change your circumstances
With a prayer

When everything falls apart
Praise His name
When you have a broken heart
Raise your hands and say
"Lord, You're all I need
You're everything to me"
And He'll take the pain away
When it seem you're all alone
Praise His name
When you feel you can't go on
Just raise your hands and say
"Greater is He that is within me"
And you can praise the hurt away
If you'll just praise His name

Oh, you can overcome
By the blood of the lamb
And by the word of your testimony
You'll see the darkness go
As your faith begins to grow
You're not alone
So, how can you be lonely?
You might also likeWhen everything falls apart
Praise His name
When you have a broken heart
Just raise your hands and say
"Lord, You're all I need
You're everything to me"
And He'll take the pain away
When it seem you're all alone
Praise His name
When you feel you can't go on
Raise your hands and say
"Greater is He that is within me"
You can praise the hurt away
"Greater is He that is within me"
You can praise the hurt away
If you'll just praise His name
