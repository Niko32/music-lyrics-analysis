The arms I used to need can't hold me anymore
I haven't come to blame I do even ask you why
This time it's not the same I've come to say goodbye

No begging on my knees like all the times before
Are just the memories I'm leaving at your door
Don't ask me to explain so I won't have to lie
I've gotta go away and I've come to say goodbye

No begging on my knees...
Yes I've just gotta go away and I've come to say goodbyeYou might also like
