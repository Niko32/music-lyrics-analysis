Just because i made mistakes doesn't mean i meant it
Everytime i think about it I wish my mind was missin'
Cause' when i try to spit the real nobody tends to listen

But i guess thats just what happens when you find yourself
People tryna break you down instead of tryna help
But this is it for me
Im making History
Im bout' to show them that they're neva' gonna get to me
Neva gonna step to me not mentally or physically
Cll me all these names because a couple guys are into me
Call me all these names because my swag is full of energy
I swear these chicks are into me they tryna' be my frenemie

Cause' they heard im rppin now they tryna change my attitude
Cuttin a couple chicks off was somethin that i had to do
But im neva customed to them lames
But would i still be the same with all the money and the fame?
I doubt i ever put they pictures in a frame
They laughed at me waitin on the spotlight that neva came...You might also like
