I never seen you look so good
You never act the way you should
But I like it
And I know you like it too
The way that I want you
I gotta have you
Yes, I do
I never
I never ever stay out late
You know that I can hardly wait
Just to see you
And I know you cannot wait
Wait to see me too
I gotta touch you
'Cause baby we'll be
At the drive-in
In the old man's Ford
Behind the bushes
Until' I'm screamin' for more
Down the basement
Lock the cellar door
And baby
Talk dirty to me
You know I call you
I call you on the telephone
You know that little pitchin' home
So I can hear
When she say those words to me
And whisper so softly
I gotta hear you
'Cause baby we'll be
At the drive-in
In the old man's Ford
Behind the bushes
Until' I'm screamin' for more
Down the basement
Lock the cellar door
And baby
Talk dirty to me
C.C. pick up that guitar and talk to me
'Cause baby we'll be
At the drive-in
In the old man's Ford
Behind the bushes
Until' I'm screamin' for more, more, more
Down the basement
Lock the cellar door
And baby
Talk dirty to me
And baby
Talk dirty to me
And baby
Talk dirty to meYou might also like
