The father heard church bells at midnight
A wrong time for church bells to chime
He went to the tower, found a little girl there
Said, "Why ring the bells at this time?"

[Chorus]
I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm crying but my brother Jim's dying
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim

[Verse 2]
Please father, pray for him this Christmas
He's sick and he's in so much pain
The doctors all say, he'll be gone any day
So, I must ring the bells again

[Chorus]
I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
I'm sorry, I'm crying but my brother Jim's dying
And I'm ringing the bells for Jim

[Verse 3]
On the day after Christmas she brought him
Said, "Father, heed little Jim
You see, he got well, when he heard the church bells
I was ringing the bells for Jim"
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm just ringing the bells for Jim
Please father, ringing the bells for Jim
Sorry I'm crying but my brother Jim's dying
So, I'm ringing the bells for Jim
