Baby, tell me what's the deal?
When you come over
Are we gonna sit and talk
Or will we get much closer?

[Pre-Chorus]
Knock upon my door and I'll let you in
I'll lead you right into the living room where we can begin
Hold up, hold up, hold up, the curtains are wide open
And I don't want the whole world knowing

[Chorus x2]
Baby, close the curtains
Cause nobody don't have to know
Baby, close the curtains
Cause they ain't gon' get no peep show

[Verse 2]
Baby, tell me how you're feeling, are you in the mood?
I want control this evening, I'll leave it up to you
We can take this meeting and move it up to the bedroom
Take a minute, breathe, I'll be waiting

[Pre-Chorus]
You might also like[Chorus x2]

[Bridge]
Ooh, yeah, temptation is rising
It's like the room's on fire
I can tell you like this
Cause your tone is getting higher
Curtains, curtains
Curtains, curtains
Baby, come closer, feel the chemistry
But first you gotta close the curtains

[Chorus x2]
