"[?]"
"I'm not gonna work this... machine."
"A feast to my eye."

[Verse 1]
Humanity, relentless cycle, history repeats itself
We've come so far but not as near to changing what we really are

[Chorus]
Technological disguise
Hide behind electric eyes
"[?]

[Verse 2]
Daily grind, 9 to 5, nothing seems to change
Nothing ever seems to change (time ticks away)
Learn to hate, retaliate, nothing ever solved
Watch your problems multiply, hope divided slipping by
"[?]"

[Verse 3]
We run from our humanity, concealed behind technology
The more things change they stay the same, the cycle of mankind
"[?]"
Traitors lacking self control, enslaved both body and the soul
Hearts devoid of love and peace, possess no fear of God
Bowing down to gods of stone, moral values overthrown
Purity aside, lust is never satisfied
"[?]"
Government corrupt with lies, leaders lead with blinded eyes
The future is unknown, the future is well known
"I may be synthetic, but I'm not stupid."

Humanity, where are we going? Never mind where we have been
Will the cycle just continue when beginning runs to end?

[Chorus]
Technological disguise
Blinded by electric eyes
"[?] discretion should be exercised."
"[?]"

[Verse 5]
We run from our humanity, concealed behind technology
The more things change they stay the same, the cycle of mankind
The cycle of mankind
"[?]"

[Outro]
Born from the dust, beginnings of man
A seed of disobedience
Stain of the curse we've brought on ourselves
Damnation of the soul
Black roots of sin planted firmly within
The soil of our hearts
One way alone, mankind's only hope
Jesus Christ is our salvation!
Is our salvation!
Deliverance
And our salvation!
