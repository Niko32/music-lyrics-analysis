Ooh, woah, woah

[Verse 1: Beauty]
I could wait forever
But forever's way too long to be waitin' on ya
You don't seem to get it, do ya?
You better wake up
I'm doin' us a favor
Come on, boy, stop playin' with my heart

[Pre-Chorus: Beauty]
We can be more than temporary
Love you everyday like February
Tryna make us so official, like
Ooh, ah, ooh, ah

[Chorus: Beauty]
You're nothin' like them other boys, lover boy
And that's why I love you, boy
You're nothin' like them other boys, lover boy
And that's why I love you, boy

[Verse 2: Star]
Your swag is on a million
You're the only one I think about when I be on tour
OMG, what you do to me
You're the only one I dream about and I can barely sleep
Ooh, ooh, baby
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Star]
We can be more than temporary (More than temporary)
Love you everyday like February (Love)
I'm tryna make us so official, like
Ooh, ah (Ooh), ooh, ah

[Chorus: Beauty & Star]
You're nothin' like them other boys (Boys), lover boy (Boys)
And that's why I love you, boy
You're nothin' like them other boys, lover boy

[Verse 3: Babydoll, Beauty & Star]
When you're not here I feel incomplete (Incomplete)
Swear, you make these other boys so obsolete (Ooh, woah, woah)
They do not compare, no, they can't compete (Can't compete)
But let God lead, we can't force, what it shouldn't be, shouldn't be (Ooh, woah, woah)
It the wrong generation for a love life (Love life)
Everybody wanna gang, hollerin', "Thug life" (Thug life)
Give a damn what you be under the lime light (Lime light)
Get your spirit and your heart and your mind right (And your mind right)
No lil' boy shit, grown woman
Ain't got no time if you can't treat me
I'm gang gifted 'til you love one of them lame bitches
I'm straight (Ooh, woah, woah)
