Hey boy

Hey boy
When we first met
On the 31st
And it was Halloween
You know what I mean

(and) I was the one dressed up
As a rocket
That night
Please, please
Don't ask me why

Hey boy
Hey boy

You came over me
And said
"Tell me
If you're alone tonight
Can I be by your side?"
Hey baby, ain't we having fun
Tonight
Little rocket in the sky
Little rocket in the sky
Tell me ­ Pa pa da da pa pa da da…

I'm a rocket in the sky

Baby baby
Ain't we having fun tonight
I'll be by yourside
I'll be by yourside

Baby baby
I've been there all
Year long
Standing by the telephone
The telephone

Hey baby
If you care for me
Why don't you call
And give me some dignity
Some decency
Rocket in disguise
Rocket in disguise
Don't ask me why
Don't ask me why

I'm a rocket in disguise
Don't ask me why
I'm a rocket in disguise
Don't ask me why
Tell me
Ba da da da …
I'm a rocket in disguise
Ba da da da …
Hey boy
Hey boy
Hey boy
