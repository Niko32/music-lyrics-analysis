I heard from reliable sources
About a gentle young cat named John Piano
Had a brush with supernatural forces

They said it was all in his head
That night found John Piano dead

Well, John Piano's band played on
And they began to speculate
About what kind of evil thing
Took their freind to an early grave

The guitar player passed away
The blood from his corpse had been drained

The band played on solemnly
As the bodycount was doubled
Strange reports of creatures lurking in the swamp
They smelled trouble

The drummer found herself accused of a horrible killing spree
Now the bass player has been found hanging by his neck from an old dead tree

T'was a swinging scene in New Orleans
Or so my sources have said
About a gentle young cat named John Piano
Who's entire band would end up dead

Nobody left alive to cry
