Joseph & Joe
The priest and the cowboy
The places they've been to
The places they're in
For a time between storms
On the side of a mountain
With another man's family
A family of friends

Joseph can give you
The keys to the kingdom
He'll put you in touch with
The spirit of man
Joe love the desert
But lives in the mountains
His closest companion
A left-handed man

Where do you go
If you've got no way to get there
Where do you go
How do you know
If you've never ever been there
How do you know
Tell me how do you know
You might also likeJoseph I lost you
In some other city
Our paths and our crossing
Were way out of time
Joe how the seasons
Have drifted between us
Or is it your vision
Much greater then mine

Take head of the darkness
Which gathers around us
A fire that consumes us
Forever to burn
Then look to the surf
For our father is with us
Our mother will teach us
What we need to learn

Where do you go
If you've got no way to get there
Where do you go
How do you know
If you've never ever been there
How do you know
Tell me how do you know
Tell me where do you go
If you've got no way to get there
Where do you go
How do you know
If you've never ever been there
How do you know
Tell me how do you know
