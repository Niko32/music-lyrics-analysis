Aouh, eenie, meenie, miny, moe
It's alright to take me out
It's okay to buy me flowers
You can even brag about
How we sat and laughed for hours
But you are not the only one
Who is giving me attention
There's another guy
And I don't wanna lie to you
That's why I need to know who's to go
Eenie, meenie, miny, moe
Gotta show everything about you
That's why I need to know who's to go
Eenie, meenie, miny, moe
Let me know everything about you
One of you is Mr. Right
The other one is left of middle
I don't wanna see you fight
Now this is what I gotta settle
If I have to make a choice
I wanna know some more about you
So promise to be true
'Cause I know love is meant for two
That's why I need to know who's to go
Eenie, meenie, miny, moe
Gotta show everything about you
That's why I need to know who's to go
Eenie, meenie, miny, moe
Let me know everything about you
All I want is someone honest
Let me know if you can make a promise
If you'll always be there for me
I'm here waiting for you
