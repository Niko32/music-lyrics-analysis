It's pulling my heart out, the perfect day
The feeling that nothing could take this away
Oh, if we had a message, I think it got lost
Maybe I'm closer now, than we ever got

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah you'll find me where I lay, always
Was something switching off? Did I miss it?

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel like following
Following my heart again
Don't feel like listening, listening
Or playing that part again
Oh, if we had a message (Message)
I think it got lost (Got lost)
Turning right back around (Message)
I could be something more than all this (Got lost)

[Verse 2]
Tearing up silence, killing time
Drinking our feelings on it, tasted like wine
Oh if we had a message, I think it got lost
But I'm feeling closer now, than we ever got
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah you'll find me where I lay, always
Was something switching off? Did I miss it?

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel like following, following
Following my heart again
Don't feel like listening, listening
Or playing that part again
Oh, if we had a message (Message)
I think it got lost (Got lost)
Turning right back around (Message)
I could be something more than all this (Got lost)

[Bridge]
All we ever wanted was to have what we had
Never what I wanted for it to get this bad
Oh now baby, the sweetest little sting
I can't stomach the things my memory sings

[Chorus]
Oh, I feel like following, following
Following my heart again
Don't feel like listening, listening
Or playing that part again
Oh, if we had a message (Message)
I think it got lost (Got lost)
Turning right back around (Message)
I could be something more than all this (Got lost)
