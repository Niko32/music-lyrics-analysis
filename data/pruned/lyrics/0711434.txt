Lovers accustomed to tragedy
See every kiss in the window across the street
Breezes and blessings passin' by, oh

I'm in the shade of the dogwood tree
Not the one where you told your name to me
Two hungry blackbirds land nearby, oh

[Chorus 1]
If I could be over you when the sky starts fallin'
Would you be happy under me?
If I could be under you if the Earth was burnin'
Could you be trusted over me?

[Verse 2]
Spoke to a mother whose baby drowned
Gave me advice, or a rumor she once heard
"Heaven's a distance, not a place," oh

Gave her an ear from the corn we grew
You were away but she gave her thanks to you
That was a year ago come May, oh

[Chorus 2]
If I could be over you when the sky starts fallin'
Would you be smothered under me?
If I could be under you if the Earth was burnin'
Would you be cryin' over me?
You might also like[Verse 3]
I could hear kids in the yard next door
Cats in the brush when the calendar fell down
Wait by the shade-tree one more year, oh

Poetry tempered with tragedy
Tempted and pulled when you cry upon my sleeve
Two flocks of blackbirds meet the air, oh

[Chorus 1]
If I could be over you when the sky starts fallin'
Would you be happy under me?
If I could be under you if the Earth was burnin'
Could you be trusted over me?
