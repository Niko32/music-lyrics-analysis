Of life that I love so
But I can see the clouds are gatherin'
And the storm will wreck our home
For last night he hugged you tightly
And you didn't even shove
But I was wrong for I've been watching (watching you)
From the window up above
You must have thought that I was sleeping
And I wish that I had been
But I guess it's best to know you
And the way your heart can spin
I thought we belonged together
And our hearts fit like a glove
But I was wrong for I've been watching (watching you)
From the window up above
--- Instrumental ---
From my eyes the teardrops started
As I listened on and on
I heard you whisper to him softly
That our marriage was all wrong
But I hope he makes you happy
And you will never lose his love
I was wrong, I was watching (watching you)
From the window up above
How I wished I could be dreaming
And wake up to the love that's true
I was wrong for I was watching (watching you)
