And that's how I'll always be, no matter if it's right or wrong
Chasin rainbows that I can't seem to catch a hold of
Living life like it was just another song
No the nightlife ain't no good life, but it's my life
Often times the road to nowhere just leads right on back to me
Yeah and sometimes I'm so lonesome I could cry
But I guess that just the way it's gotta be
So it's one more show right here in Tyler, Texas
It's another gig in Houston and the next night San Antone
Just another smoky barroom in Mt. Pleasant
Where 85 seems like a million miles from home
Well I guess I'll be chasin rainbows til I'm gone
My mama thinks it's crazy how I'm livin
My woman she believes in me, just as long as I'm at home
But I can't help but feel like I should be here singing
I'd rather die than see the day they prove me wrong
So it's one more drunken redneck yellin "freebird"
It's another trip to Austin for a measly hundred bones
Just another girl that felt compelled to flash us
One more drink and she'll be ready to take home
Well I guess I'll be chasin rainbows til I'm gone
When you're younger they all say "the sky's the limit"
But when you're older, how their tunes all seem to change
Try to tell you how they think you should be livin
But it won't do them no good, don't put this freebird in a cage
So it's one more little bar in College Station
It's another dirty hotel sending my love through the phone
Then it's just another stage in Gainesville, TX
37 city limit signs from home
Well I guess I'll be chasin rainbows til I'm goneYou might also like
