No one's ever matched the feeling that I've known in loving you
In the winds I've heard you whisper it has sparkled in the dew
I finally learned my destination and all my roads lead back to you

All my roads lead back to you
All my roads lead back to you
It's made no difference where I go or what I do
All my roads lead back to you

I've climbed up life's highest mountain and I've come down the other side
Every rainbow ends in nothing dreams can't take you for a ride
Maybe cause I'm gettin' older or I'm finally gettin' wise
All my thoughts turn to exploring the country hidden in your eyes

All my roads lead back to you
All my roads lead back to you
It's made no difference where I go or what I do
All my roads lead back to you

All my roads lead back to you
All my roads lead back to you
It's made no difference where I go or what I do
All my roads lead back to you...You might also like
