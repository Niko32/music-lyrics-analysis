I'm bound to give my heart away
When I do
It's for you love, true love
Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true
It's for you

They said that love was a lie
And I never should try to find

Somebody who'd be kind
Kind to only me

Love comes love goes
I give my heart and no one knows
That I do
It's for youYou might also like
