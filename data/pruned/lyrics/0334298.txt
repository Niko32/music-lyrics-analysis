Well she's just waiting for the summertime when the weather's fine
She could hitch a ride out of town and so far away from that
Low down, good for nothin'
Mistake-makin' fool with excuses like
"Baby that was a long time ago"
But that's just a euphemism, if you want the truth
He was out of control
But a short time's a long time when your mind just won't let it go

[Verse 2]
Well summer came along and it then was gone and so was she
But not from him because he followed her just to let her know
A dream's a dreams
And all this livin's so much harder than it seems
But girl, don't let your dreams be dreams
You know this livin's not so hard as it seems
Don't let your dreams be dreams
Your dreams be dreams
And be dreamsYou might also like
