Oh, and the weather is lovely in LA tonight
I mean you know I had to... put the... you know...
Ahahahaha...
JUPE!

[Hook]
Right back to the Panera
Push myself like pills ’til I’m pushing that Carrera
Fuck around and got starstruck looking in the mirror
Fucked the girl of my dreams and got the fuck up out of there
You know
I’d probably fuck your bitch and fuck up your career
You know
I’d probably fuck your bitch and fuck up your career

[Verse 1]
You better fit me in your fuckin’ plans
Bad bitch, and we got fuckin’ plans
It’s going down like Egyptian governments
You get right here, she gon’ eat from the other end
I’m Gucci now, Versace Versace
All these tracks, ah, fuck I’m supposed to hide these bodies?
Bad bitches, drunk as hell, screamin’ in the lobby
Pulled up in that skrrt! pulled off, niggas barely saw me
Apologize for your style, cause you very sorry
I call my Catholic bitches up and have a merry party
I feel like ‘fuck it, I’ma be the life of every party’
I ain’t just anybody, this shit ain’t for everybody

[Verse 2]
But you know
She another girl when she off the L, Nuvo
Taking selfies like she posin’ for the fuckin’ new Vogue
I pull one, then pull my cash out and I pull two mo'
But you know
In this cold world, you can never know who you know
I do it to the death my nigga, then I do mo'
I do it to the death, then it’s Jean Toutou
But you know
You know
You know

[Bridge]
Then it’s back to the Panera
Push myself like pills
’Til I’m pushing that Carrera
Yeah
But you know
