Look me in the eyes, while I make love to you, girl
I wanna see your face, I wanna know you feel it
And I won't be surprised, because I know I feel it too, girl
And I ain't into keeping secrets anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I already know you love it, babe
But sometimes I just wanna hear you say "yeah" (Yeah)
I want you to tell me just how good it feels tonight

[Chorus]
You scream when you're fed up
You scream when you're sick and tired, baby
You scream when you packed your bags and you walked up out the door
(So let me hear you now)
Scream 'cause it feels good
Scream, girl, 'cause we're making love like crazy
Scream when you're calling my name out and you're beggin' me for more
Let me hear ya (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Let me hear ya (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
Tell me that it's mine
Tell me you'll do it again, I wanna hear it right now, baby
Make it up to daddy, 'cause you've been a bad girl, yeah
Tell me I'm the man, tell me, baby, "Yeah, it's all yours"
That's what I need to hear right now from you, girl
