Was the time I tried to kill a man
Just for looking at me wrong
Anger so strong, I couldn't stop myself

[Verse 2]
But I was killing myself one shot at a time
Going insane from the pain
The women and the wine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I finally hit bottom in an alley way
Hell wasn't but a breath away
So I hit my knees in the street
And begged god for mercy, yeah

[Chorus]
Last night
I told the devil where to go
You know heaven's got my soul
Ain't gonna listen to his lies no more
Last night, I told the devil where to go

[Verse 3]
I coulda saved myself a lot of hurting time
If I'd have just listened to my momma
Every time she cried
You might also like[Verse 4]
Well I was way to lost in a sinner's haze
Burning up the days
Just another young man
Who had lost his way

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now it finally makes sense what the preacher said
When he said son you don't wanna wake up dead
And find yourself alone in the fires of hell

[Chorus]
Yeah everybody, last night
I told the devil where to go
You know heaven's got my soul
Ain't gonna listen to his lies no more
Last night I told the devil where to go

[Bridge]
Now when you hear that demon knocking at your door
You just tell him
You don't want his kind round here no more, no

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Cause if you wanna love if you wanna live
If you wanna be free you can't forget and forgive
You gotta kick him in the teeth
And do exactly, do exactly what I did
[Chorus]
Yeah, last night
I told the devil where to go
You know heaven's got my soul
Ain't gonna listen to his lies no more

[Outro]
Last night I told the devil
Last night I told the devil
Last night I told the devil
Last night I told the devil
Last night I told the devil
I told the devil where to go
