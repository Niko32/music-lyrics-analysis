And her heart was shining like stars
But her life was short like butterflies
That she had lost in the war of shame

A little child in the cold and dark
A silent cry in this merciless game
Now echoing on the streets
And you hear kalihora's song

This new world face true pains
Children cry with endless rain
Now echoing on the streets
And you hear kalihora's song

Avelar herenis o nira
Beribent senthura suhr havelora
Nerha ven'hu theraYou might also like
