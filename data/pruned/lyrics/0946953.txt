Stars would shine on stormy nights
Flowers grew in winter time
Everything seemed possible
When we were in love

[Chorus]
When forever was what other people lost
This lonesome valley was what other people crossed
No, I couldn't taste the tears other people shed
When goodbye was a word other people said

[Verse 2]
Rivers flowed
A bridge would burn
And nights would end
The earth still turned
Yesterday was just a song to sing
In the world we knew

[Chorus]
When forever was what other people lost
This lonesome valley was what other people crossed
No, I couldn't taste the tears other people shed
When goodbye was a word other people said
You might also like[Outro]
When goodbye was a word other people said
