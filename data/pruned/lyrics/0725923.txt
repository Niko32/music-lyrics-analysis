"...is a song that I wrote for Jimmy Newman...(He never did get around
To recording it.) I get a chance to play the harmonica on this one"

[Verse 1:]
Well, I'm coming to the party tonight
I've been wrong so long I get right
I'm gonna let my hair down and don't you think I might
'Cause I'm coming to the party tonight

[Chorus:]
Coming to the party tonight
And I'll find someone new to hold me tight
She thinks I'm home crying won't she be surprised
'Cause I'm coming to the party tonight

[Verse 2:]
Well, I'm coming to the party tonight
New arms a new love a new life
So don't you shake my tree if you don't like your peaches ripe
'Cause I'm coming to the party tonight
