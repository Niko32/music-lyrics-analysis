I feel the dark side crawling in
I suck it in with joyful grin
I breath inside and keep it there
This darkness I will not share

Were you with the ones who left me here with nothing more to fear
I sense the pain and taste the blood
I yearn for pain that leaves no scars

Deep down in my darkness
Unrighteous dimension of despair

I hit myself against the wall
I hit myself I beat me raw
On the floor I cannot move
In my darkest hour the time has stood

Don't you touch me don't you dare
To brake this silence with words of care
Unspeakable
Unbarrallelled
My universe, my darkest cell

Deep down in my darkness
Unrighteous dimension of despair
