[Verse 1]
Well, it's 10 o'clock, Jewel, Jewel
And it's time to see you
Scan around the block, ooh, you Jewel
In the monitor screen
I can usually find you near 42nd and 8th
A whore in a doorway, yeah
I think I've found you, ooh, Jewel
With my TV beam

[Verse 2]
You know it's funny, but the light in the night
Does something to your face
And the way you look reminds me of
A girl that I used to want in junior high
The smile on your lips and the shape of your hips
Excites me and it makes me wanna touch you
You're a whore for sure, but that's okay
'Cause I'm nothing, just another dirty spy
With a TV eye

[Bridge]
I can't stand it when you find a man
I wonder what he's sayin'
Does he tell you 'bout his wife and kids at home?
Is he all alone like me?
The one who's always watching you
In the night, in the night
Watching you in the night, in the night

[Verse 3]
Well, you're back on the street, and I can love you
As a man can love a woman
And you know I'm here, but you think of me
As a steel machine

[Outro]
But I'm watching you all night
And I'm watching you all night long
And I'm watching you all night
And I'm watching you all night long
And I'm watching you all night
And I'm watching you all night long
And I'm watching you all night
And I'm watching you all night long
And I'm watching you all night...
