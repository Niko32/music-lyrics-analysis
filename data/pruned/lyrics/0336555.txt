I fed the children
And I kissed them goodnight
You fed the jukebox
Until they turn out the lights
I bought the bacon
While you bought the booze

[Chorus]
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose

[Verse 2]
Needing new clothes with the money you spent
On barbills and motels and women you met
But I stood the heartache that you put me through

[Chorus]
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose

[Verse 3]
I gave up so much
And now I'm giving up you
It's too late to make up for
The love that you used

[Bridge]
I've had enough
I don't want you around
Don't look at me
Like I let you down
You say I'm to blame
But who's fooling who
You might also like[Chorus]
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose
I've sacrificed more than you'll ever lose
