Miss can we dance real slow
With the lights down low
I wanna play ya body like a drum
And serenade you with my guitar strums
I wanna see you on the floor girl
Come and shake it for the whole world
You can play the lead in my video
You're my superstar no one can take ya role

[Hook]
Every Dee-Jay
Make this the last request at your part-ay
While the playas try to spit at them shawt-ays
So we can get outta here
So keep it spinning, if you spin we win

[Chorus]
I need ya body right here
So we can cut in slow motion
Bring ya body right here
You know I got that love potion
I need ya body right here
I'm good to the last drop, I'm like Folgers
So come and bring ya body right here
We be doin it over & over, & over & over again
You might also like[Verse 2]
When we play Hide-n-Go-Seek
Bet I can find your love right under those sheets
I'll do thangs that your man won't do
'Cause you're more precious than a treasured jewel

Here's the keys to my world girl
I'll take you on a World Tour with me girl
All you gotta do is
Tell me that you want it
Won't you come and get it
All you gotta do is say yes and you got it girl

[Hook]
Every Dee-Jay
Make this the last request at your part-ay
While the playas try to spit at them shawt-ays
So we can get outta here
So keep it spinning, if you spin we win

[Chorus]
I need ya body right here
So we can cut in slow motion
Bring ya body right here
You know I got that love potion
I need ya body right here
I'm good to the last drop, I'm like Folgers
So come and bring ya body right here
We be doin it over & over, & over & over again
(Repeat 3x)
Can I play with ya body like a drum, all night long
Can I play with ya body like a drum, all night long, all night long

[Chorus]
