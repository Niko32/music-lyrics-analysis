[Intro]
I'd like to reintroduce myself
Haha
If you don't know by now
It's Obie Trice, man

[Verse 1]
I came from nothin', solo
Straight outta the dumpster, hobo
Made him a monster, I was cultivatingly slanging that coco
Hated the po-po, locally known as abominable snow-o
Later the big 4 rated the home where I made the dough grow
So on and so fo', the story of us urban negros
Created as equals we wouldn't have to be so eager to mistreat you
We as a people, heated in the evenings, doing these evils
Gotta eat to be cool, got a kid to feed, did it reach you?
Or did it seep through?
Or do I just speak through the EQ just to say I got a hot sequel?
When niggas on the block gotta eat, gotta cop
Gotta cop when they caught by the cops
Young 2Pac's laid in the box or they age in a cell blocks, fade away
Brick walls, steel gates, can't wait for the day to be free
That's why I'm

Seen it, I done ate it, I done shit it
Slept it, lived it
Now I spit it
Shady

[Verse 2]
Workin' that house off an no-doze
Got an ounce to roll on
Tryin' to get rid of the pounds
I gotta whip the bounce, I gotta put that chrome on
Same old song, young nigga that's trying to get some where I come from
Funds, need 'em in abundance, whole bunch
Only way a city boy function
In conjunction with selling this substance
Chips stay up, fuck it, glucks keep coming, take another pie out the oven
I'mma be hugging these corners 'till these corners corner me
Currently, I'm calculating this currency, urgency
Gotta earn a G, uphearnestly, up early when the birds'll sing
It's an emergency, never did occur to me, that the first and the third'll be
Such a thirst for me, life almost took a turn for the worst for me
Took to see I finally had a purpose on Earth's surface the seed that was birthing me
Obie gotta do a little soul searching
And Obie myself personally
And to think all Em had to hear is one verse from me
To confirm and unblur my dreams
Best believe, since burst on the scene, I'mma be here certainly
With no uncertainties, yes indeed, I'mma get this cheese
And that's why he's
[Outro]
That's why I'm
That's what made me
Haha
That's why I'm
Young black man in America
Get up and get yours, nigga
I know you struggling, man, I've been there
I see you
Get up and get yours, nigga
Ain't no looking back now
