I'm sick of wakin' up alone
Honey, I'm pleading
Let's put away the sticks and stones
Be human beings

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I have the sense to be afraid to be a fool. (Oh)
I have the sense to be afraid to be a fool. (Oh)

[Chorus]
You push me out
You push me out, again
You push me up
You push me up against a wall

[Verse 2]
You told me once your body flowed
With milk and honey
What ever happened to our boy
Inside your tummy?

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I had the sense to be afraid to be a fool (Oh)
But I'm on a fence to make you stay or to be cruel. (Oh)
You might also like[Chorus]
You push me out
You push me out, again
You push me up
You push me up against a wall

You push me out
You push me out, again
You push me up
You push me up against a wall

[Verse 3]
You perfume-covered, helpless louse:
Look on the bright side
See, every time you laugh out loud
I'm crying inside

[Pre-Chorus]
But I have the sense to be afraid to be the fool. (Oh)
Try common sense, make me believe
Believe in you

[Bridge]
'Cause, I should have known
Yeah, I should have known
Yeah, I should have known
You'd kick me hard when I'm on the ground. (Oh)
Kick me hard when I'm on the ground. (Oh)
You'd kick me hard when I'm on the ground (Oh)
Kick me hard when I'm on the ground (Oh)
[Verse 1]
I'm sick of wakin' up alone
Honey, I'm pleading
Let's put away the sticks and stones
Be human beings
