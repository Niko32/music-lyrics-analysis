Nonloka bout to leave all the ugly bitches breathless
I’m evil with the rhymes-some say i’m demented
The vandal with the strong business ethic
Bob your head side to side until you break your neck and
Act like you know, who’s in control of the game
Throwing shade clown bitch, bout to rain on your parade
Cuz i’m moving all these bitches outta my lane!
You better speed up on that freeway to catch up to me!
You stuck on the 405 while i already exit garden grove and i already past the 22 before i hit 21!
Not conceited, i’m confident!
I know i’m a female, but i’m divine like a prophet
It’s the perverted monks and wolfpack in the house
Causing mayhem and trouble in large amounts
Down for the count
You say you trust him, but i’m at your boyfriends house!
Don’t trip bitch, we ain’t fuckin just talking shit, you say you make it rain, he says you’re dry as a drought
Boring, bland and the other hand
You’re bitter and hurt because you’re man’s a fan
So before you go off and start your hating
Remember i’m with your boyfriend and i can get him to date me
WOLFPACK!!!You might also like
