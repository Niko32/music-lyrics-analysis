Let's never say good night
Everything will be alright
Everything will be alright

From monday to thrusday we waited
This weekend will be our neverland
Growing up is so overrated
It's so overrated

This is what it's like to be young
Singing loud and having fun
Hoping the sun will never rise
It will never rise

Let's all sing along
Let's never say good night
Everything will be alright
Tonight will be our night

From monday to thrusday we waited
This weekend will be our neverland
Growing up is so overrated
Dude bro, it's so overrated
