What's rolling and churning in my poor mind
Supposed to hold fast
Supposed to keep me feeling fine
But it's cookin' my goose with a cast iron noose
Can't walk a straight line, I'm runnin' on Strychnine

[Chorus]
Just can't lose these blue pill blues
Tick tock, tick tock
There goes my fuse

[Verse 2]
Nothing as dull as what's in my skull
What I'm cuttin' back is only quicker to attack
Chip on my shoulder, chip off the ol' block
Pullin' all the strings, I'm just a puppet sock

[Chorus]
Just can't lose these blue pill blues
Tick tock, tick tock
There goes my fuse
Just can't lose these blue pill blues
Tick tock, tick tock
There goes my fuseYou might also like
