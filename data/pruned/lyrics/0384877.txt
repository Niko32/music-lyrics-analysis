All the Roses are gone
And all the loves gone away
I rode the cold of the storm
But I'm here... I'm here to stay

[Verse]
I wish I was a kid again, without a problem in the world
I miss my old life and I miss my old girl
And I miss the old days, I would run around and play
Then come home just knowing everything would be okay
But, time flies in the blink of an eye
The sheets on your death bed are a wrinkle in time
And the scars on my arms are all that I have
To show the good side of bad
And I just think of everything that's on my mind
It's a messed up world, but if you're living it's fine
Positivity's key, but for me that's hard to do
Especiallly when I'm involved with you
Where the hell am I at? I just wonder where'd the rap fans go
It's cliche, but I'm bluer then a pac man ghost
And it's hard as a person when you're tryna advance
And your haters outnumber your fans

[Hook]
All the Roses are gone
And all the loves gone away
I rode the cold of the storm
But I'm here... I'm here to stay
You might also like[Verse 2]
This is my life, forget what ya'll stay
We stand on our own, but we fall the same way
I'm in the right class but I'm on the wrong plane
And I can't even fathom the mistakes ya'll made
But, that's talk for another time
It's hard to see the bright side when you're color blind
And to all the cornballs tryna stop my grind
P. Diddy couldn't stop my shine... that's what I tell 'em
They all gonna try to get me to stop
A world full of bartenders wouldn't give me a shot
So I'm walking in this world a lost soul
And I just hope that ya'll know
That the more you sleeping on me, the more you dream about me
Successfull is something you could never be without me
And change is something that could never be done
It's a battle that could never be won
