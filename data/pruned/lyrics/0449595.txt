I've got a good woman at home who thinks I do no wrong
But sometimes, Lord, she just ain't always around
And you know that's when I fall, now I can't help myself at all
And I get whiskey bent and hell bound

[Chorus 2]
Play me some songs about a ramblin' man
Put a cold one in my hand
'Cause you know I love to hear those guitar sounds
Don't you play "I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry"
'Cause I'll get all balled up inside
And I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound

[Verse 2]
Sure enough about closin' time, 'bout stoned out of my mind
And I end up with some honky tonk special I found
Just as sure as the morning sun comes, thinking of my sweet girl at home
And I need to get whiskey bent and hell bound

[Chorus 2]
Play me the songs about ramblin' man
Put old Jim Beam in my hand
'Cause you know I still love to get drunk and hear country sounds
But don't you play "Your Cheatin' Heart"
'Cause that'll tear me all apart
I'll get whiskey bent and hell bound

Yeah, old Hank's songs always make me feel low down
