Love will be the armor
Protect us from the pain
In our life, In our life
Even when the storm comes
We'll stand out in the rain
Watch it slide, let it slide

[Refrain: will.i.am & Skylar Grey]
Here we stand
Against the world

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
You and I, we rock the lullaby
Make me feel alive 'cause the love, it never die
Me put you long one, shot me down, we're foregone
Ain't no need to worry, don't call 911
Bang, bang, a lot of bang, bang
Shoot me with your lovin', but me feelin' no pain
Kill it, kill it, baby, with your lovin'
Bang, bang, baby, do it again

[Chorus: Skylar Grey, will.i.am & Skylar Grey]
So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet

Even if you're mad at me
And fighting all the time
It's alright, it's alright
I would risk my sanity
I would lose my mind
For one night, for one night

[Refrain: will.iam & Skylar Grey]
Here we stand
Against the world

[Pre-Chorus: will.i.am]
You and I, we rock the lullaby
Make me feel alive 'cause the love, it never die
Me put you long one, shot me down, we're foregone
Ain't no need to worry, don't call 911
Bang, bang, a lot of bang, bang
Shoot me with your lovin', but me feelin' no pain
Got me feelin' lovely like it's morphine
Baby, do it again

[Chorus: Skylar Grey, will.i.am & Skylar Grey]
So shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet
Such a pretty bullet, bullet, bullet
Go ahead and pull it, pull it, pull it
Shoot me with your bullet, bullet, bullet, bullet
