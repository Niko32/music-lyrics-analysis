You push me, to go the extra mile
You push me, when it's difficult to smile
You push me, a better version of myself
You push me, only you and no one else
You push me, to see the other point of view
You push me, when there's nothing else to do
You push me, when I think I know it all
You push me, when I stumble and I fall

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep on pushing (Keep on)
Like nobody (Keep on)

[Chorus]
Every race I win, every mood I'm in
Everything I do, I owe it all to you
Every move I make, every step I take
Everything I know, it's all because you push me

[Verse 2]
(You push me) When I don't appreciate
(You push me) Not to lie and not to hate
(You push me) When I want it all to end
(You push me) When I really need a friend
(You push me) All I wanna do is cry
(You push me) When it's hard for me to try
(You push me) When I do it for myself
(You push me) Only you and no one else
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Keep on pushing (Keep on)
Like nobody (Keep on)

[Chorus]
Every race I win, every mood I'm in
Everything I do, I owe it all to you
Every move I make, every step I take
Everything I do, it's all because you push me

[Post-Chorus]
You push me

[Bridge]
Keep on pushing (Keep on)
Like nobody (Keep on)
(Keep on)
(Keep on)

[Chorus]
(Every race I win) To go the extra mile
(Every mood I'm in) When it's difficult to smile
(Everything I do) A better version of myself
Only you and only you and only you
(Every move I make) To see the other point of view
(Every step I take) When there's nothing else to do
(Everything I do) When I think I know it all
Only you and only you and only you
Every race I win (To go the extra mile)
Every mood I'm in (When it's difficult to smile)
Everything I do (A better version of myself)
I owe it all to you (Only you and only you and only you)
Every move I make (To see the other point of view)
Every step I take (When there's nothing else to do)
Everything I do (When I think I know it all)
It's all because you push me
[Outro]
You push me
