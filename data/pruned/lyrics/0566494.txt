You're on the tip of a hungry tongue
You're a new name, a new name, a new name
A name that I don't know

A key locked in the back of your throat
A new name, a new name, a new name
A name I wanna know

[Bridge]
Go and say it now

[Chorus]
A name that I don't know
A secret we all hold
A name that I don't know
A secret we all hold

Who wasn't thinking it all along
What a name, a new name
A little name, a name i wanna know

Come on say it now
You want to hear me say it
You want to hear it said aloud
You might also like[Chorus x2]

[Horns]

[Outro]
You want to hear it said aloud
You want to solve a code
You want to hear it said aloud

[Chorus x2]
