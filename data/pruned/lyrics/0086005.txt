Oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah
Akon, and Sway (Sway, Sway)
(Konvict, Konvict)

[Hook: Akon]
That girl ain't no joke
I love the way she roll
Especially when she workin', goin' up and down that pole
Cuz she's a professional and she'll stick you up without a weapon
Oh, she's so cold
If you don't know, she'll rob you for your silver and gold (gold, gold, gold, gold, gold)
She will take it and go (go, go, go, go, go)
For your silver and gold (gold, gold, gold, gold, gold)
She will take it and go (go, go, go, go, go)
If you don't know...

[Verse 1: Sway]
Just hopped off a plane
Name just popped up again
UK just got hot again
Konvict Music, top for the game
I'm in the club and I'm watchin' a dame
Who's in love cuz she's watchin', the watchin' the chain
And where there is drop over range
One thing is for sure
It's the top of the range
Clubs about to close
Follow me to my crib, come without your clothes
Most girls are happy with a rose
She rather have bottles of Rosé, Hennessy and mo'
She's out for the dough
She'll bounce for anyone with an account full of 0’s
Got bounced from anyone when her account gets low
'Cos money, money, money makes the girls get low

[Verse 2: Sway]
Yeah, I'm on the beat
Got the whole club feelin' like Rio on the beach
She got them pretty Louis V upon her feet
And she loves me cuz im a CEO of my team
And she could tell where you came
Runnin' with Akon but I ain't T-Pain
Get a little change, but I exchange pounds
Make it thunder in the club, who da hell needs rain
Baby love glamour she ain't never been played
She loves London but she ain't never been Spain
She's always tellin' me how much she loves my accent
But she's thinkin' to herself, "What the hell is he saying?"
Yeah she's out for the dough
She'll bounce for anyone with an account full of 0’s
Got bounced from anyone when her account gets low
Cuz money, money, money makes the girls get low

[Bridge: Akon]
If you never been exposed
You better be
Ready for this type of woman
Cuz shes outta your league
I watched her make the most powerful men just crawl on their knees
Beggin' for mercy
