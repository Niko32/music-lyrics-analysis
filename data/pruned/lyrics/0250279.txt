When I was in the Feds,I told T.I how I came up
In and out of jail my whole life,ready to change up
Blessed with the gift of spitting fire with the flame up
I told when I touched,I'd help him tear the game up!!!

Verse(2)King Hearns
King Status Ent.certified and sworn in it
Came out my mothers womb wearing a crown,I was born in it
The Storm ended a month ago,forecast been real sunny
A lot of things I can't do no more,but people say I'm acting funny
Tip told me all of this would happen,but don't feed into to it
Letting go is hard some time,but some times you have to do it
Blew some opportunites in the past,never again...
I was in the pen,working out to "ALL I DO IS WIN"
With a grin on my face like the "JOKERS FACE"
That's a part of my bluff game, "POKERS FACE"
I know when to Hold,I know when to Fold
I don't ride for anything but when I go I go!
Yeah! He showed me Love,Yeah!I showed him Love
Yeah! two Kings one place,that's what it was!

(Hook)-King Hearns
When I was in the Feds,I told T.I how I came up
In and out of jail my whole life,ready to change up
Blessed with the gift of spitting fire with the flame up
I told when I touched,I'd help him tear the game up!!!You might also like
