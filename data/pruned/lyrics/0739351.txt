Thats word to my G-Code
Fuck my ex I'm single
I got a new fit so I'm flee though
And I came in here to spend money tonight
And you know that we ballin'
We gonna turn the club into a garden
Smoke a lot of hookah with a foreign
Ain't looking at my phone I'm single tonight
Oh baby, it's lit
I'm too off the shits
Got me talking my shit
I came in here to get litty tonight

[Verse 1]
Thought I told ya'll
I'm single stop talking bout my old jawn
It was cool though I remember those days
But bitch I'm right back to my old ways
Now look at all the models up in here
And look at all the bottles in the air
Don't leave your girl around me nigga
You playing forreal nigga, she probably in here nigga
I'm a pretty motherfucker you know it
All this shmoney in my pocket I blow it
Her old nigga too boring
So I started spitting G like a poet
Look, this is my party you could come if you want to
I just call up the homies they gonna roll up a blunt too
So light up the hookah blow the stress in the air
And let them keep talking man we don't even care
Tell the DJ play my song
We gonna party all night long
Ima turn off my phone
I'm in my zone tryna see who I'm taking home

See me lit now she won't leave me alone
Somebody tell her that it's slow
She let me go now everything's a go
And Rudy just called he bouta light up a fifty
Chug got the free we here with JayO and Ricky
Booby got bottles he tryna fuck with some kitties
I said don't worry bout nothing nigga just pull up with liquor
We in the spot taking henny shots
Feeling bopped with the squad
Ya'll niggas know us
But who the fuck are ya'll
I won't say much cause we don't talk a lot
And we just tryna get litty tonight
So drink up got more where that came from
And pour out a little for my day ones
These niggas talking but they ain't really saying nothing
If you don't like me don't smile in my face, son
We 150, all my niggas is 150
Don't tell me come if my niggas can't come with me
We screaming "KuKu" through the whole city
And we dont love these hoes nigga they all iffy
[Hook]
