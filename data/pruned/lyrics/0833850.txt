Your daddy was a Sergeant Major
You didn't wanna, but he made you
Wipe his brass from time to time
It left a picture in your mind
You know? You know?

[Chorus]
You want it all, you want it all
All or nothin', you want it all

[Verse 2]
Here am I, a fallen arrow
My load is wide, my street is narrow
My skin is thicker, my heart is tougher
I don't mind workin', but I'm scared to suffer
You know? You know?

[Chorus]
You want it all, you want it all
All or nothin', you want it all or nothin'

[Verse 3]
Sweet chariots of L.A. swing low
At twilight time, the smog makes a rainbow
So keep one eye on the weather
You had it good, you wanted better
You know? You know?
You might also like[Chorus]
You want it all, you want it all
All or nothin', you want it all
All or nothin', nothin', all
All or nothin', nothin', woah
You want it all, you want it all
All or nothin', nothin', nothin' no
All or nothin'
