Start a little revolution come with me
We are good to change us wish.............again
Come together real voice sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
We Are Everything and everyone is another time
Open up your eyes, I've got a part, you pull up sunshine
There it is, there it is, that magical feelings
There it is, there it is, that magical feelings

Love is power, love is colour of light
Love can break true although change that fight
We are all injury people now that try to shine
Come together real voice sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
We Are Everything and everyone is another time
Open up your eyes, I've got a part, you pull up sunshine
There it is, there it is, that magical feelings
There it is, there it is, that magical feelings
