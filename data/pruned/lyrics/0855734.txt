If i had a thousand lives to choose from
But we don't change
What we don't see
Because we affect each other endlessly

And i see between your eyes
Lines of language to be taken alone
I came in from the mountain

My fears would change over centuries
If i could choose a thousand lives to live from
But we can't change
What we can't see
Because we affect each other endlessly

And i see between your eyes
Lines of language, to be taken alone
I came in from the mountain

And i see between your eyes
Lines of language, to be taken alone
I came in from the mountain
Oh i came in from the mountainYou might also like
