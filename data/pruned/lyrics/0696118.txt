There's a road in Oklahoma
Straighter than a preacher
Longer than a memory
And it goes forever onward
It's been a good teacher
For a lot of country boys like me

[Verse]
I push that load from here to someday
I'll push as long as I'm alive
But I don't know how long I'll last
Because it's just a road, it ain't no highway
I'm blowing by the double five
I know I'm going way too fast

[Chorus]
I've been down this road just searching for the end
It don't go nowhere, it just brings you back again
Leaves you lonely and cold, standing on the shoulder
But you've come too far to go back home
So you're walking on a nowhere road

[Verse 2]
Some folks say, if you keep rolling
And you keep it on the yellow line
It'll take you on the big highway
But there's a toll to pay, if you're going
The keeper at the gate is blind
So you better be prepared to pay
You might also like[Chorus]
I've been down this road just searching for the end
It don't go nowhere, it just brings you back again
Leaves you lonely and cold, standing on the shoulder
But you've come too far to go back home
So you're walking on a nowhere road
