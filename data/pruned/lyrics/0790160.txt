You can tell a lot about a man
By the woman he loves
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul
Like she does
And she'd be the one to swear that he hung
The moon above
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man
By the woman he loves

She knows him inside out
The things he dreams about
And makes them come true when she can
She know all of his faults
The demons he's fought
With nothin' but his hard-working' hands

And he calls out her name
In passion and pain
She makes him stronger each time
Yeah it's there on her lips
And her fingertips
That she's with him to 'till end of the line

2nd Chorus:
(Yeah) You can tell a lot about a man
By the woman he loves (yes you can)
'Cause nothing else shows a part of his soul
Like she does
And she'd be the one to swear the he hung
The moon above
Yeah you can tell a lot about a man
By the woman he loves
