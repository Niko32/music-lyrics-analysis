You gave all your love, and she didn't give it back
Tossed it like a quarter on a rusty railroad track
Underneath the hurt I see the real you
I look into your eyes and all I wanna do

[Chorus]
I wanna give you the kind of kiss that makes you stop missing her
I wanna hold you in my arms, just let me be that girl
The blue sky puzzle piece that fits the empty heart
Let me fix your broken heart, let me fix your broken heart

[Verse 2]
Last time you feel so hard that you're scared to leave the ground
I knew you could love me, but I know you don't know how
To let yourself take another chance
Boy, you don't even know the good thing that you have

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The blue sky puzzle piece that fits the empty part

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Let me fix your broken heart
Let me fix your broken heart
Let me fix your broken heartYou might also like
