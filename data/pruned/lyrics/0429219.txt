Still, water runs the deepest
Like a love complete and true
So peaceful and dependable
I can't say the same about you

[Verse 2]
Your love is cold and selfish
And it never could be true
One time, I loved you truly
I can't say the same about you

[Verse 3]
I'm leaving and I won't be back
I'm going where I belong
Too long we've been together
And too long you've done me wrong

[Verse 4]
Still, water runs the deepest
Like a love complete and true
So peaceful and dependable
I can't say the same about you

[Verse 5]
Well I'm leaving and I won't be back
I'm going where I belong
Too long we've been together
And too long you've done me wrong

Still, water runs the deepest
Like a love complete and true
So peaceful and dependable
I can't say the same about you
