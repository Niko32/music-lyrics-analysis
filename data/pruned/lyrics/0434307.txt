Another night and you been knocking at my window
I wouldn't answer if I took my own advice
You gave me something that I wanted to believe in
I give up hope when every moment goes by
But much to my surprise
It feels incredible each time I see you smiling
And every winter you're the apple of my eye
You fed my soul when I shouldn't let you feed it
You gave me something that was missing in my life

[Hook]
Oh baby
You are the one for me
Your love is haunting me
And I'm a willing house
Oh I'm an empty house

[Chorus]
Every fear's for here
Is it worth it to me
But we keep on lying to ourselves
Cause we're ashamed not to move
Oh, little lies on me
Is it worth it to me?
When we keep on lying to ourselves
Cause we're ashamed not to move
You might also like[Hook x 2]
Oh baby
You are the one for me
Your love is haunting me
And I'm a willing house
Oh I'm an empty house

[Chorus]
Every fear's for here
Is it worth it to me
But we keep on lying to ourselves
Cause we're ashamed not to move
Oh, little lies on me
Is it worth it to me?
When we keep on lying to ourselves
Cause we're ashamed not to move
