I feel my wings have broken in your hands
I feel the words unspoken inside
And they pull you under

[Pre-Chorus]
And I will give you anything you want, oh
You are all I wanted
All my dreams are fallen down
Crawlin' around and 'round and 'round

[Chorus]
Somebody save me
Let your warm hands break right through it
Somebody save me
I don't care how you do it, just stay, stay
C'mon, I've been waiting for you

[Verse 2]
I see the world has folded in your heart
I feel the waves crash down inside
And they pull me under

[Pre-Chorus]
I would give you anything you want, oh
You are all I wanted
All my dreams have fallen down
Crawlin' around and around and around...
You might also like[Chorus]
Somebody save me
Let your warm hands break right through it
Somebody save me
I don't care how you do it, just stay, stay
C'mon, I've been waiting for you

[Bridge]
All my dreams are on the ground
Crawlin' around and around...

[Chorus (variation)]
Somebody save me
Let your warm hands break right through
Somebody save me
I don't care how you do it, just stay with me
I made this whole world shine for you
Just stay, stay
C'mon, I'm still waiting for you
