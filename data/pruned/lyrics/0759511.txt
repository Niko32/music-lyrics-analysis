And it doesn't tell me nothing at all
That face of the clock just stares at me
It knows I'm lonely and always will be

I want to cry my heart out
Want my baby back with me
Got nothing but time to step out
But time means nothing to me

If you hear me, please come back real soon
'Cause the clock and I are so lonely in this room
Instrumental break
I want to cry my heart out

Want my baby back to me
Got nothing but time to step out
But time means nothing to me
If you hear me, please come back real soon
