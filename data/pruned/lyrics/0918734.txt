On the hillside where we once lay
Are all dead and gone
But there's still the song that we used to sing
And now
There's a loose cat on your windowsill
And she's looking pale, oh, she's looking thin
She'd love to come inside
Oh, she'd love to be inside

One false move
There's someone else beside her
One false move
You're a paper tiger

She swallows every move you make
With a shock of fur and electric purr
She rubs against your leg
Her lips
They are chapped and they are trembling
With a desperate need, so simple to read
She's love them to be read
Oh, she'd love them to be read

One false move
There's someone else beside her
One false move
You're a paper tiger
You're a paper tiger
You're a paper tiger
You might also likeNow you've got the moves
We embrace you
In case you did not notice a thing
There are more of us than there are of you
You better talk the line like I told you to

The trees
On the hillside where we once lay
Are all dead and gone
But there's still the song that we used to sing
And now
There's a loose cat on your windowsill
And she's looking pale, oh, she's looking thin
She'd love to come inside
Oh, she'd love to be inside

One false move
There's someone else beside her
One false move
You're a paper tiger [x7]
