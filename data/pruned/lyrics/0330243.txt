And you lock the house
To keep your secret from coming out
I won't, no
I'm sorry because you're old news

[Pre-Chorus]
And my life is holding our heads to this gun
You and your new boy
Think you can come in and keep me off
But you're wrong

[Chorus]
I find myself on the street out in front of your house
You can kiss safe thoughts goodbye
I'm coming up to break your heart
You're sleeping with the light on
Like you're dying to be found out

[Verse]
And you lock the house
To keep your secret from coming out
I won't, no
I'm sorry because you're old news

[Pre-Chorus]
And my life is holding our heads to this gun
You and your new boy
Think you can come in and keep me off
But you're wrong
You might also like[Chorus]
I find myself on the street out in front of your house
You can kiss safe thoughts goodbye
I'm coming up to break your heart
You're sleeping with the light on
Like you're dying to be found out

I find myself on the street out in front of your house
You can kiss safe thoughts goodbye
I'm coming up to break your heart
You're sleeping with the light on
Like you're dying to be found out

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, o-oh
And you lock the house
And you lock the house, oh
And you lock the house
And you lock the house, oh
