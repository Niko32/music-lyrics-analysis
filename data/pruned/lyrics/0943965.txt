Talk is cheap and I can just about afford this sentence
What can I do? Maybe I could deal in actions, yeah
I could sell you this finger, maybe you would get the message

Get out, get out

Is this about blame? Is this about corruption, baby?
Is this about hypocrisy? ‘Cause I'm pretty good at that
I seem to have this knack of using silence as a shotgun
'Til you reach between your legs and draw a weapon of your own

Saying, get out, get out

And these days, you guys, you really owe me one
And I’m just about to cash in my favour
For a shoulder to cry on

Well, this is my plan and this is my idea
If we turn the world around at least we’ll have something new to look at and
No-one told me that you always won a bet you will just
Keep playing those straights
You seem to play them slightly crooked

I say get out, get out
You might also likeAnd these days, you guys, you really owe me one
I’m just about to cash in my favour
For a shoulder to cry on

Well, my mouth is so full from all the shit you’re making me swallow
And I'll bet you my first time I can still scream when I want to
And the king of the mice is living it up with the rat clan
It's got something to do with love or passion or something

Get out, get out
Get out, get out
