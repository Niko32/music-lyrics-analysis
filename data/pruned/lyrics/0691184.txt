He blew in town at midnight
And he didn't mean to stay
And then he found her
Just at closing time at the Alamo Cafe
And the way he smiled and carried on
He kinda made her day
So by the time that she left
He left with her
And she let him borrow money
And she let him drive her car
She didn't really trust him
But she done and gone too far

[Chorus]
When the midnight moon is shining
When it's shining down the way
Well, if he blew in on the midnight wind
He may never pass this way again

[Verse 2]
She knew down in her heart
That he would only stay awhile
But sometimes she was a woman
And sometimes she was a child
Then just about the time
That she was learning how to smile
One Tuesday night
He came up missing
And sometimes now she thinks
She hears his footsteps cross the floor
But it's just that midnight wind
Howling around the door
