Strong and almighty
I have heard the warning in my dreams
I've waited for the flash me stops the crash
Into the silence of my dirty cell
The loneliness kills me
The misgiving from a life after the jail
I have survived and sneer in your face
I have seen a dying friend
And every pain find to the end
And when I look into my eyes
I cry out in the mirror
No tears no tears no tears but more fears
I sell the visions out of my brain
I am benumb me
See through the milk glass the endless rain
Make of my bloody tears I feel the fear
Into the silence of this dirty room
The loneliness kills me
The reality of this life after the jail
I must survive and sneer in your face
Into the silence of this dirty room
The damned headache kills me
In sweet dreams arise a beauty in my head
But without a help I can never see the good timesYou might also like
