Black Sheep
Spell it to the letter, I'm not a forgetter
Some could tell my story, but who could tell it better
Nobody slimmer, thinkin' he's a winner
Pullin on a wool-er, finger on the trigger
Scramb-a-lin, ramb-a-lin, think cee-low ain't gamb-a-lin?
Ambul-ance, head crack!, cause he took a chance at
Getting with the one he didn't think'd flip
But if I'm takin' ya down, believe you're losing your grip
Money, I'm rollin', I'm folding, I'm folding again
Honeys I know, that wanna know me again
Let me tell a joke, cause I'm  funny again
Slept on a step, I'm gettin' money again
Yo, flim-to-the-flam to the D to the poise
Seperate the men from the boys, tools from the toys
Negroes'll front, that's if they got what you want
But, yo, they freeze on a stunt, I'm filling more than a blunt
Never was a gangster even at a street peak
But swingin' on a swinger, you'll be strollin with a leak
So get up easy cause it's simple as this
Give us a shot, how could you think that I miss
Yesterday's a memo, the demo sold a bundle
No, I'm not conceited though for you I won't be humble
Been around the block and it ain't my first day out
Crazy or dismayed and, yo, I throws a blow way out
Kids, we used to stay out till our moms needed to gray out
Hobbies we tackled with skelly and knock decay out
Papa sold the hurro, in every borough
Nobody could front, ya see my family's crazy thorough
Took one short and, yo, the others are done
No fables at the table
We'llerit the no that's in my blood
So I, stand tall and lay for the call to counter-react
Because we're real I tell ya who's got our back!

Takin' 'em all, can't stand the fall
Put my back on the wall
Takin' 'em all, can't stand the fall
Put my back on the wall, y'all

[Verse Two, Dres]:
Yo, it's not easy at the top which is why we play the back
Not to say that we don't strive, in fact, to be exact
It's a one-sided coin, gotta know how to flip
And I say "lucky in the fifth" if you ask me for a tip
Now we're back on, word to the light bill receipt
Methinks these things are broken links, how can we be complete
Heads always collidin', with the brain we could be glidin'
While we stab him in the back when I see his rod beside him
So long (Mr Lawnge: Huh?), we waited
So long (Mr Lawnge: What), we hated
Play it til this day it doesn't have to be debated
If I played it as an ego with a final line for group ins
So Lawnge:

[Mr Lawnge]
Never party poopin', scoopin'
While my loopin' and rhymin' are climbin'
Check it out, it's like this all the time
[Dres]
And I know

[Mr Lawnge]
And I know

[Dres]
And I know!

[Mr Lawnge]
And I know

[Dres]
Black Sheep freak sweet styles just like we're supposed ta
Cause Dres was pulling wool clothes before Black Sheep made a poster
Lawnge was liftin' skirts 'fore we ever made a t-shirt
And we've been leapin' obstacles before the game of Q*bert
Take this or that, both are phat, lookin' past the cat
That Sheep was playin' possum then they pull the rabbit from the hat!

Chorus (Dres):
Takin' 'em all, can't stand the fall
Put my back on the wall
Takin' 'em all, can't stand the fall
Put my back on the wall, y'all
Verse Three (Dres):
Now rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief
If I were an Indian, I wouldn't be the chief
You can play the chief but we be tippin' teepees
Cause money, he don't owe me, and honey, she don't see me
Chuckle at your belt buckle
Up tonight, I'm on the D-L expedition with permission
If the mission were impossible wouldn't be here, dear
Black Sheep droppin' song that last as long as Frigidaires
Call me Andres, Dres or Dre go, not to run it in the ground
I gave the recipe to Prego, out to sell it then in vials
Of ya-yo, from Play-Doh, parted, then we started
But it charted some, where over the rainbow
Guess I suffer from C-R-S cause I forgot 'em
Lyrics I got 'em, you need 'em, you need 'em, I got 'em
Can't stand the fall, the beef is out of reach
I mean the stakes are too high so I got to get each
And every single solitary legit digit on my ledger
Buggin' cause we did ya, keep coming, we dead ya
Clear in my eyes, me and a tear in a corner
Lay it on ya, I'm gonna, I'm gonna lay it on ya!

Chorus
