All the precious moments, cannot stay
It's not like wings have fallen, cannot stay
But still something's missing, cannot stay

Will I walk the long road? Cannot stay
There's no need to say goodbye

All the friends and family
All the memories going 'round, 'round, 'round, 'round
I have wished for so long
How I wish for you today

Will I walk the long road? Cannot stay
There's no need to say goodbye

All the friends and family
All the memories going 'round, 'round, 'round
I have wished for so long
How I wish for you today
How I've wished for so long
How I wish for you today

We all walk the long roadYou might also like
