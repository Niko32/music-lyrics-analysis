For the small months to return
In a while or pretty soon
Or pretty soon or in a while
Either way the time's delayed

Haven't seen them in a while
They went missing with the light
When the white oak has no answer
It turns its back on you
The maple calls you, shows you something new

No more chances
They won't fall for you
No more chances

Idle ski lifts have it right
Simple patience and resign
So it seems it's been a while
It's been a while or so it seems
Either way, the times between

The white oak can't stand you, love to leave you out
The maple shows you how it loves to get around

No more chances
It's all coming true
No more chances
They won't fall for you
No more chances
They won't fall for you
No more chancesYou might also like
