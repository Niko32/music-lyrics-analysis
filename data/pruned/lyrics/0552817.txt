I wonder who'll turn out the lights in your world tonight
Whose shoulder will your head be resting on
Will your hungry arms be reaching for someone you feel you need
Will that need still be there when he's gone
As I reach for the switch that turns out my lights
I wonder who'll turn out the lights in your world tonight
Has someone find a secret that I could never find
Is he touching that old switch that I've touched so many times
Is he turnin' on the woman I could never satisfy
I wonder who'll turn out the lights in your world tonight
Has someone find a secret...
