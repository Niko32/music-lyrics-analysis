It's Like this
Just a couple of boys
Chillin' out in the studio, making some noise
For all the snapbacking bitches and witches in stitches
Baby delicious, a rapper's delight, it's nutritious

Just H in the corner, caleb is smaller, j burke is taller
But it don't matter to me, cause i got self-esteem, floating out from my ears to my denim jeans

Which i coincidentally don't wear, reppin' the black pants, big jumpers, messy hair

Taking it steady with the girls in my life, two sisters one mother and my catey that's right

Yo it's passionate, just one of those great relationship, though i'm leaving for 2 weeks on a foreign trip, but that don't test me, our foundations are stronger than jessie

Verse 2 (I):

Here's the sitch. I was only a kid, rolling joints with j-burke in sheila's kip, nothing stronger than a friendship built on bong hits, shoutout to catey, i was swallowing it

If you know what I mean, it's obscene and that's true, she was handling balls like my boy babe ruth. if there's one thing stronger than the sex life, it's the relationship - she gonna be your wife

Away in france, learning linguistics, the positive response is an overwhelming statistic. It's ballistic, hits that girl like cricket. Buzz-easy (?) though, loving not dismissive

Relationship is great, she always misses him. start of something big like when jesus was christened. hair looks great with no effort put in, me hugo and HC agree that it's banging

Knees cracked open like cans of fishes. one young team with three big wishes;
1. to be a star
2. to go far
3. to find a girl to share his heart

Two months in advance, this young little boy is in a pretty girl's pants
He was head over heels and this young cool girl she was ankle over shoulders
His nuts were slapping against her like two large boulders

Boulders, yeah

I only kid, i'm just talking shit, honestly, this relationship is neat
