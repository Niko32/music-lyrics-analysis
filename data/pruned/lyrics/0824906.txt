Welcome to the circus
Leave your brain outside
Sit back, relax
As we feed you lies
Spoonfed stimulation
Glittering fashion fascination
You are lost in the game
Media corruption

[Pre-Chorus: Angela Gossow]
You'll be amused
By the things we do to you
But in the bitter end
The clown is you

[Chorus: Angela Gossow, Christopher Amott, Both]
End of the line
You sold your soul
For a better life
You are better off dead

[Verse 2: Angela Gossow]
You had one life
You had one shot
You blew it
And you knew it
The rot sets in
No self-control
At the end of the line
You play the fool
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Angela Gossow]
You'll be amused
By the things we do to you
But in the bitter end
The clown is you

[Chorus: Angela Gossow, Christopher Amott, Both]
End of the line
You sold your soul
For a better life
You are better off dead

[Post-Chorus: Angela Gossow, Christopher Amott, Both]
End of the line
You are better off dead (Dead, dead, dead)

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Angela Gossow]
End of the line
You sold your soul
For a better life
You are better off dead

[Post-Chorus: Angela Gossow, Christopher Amott, Both]
End of the line
You are better off dead
[Outro: Christopher Amott]
End of the line
