When everything goes wrong
And nothing seems to heal
All the wounds
That i made you feel
And everything so dark
No one can understand
All the mass emotions
Words unspoken
Everything's unsaid!

[Verse]
Bringing you down wasn't in the plan
But I guess this should happen
Our love was supposed to last
But now is a thing of the past
Counting the days until the end
Why does, this happen?
My whole life thrown to the ground
Now i have to get back!

[Chorus]

Counting the days until the end
Why does this happen?
My whole life thrown to the ground
Now i have to get back!
You might also like[Chorus]

[Outro]
When everything goes
Wrong...
And nothing seems to
Heal...
All the wounds, that i
Made you feel....
That i made you
Feel
