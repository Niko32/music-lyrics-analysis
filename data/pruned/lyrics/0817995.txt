You, me and the boys, barred from the shore

Fresh-faced imbeciles laughing at me
I've been laughing myself, is that so hard to see?
Do I have to spell each letter out, honestly?
If there's no room for laughter, there's no room for me
For me

Try looking at you rather than me
No truth is in here, it's all fantasy

Since the last time we met I've been through
About seven hundred changes and that's just a few
And the changes all tend to be something to do
But you've got to believe that they're all done for you
For you

Oh you'll think it's tragic when that moment first arrives
Oh but it's magic
It's the best years of our lives

Lost now for the words to tell you the truth
Please banter with me the banter of youth

If I knew how to say it, I would say it for you
If I knew how to whisper, I'd whisper for you
If I knew how to waltz, I'd get up and dance for you
If I thought I could run, I'd come running to you
To you
You might also likeI've discovered now how to be fair
This I could teach you if only I dare

The only conclusion that I've reached in my life
Is that if I should die, I should die by the knife
Since it's only a matter of courage, all right
Die a man or a martyr, the two would be nice
So nice

Oh you'll think it's tragic when that moment arrives
Oh, oh but it's magic
It's the best years of our lives

Oh you'll think it's tragic when that moment first arrives
Oh, oh but it's magic
It's the best years of our lives
