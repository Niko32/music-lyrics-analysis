I thought you were cool
I met you in a parking lot
One day after school
We didn't have no money
We didn't have no sense
You jumped in beside me
And then we jumped the fence

We had just enough gas to get to Memphis
Just the right song playing on the radio
Just enough highway to push the limit
We got tangled up with just enough rope

Oh, just enough rope
Barely hangin' on, barely in control
You and me baby and just enough rope

I was wild about you
You gave me your heart
We made a solemn promise
To never be apart
Days turned into months yeah
We were runnin' free
You and me together
And baby makes three
You might also likeWe had just enough pride
To think we'd make it
Just enough ride
To know the way to go
Just enough time
To find a preacher
We tied the knot
With just enough rope

Oh, just enough rope
Barely hangin' on, barely in control
You and me baby and just enough rope

We could have hung ourselves
Out to dry
But we wrapped it around
You and I
Then we pulled it tight
Here we stand
Ready to turn another page
Some things just get better with age
I've been lovin' you since
I can't remember when
I said it before
And I'll say it again
We got just enough fire
To keep it burning
Just enough dream
To never give up hope
Just enough love to last forever
We keep it tied together
With just enough rope
We keept it all together
With just enough rope

Oh, just enough rope
We're still hangin' on
We're still going strong
Just enough rope
Oh, just enough rope

'Round and around and around we go...
