[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Shawty, come here
I wanna grab your body, lay you on the sofa
And as I pull your hair
I'm gonna stroke your body, make you bend over for me
And you've been waitin' patiently for me to break you off
And, girl, your clothes still on, but I'ma rip 'em off
With my teeth, yeah, yeah, yeah
And, girl, I'ma whisper this into your ear
How deep do you want me to go?
Do you want me to speed it up, speed it up, or go slow?
Start from the bed, now we out here on the floor
Girl, you're really in for a treat now, but don't fall in love 'cause

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]
