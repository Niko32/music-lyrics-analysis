Baby, baby I can't let go, don't you know, girl, I love you so
I-I-I-I'll never break your heart, we will never part
And I can't, no I won't, let you go

Baby, I love you girl, I'm never gonna let you go
I'm never ever gonna hurt you so
When you are in my arms, you fill me up with
All of your charms, baby
You are the best thing that I have ever had
I'm never ever gonna treat you bad
I'm never ever gonna make you sad, girl
Step into my world, I'll do anything for you baby
Hold on, cause I want you to know

(Chorus)
Baby when you're not by my side
I miss you so much, I might cry

I'm a sensitive type of guy
Baby you're my desire, your love just takes me
Higher, higher, higher!
Anytime I see your face, you make me glad
I'm never ever gonna treat you bad
I'm never ever gonna make you sad, girl
Step into my life, girl you make everything alright
Hold on, cause I want you to know
You might also like(Chorus 2x)
I'm saving all my love for you
My love will be true, no other girl can compare to you
Now I am down on my knees, my love is aiming to please
Hold on, don't you ever go, cause I just want to let you know

(Chorus 2x)
