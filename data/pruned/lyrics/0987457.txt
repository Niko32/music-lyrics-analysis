I went into a home one day to see some friends of mine
Of all the books and magazines, not a Bible could I find
I asked them for the Bible, when they brought it, what a shame
For the dust was covered o'er it, not a fingerprint was plain

[Chorus]
Dust on the Bible, dust on the Holy Word
The words of all the prophets and the saints of the Lord
Of all the other books, you'll find there's none salvation holds
Get the dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul

[Verse 2]
You can read your magazines, read of love and tragic things
Not one word, a Bible verse, not a Scripture do you know
When it is the very truth and its contents good for you
But if dust is covered o'er it, it is sure to doom your soul

[Chorus]
Dust on the Bible, dust on the Holy Word
The words of all the prophets and the saints of the Lord
Of all the other books, you'll find there's none salvation holds
Get that dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul

[Verse 3]
Oh, you have a friend you'd like to help along the way
Just tell him that the Good Book shows a mortal how to pray
The best advice to give him that will make his burden light
Is to dust the family Bible, trade the wrong for the right
You might also like[Chorus]
Dust on the Bible, dust on the Holy Word
The words of all the prophets and the saints of the Lord
Of all the other books, you'll find there's none salvation holds
Get that dust off the Bible and redeem your poor soul
