Whoa-o-o-o-oa
It's Pressure

[Hook:]
Let me give you some love and affection
You got my attention
You need no correction
May Jah pour blessings in your direction
You've got my attention
What an impression

[Verse 1:]
So long I've been waiting
To be with you all alone
I've been anticipating
The first time we kissed was breathtaking
And girl, we got a bright future in the making
When we are together
My heart feels so much better
Girl, I need you and that's no lie
Whenever that we make love
I breath Jah-Jah take cause
And I'm so glad that I made you mine
Keep that precious smile on your face
Jah will keep you warm and safe
Make it worthwhile
Just you and I
With love the Most High creates
Let's start a family and make things great
Cause when and how we met Girl
It's not a mistake

[Verse 2:]
There's something about her
I just can't be without her
(Never had a woman like you)
Never had a woman of such virtue
Oh-I'll give you my love
Girl, I got no intentions to hurt you, hurt you

Stay close to me
Don't slip away
With the romance we made
Wherever I go you will follow
I'll keep you warm and safe
Make sure the children have health and strength
Cause when I say " I love you"
That's what I meant

[Hook]

[Verse 3:]
People say things
And that no break you
Girlfriend I truly appreciate you
Touch the street
Everything man a rate you
I bring you inna me room and-
Good loving await you
From the darkness the Rastaman awake you
With corruption them can't mistake you
Only Pressure Buss Pipe can mate you. (woo, woo-oo-oo)
