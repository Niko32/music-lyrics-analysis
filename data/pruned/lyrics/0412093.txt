Got my mind in the palm of my hand
Don't want to lose it
Fingertips covered in oil, oil
From the blood of tears that I spilled, on the white carpet
Certainly almost called then I said

[Hook]
Fuck it all
Fuck it all
Fuck it all
Fuck it all
Fuck it all
Fuck it all
Fuck it all
Fuck it all
Fuck it all
Fuck it all
Fuck it all
I said fuck it all

[Verse 2]
Cause I could be whole lot of things
Go on and clip my wings
Could be a piss drunk bitch of a whore
Running round hoping maybe you would save me
Throw you a few curve balls
Act like a broken doll
Just say fuck it all
You might also like[Hook]

[Breakdown]
Got my heart on the edge of my seat
Donâ€™t wanna break it
Any more than it already is
Pieces of me on the floor
But I got them all
I won't let this rob me of my joy
I gotta reinstall
So I said

[Hook]
