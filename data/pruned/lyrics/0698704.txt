When I was young, younger than now, I went to school like always
We took our bags, we took a trip to Freddy's Pizzeria
There was a sign, no frowns allowed. We passed through the glowing hallways
The air was filled with not a care in our world, then I saw ya
The janitor said come with me, got something cool to show ya
I followed him into the back, where costumes lined the walls

[Pre-Chorus 1]
There were three others there, and we sat there and stared
The janitor took away our contented looks
He stuffed and he pushed us into wire-framed suits
He ran from the lot while he left us to rot

[Chorus 1]
Camera 1 and 2 and 3, I swear to God, they're after me
I see their faces on the screen, but nowhere they are to be seen
Lock the door and keep it shut, don't let them in no matter what
No power left, an empty cup. Don't let those doors open up!

[Verse 2]
For years, we rotted in these shells, our souls never ascending
Our fragile bones has fused with steel and wires, never ending
The others have long since forgot their roots in mortality
I still hold tight what's left of what once was my reality
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
I sit and I wait, for a change of my fate
But the longer we fray, brings longer dismay
And now we are here, after 30 odd years
We cry underneath rows of plaster framed teeth

[Chorus 1]
Camera 1 and 2 and 3, I swear to God, they're after me
I see their faces on the screen, but nowhere they are to be seen
Lock the door and keep it shut, don't let them in no matter what
No power left, an empty cup. Don't let those doors open up!

[Pre-Chorus 3]
But I must admit, that it is you Mr. Schmidt
That brings back the pain that has kept us detained
I think of that day, where my life was stripped away
The janitor, he looks like you to me

[Chorus 2]
Camera 1 and 2 and 3. I swear to God, they're after me!
I see their faces on the screen, but nowhere they are to be seen
I'm the one that took your lives, but it seems that you never died
I took this job to pay the bills, but this job might just get me killed!
