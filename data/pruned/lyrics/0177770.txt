Honestly, I just wanna go down
Try to pretend there's nothing wild
Why do you treat yourself so bad

[Chorus 1]
City's full of
City's full of
City's full of
Sissy pretty love yeah

Your serious eyes dehumanize
What you wanted, what you wanted was never sad
Who blew the flames out of your eyes?
Why do you treat yourself so bad?

[Chorus 1]
City's full of
City's full of
City's full of
Sissy pretty love yeah

[Chorus 2]
City's full of
Sissy pretty love yeah
City's full of sissy pretty love
Sissy pretty love
Sissy pretty love yeah

On your thighs
I love the wrinkles
Around your eyes
I take you out darling
We dance all night
But when comes sunlight
You say
I'm going back home

[Chorus 2]
City's full of
Sissy pretty love yeah
City's full of sissy pretty love
Sissy pretty love
Sissy pretty love yeah
