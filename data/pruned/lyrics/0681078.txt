I wished I was in Austin in the Chili Parlor Bar
Drinking Mad Dog Margaritas and not caring where you are
But here I sit in Dublin just rolling cigarettes
Holding back and choking back the shakes with every breath

[Chorus]
So forgive me all my anger, forgive me all my faults
There's no need to forgive me for thinking what I thought
I loved you from the get go and I'll love you till I die
I loved you on the Spanish Steps the day you said goodbye

[Verse 2]
Now I am just a poor boy, work's my middle name
If money was a reason, well, I would not be the same
I'll stand up and be counted, I'll face up to the truth
I'll walk away from trouble, but I can't walk away from you

[Chorus]
Forgive me all my anger, forgive me all my faults
There's no need to forgive me for thinking what I thought
I loved you from the get go and I'll love you till I die
I loved you on the Spanish Steps the day you said goodbye

[Verse 3]
I have been to Fort Worth and I have been to Spain
I have been too proud to come in out of the rain
I have seen the David, I've seen the Mona Lisa too
I have heard Doc Watson play "Columbus Stockade Blues"
You might also like[Chorus]
Forgive me all my anger, forgive me all my faults
There's no need to forgive me for thinking what I thought
I loved you from the get go and I'll love you till I die
I loved you on the Spanish Steps the day you said goodbye

[Outro]
Well I wished I was in Austin, hmm, in the Chili Parlor Bar
Drinking Mad Dog Margaritas and not caring where you are
