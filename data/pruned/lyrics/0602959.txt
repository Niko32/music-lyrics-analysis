I know my way around an engine
But you won't see me riding in a NASCAR race
Rolling up on #88
I wasn't bad in the pads in high school
But you won't see me getting any prime time play
On a Monday night football game
But you say I'm good enough for you baby

[Chorus]
I guess it's true some fools get lucky
When I'm next to you I'm right on the money
I look in your eyes and my only question
Is how did a 7 wind up with an 11?
I don't deserve ya, baby
I don't deserve ya, baby

[Verse 2]
I know there's things that you need to hear
And sometimes the right words won't come
I'm no Shakespeare or Kristofferson
When you shine like a diamond
On the dance floor as the music plays
I'm the only thing in your way
But you still let me lead ya darling
You might also like[Chorus]

[Bridge]
When I think of everybody living under the sun
I wonder how I ever got to be your only one
When I am a 7 at best

[Bridge]
Well I guess it's true some fools get lucky
When I'm next to you I'm right on the money
I look in your eyes and my only question
Is how did a 7 wind up with an 11?
I don't deserve ya, baby
I don't deserve ya, baby

[Outro]
I don't deserve ya, baby
I don't deserve ya, baby
