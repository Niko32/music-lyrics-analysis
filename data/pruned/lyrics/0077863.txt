Song about the milk duds and the ass cheeks
Pass the beat when im feelin too nasty
Crafty niggas gonna have to move past me
Haul ass pass first class im too classy

[Verse 1: Mike Fate]
My words hit hard as a diamond
Bitches listen to what im sayin like im Simon
Im climbin, up the entire rap ladder
And these niggas can't hold me like a ripped bladder
My flow's so great that its ironic
Cause they thought i'd be bad but now I am iconic
And sonic ain't faster than my speed of thought
Surprise at the experience that I brought
See I'm the shit like straight out the ass
Bout be gettin more green than grass
Fought off death and now im full of life
And on the tip of my dick is yo new wife

[Hook]
Song about the milk duds and the ass cheeks
Pass the beat when im feelin too nasty
Crafty niggas gonna have to move past me
Haul ass pass first class im too classy

Mechanical flow
Got the X's and O's
Fuck a Tic Tac Toe
You're saying I'm underground
Then I'm stubbing your toe
Ice cold snow
As cold as the cold wind blows
Numbing your nose

Raping this beat is a must be
Might bust a Sandusky
Lyrics got many arms
So some must be musty

Masticate the bait
I'm the star of Dave
In your case
It's not brave
To surround me with a rave
Thinking ya can blaze

I go ape mess
When I'm on my apex
It's a rape fest
With no latex
Lines flex like eight eight-packs
Succumb to the bomb
Leave you breathless like a tied lunge
Quick witted, never had a tied tongue
So until the time comes

There ain't no discussion
I'm causing concussions
And bust out combustions
With no interruption

It's CRITTical
With my pen I'm pinning down your pinnacle

[Verse 3: Mike Fate]
I'mma dick like in front of the asshole
Pass those bitches when they gettin to bashful
Smash hoes havin more kids than castro
Then I coast from coast to coast like fiasco (kick push)
With a cold case of ugly ass nigga look
Gotta go back cause I think I just missed the hook (you didn't)
I spit nasty shit, notepad is a spit cup
I Tell em niggas lift they head like a sit up
Workin hard to change my reality
Now these niggas feel my weight like gravity
My raps so sweet leave you stuck with a cavity
Leave niggas dead like fuck a calamity
I ain't got patience and fuck a virtue
Knock a nigga out like I put him on a curfew
Now my words hit deep like Gospel
Harder than crack rocks straight up your nostril
[Hook]
Song about the milk duds and the ass cheeks
Pass the beat when im feelin too nasty
Crafty niggas gonna have to move past me
Haul ass pass first class im too classy
