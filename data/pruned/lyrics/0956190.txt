You dragged it around and you broke it in two
You don't get no more, you don't get no more
When you use up my heart, you don't get no more, no more

Well, it's honey but this, honey but that
When you run out of buts that's the end of that
You don't get no more, you don't get no more
When you run out of buts, you don't get no more, no more

You only get one soul and that's a fact
You sell it to the devil and you don't get it back
You don't get no more, you don't get no more
When you sell your soul, you don't get no more, no more

Either get off or get on down the line
Your calling card is running out of time

Well, when your friends are all gone and the moeny runs low
And your only true love is a high dollar hope
You don't get no more, you don't get no more
When your gold is gone, you don't get no more, no more, no more

When I stop singin' it's the end of the song
When you stop listening it's time to move on
You don't get no more, you don't get no more
When you've lost your friends and you run out of rope
When you've sold your soul and you're all out of hope
When you break the only heart that I've got
You don't get no more, no moreYou might also like
