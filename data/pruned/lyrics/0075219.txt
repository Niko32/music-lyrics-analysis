The Porsche porcelain, the rims are gorgeous
The earth went skrrrt, it got so many horses
An all white chain same color your forces
An ounce of what I smoke cost double your mortgage
So Icy Entertainment I'mma esplain it
Cause when we come in niggas takin' they chain in
I lost my train of thought bitches calling me brainless
I can't buy a burger cause I'm too fucking famous
Put the whip on a donk, give my Chevy a facelift
My 28" Ashantis make it look like a spaceship
The rims look big like the lips of Fantasia
My paint drips wet like activator
You playing with yourself, you a masturbator
You play with So Icy, I have to spray ya
Don't waste all your life being a couch potato
After a while crocodile, see ya later hater
It's Gucci

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
150 Ps got it smelling like weed
In the trap bustin bales down it's time to eat
21 a key, 10 five a half a key, 55 a quarter key nigga come and see a G
Standing on the stove hard, working with them boulders
All these extra grams oughta bring me mo' cheese
Time to count that money man, man I need another hand
Bands after band, tell the fam it's time to eat

There's money to be gotten, the crack is running low
I ain't got no purple plug, regular weed moving slow
Hidey Ho, like Robin Hood, robbin in another hood
I chop a barrel, shove it down ya throat and make it understood
Got 'em for a half a brick, eight pounds of purple
80 for the 7 grams, smokin on good purple
Jack fools, make ya strip down to ya butthole
Used to go to school with the foo, but I'm cuckold
Get it how I'm livin, by the gun bullets spittle
AK 40 pumpin bullets like a sickle
I'm just a head crown, hold da jeans all white kicks
Watch 30 grand, like I slang all white bricks
North Memphis niggas when it's good we do bad deals
Hittin forty block, all wop, that's how crack kills
Stacks will rise or somebody gonna pay the piper
I just want the stash don't you make me put you in a diaper (One of them Pampers nigga)

[Chorus: Gucci Mane]
150 Ps got it smelling like weed

21 a key, 10 five a half a key, 55 a quarter key nigga come and see a G
Standing on the stove hard, working with them boulders
All these extra grams oughta bring me mo' cheese
Time to count that money man, man I need another hand
