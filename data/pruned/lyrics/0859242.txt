Wo-ho-ho, wo-ho-ho (Yeah, yeah)
Wo-ho, now now (Uh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
How could I leave?
How could I possibly go on?
If you should say goodbye
Just like a rose
If you don't water it every morn'
It withers and it dies

[Chorus]
Promise you won't leave me
Promise you won't hurt me
Promise you won't ever make me blue
If you ever leave me, If you should desert me
Baby, I don't know just what I'd do
I don't know just what I'd do
I really don't know just what I'd do (Woah!)

[Verse 2]
It was ordained that man should leave his mother and cling
To the woman that he loves (Uh, yeah)
I'm very sure
That I could never love anyone
The way I love you now (Oh-oh yeah)

Promise you won't leave me
Promise you won't hurt me
Promise you won't ever make me blue
If you ever leave me, If you should desert me
Baby, I don't know just what I'd do
I don't know just what I'd do
I really don't know just what I'd do (Woah!)

[Bridge]
How could I, how could I, baby
Woah, yeah-yeah
Woah, now-now (Uh, yeah)

[Verse 3]
It was ordained that man should leave his mother and cling
To the woman that he loves (Uh, yeah)
I'm very sure (Yeah)
That I could never love anyone
The way I love you now (Oh-oh yeah)

[Outro]
Promise you won't leave me
Promise you won't hurt me
Promise you won't ever make me blue
