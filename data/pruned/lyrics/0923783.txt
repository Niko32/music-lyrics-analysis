There's no way out
Viscera are all flying at you, gleaming
You've got a hole in your trouser leg
Oh, you're going down
All staring to see how it'll play out

Oh, see what you've done here
You twisted my arm, oh
I can see what's going on here
You've done me no harm
But everything's changed
Things have gone strange
And they'll never, never be the same again
Never, never be the same again, oh

I said "Tell them a story
As quick as you can"
But you chose unwisely
You should've gone for the one
About the Japanese cat
Now they just think you're crazy

Oh, you sing along
As if somehow you've already heard
Something mean
I'm right behind
Fighting my way in space time
Space and time
And what will become of the wonder
The what, if, and why?
They render me devout, that trinity
Will all of my hope be the moor for a new citadel?
We'll fill all those streets with mischief and revelry
You might also likeOh, see what you've done here
You twisted my arm, oh
I can see what's going on here
You've done me no harm
Everything's changed
Things have got strange
And they'll never, never be the same again
No, no, no, no
Never be the same again, oh
