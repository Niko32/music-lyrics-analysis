If I'd only been straight with you
Cuz I know I tried to tell you every day
I guess there's nothin left that I can do
Are you afraid of what's been goin on
Could it be that I've been gone so long
Is there something that you want to see
Tell me baby, could it ever be?
Cuz if you're holding on, I'm holding on to you
Cuz you're the only one
I sit around in the van when no ones lookin
Tryin to figure out what to do
I'm feeling bad cuz I know I shouldve told ya
I was hoping you already knew
That you're afraid of what's been goin on
Could it be that I've been gone so long
Is there something that ya wanna see
Tell me baby could it ever be
Cuz if you're holding on, I'm holding on to you
Cuz you're the only oneonly one
Can't ya see it's all for you
I hipe you're waitingk, cuz I've veen telling everybody
I've been waiting for the day
Cuz when it's over, ya know that I'll come runnin back
To you
I'm waiting for the dayit won't be long
I hope ya ain't found anybody
Can't ya see it's all for you
Cuz when it's over, ya knopw that I'll come runnin
Back to you
Keep holdin on, keep holdin onYou might also like
