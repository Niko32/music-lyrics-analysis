Have you ever wondered why you're here?
Why we're here?
If life has a point beyond the nine-to-five and an ice cold beer?
I don't know, I don't know, maybe I'm thinking too much
But I know, I know, that my soul is out of touch
Is this just survival, making it day to day
Or is today just another way of saying yesterday tomorrow?
Is there something beyond this sorrow?
Something on the other side?
Is there another side?
I feel like I've been lied to
But maybe I'm the one telling the lies
Try, try, sigh, sigh, cry, cry, die, die
Is that the pattern of life's lines?
No lifeline that makes this life shine?
I shy from that picture of a lifetime
Cause my life's mine
"Myself!" it cries
"Myself" it tries
I'm selfish, I know
But I tried;
At least I tried
And maybe that's all that needs to be done before I die

[Chorus]
Save me! Not because I'm dying, because I don't know how to live!
Save me! Not because I'm running, but because I'm standing still!
Save me! Not because I'm failing, but because I can't even start!
Save me! Save me! Save me! I don't know where to go!

Everyday I do the same thing:
Open my eyes and shower
Go to work and watch the hours tick by
Just to get by
And this is my life!
With no end in sight
I’d wave the white flag
But there’s no one to fight!
I envy the man that knows he would lay down his life;
I wish I had that kind of conviction and might
But when I lay down at night
Turn out the light
I find my soul contrite
For sins unknown, and bound by shackles tight
And dreams bring no reprieve
Night terrors offer no relief
I wish you knew what I was goin’ through
I wish I could let you see
See me seized by this deceit
When I believe
That life’s as pointless as it seems
As pointless as these dreams
I wish you could hear me scream
Even when I seem fine
I wish you could see me weep
Right before I drift to sleep
Everyday I do the same thing:
Open my eyes and shower
Go to work  and watch the hours tick by
Just to get by
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Because I’m all on my own
And I just wanna go home
But I don’t know where to go!
Save me, save me, save me
Save me, save me, save me, I don’t know where to go!
