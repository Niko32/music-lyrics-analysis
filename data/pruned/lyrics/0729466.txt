It’s now second nature
To wreck the competition
During a mission
Burning bridges
That once let in the kids that gave me emotional stitches
In my composition
I wrote hooks and swings
Seem more real then what literature can sting
I wasn’t picked on a lot
Cause of my buff nerd status
Put me on the list in don’t f with bracket
I used to imagine
That I could do the impossible
They called it impossible so I wanted to go
Do as many things as possible
For me that is…
A workaholic that’s a compliment
For me that is…
My nappy hair caressed by white girls
Yes this kid…
I heard go figure a lot
So in my figment-tation
My thoughts were the keystone
That hold the doorway open
I walked in
Still don’t understand yet what I created
Sooner or later
Friends might pick up on my newfound behavior
I used to be candy snatchin’
In my young dreams Vince Lombardi trophy patchin’
Figuring these magazines ensured these fantasies
Too good to be true
That’s what it seems
But still these instructors in different categories
Be telling me the same story
That I withhold so much potential
Coming to a new threshold
You might also like[Chorus: Trey]
Round and round let go, change up the same ol' thing
With these memories and moments that all these people bring
So let's sing with the birds and get lost in thought
‘Cause we all get that feeling when we paid the wrong cost
Yeah, let’s set it off that standards are skewed
And we are just a few dudes who went past curfew
Who knew, that we could move like m from mc
That crowd, I wanna forget ‘em and just do me

[Verse 2: Definition]
Now I ain’t the optimistic type
Glass half empty
Mind fucked up so I dare ya try and tempt me
Only sixteen but I feel like I am forty-six
Already suffered my whole life
I feel like this is fuckin’ it
Amazing things could happen
But I could really give a shit
Bitches lined up out the door tryin’ hop on Deffie’s Dick
And I could care less
These bitches only hoes
I already hit my prime when I was 14 old
And ever since then life seems so dull
Popped everything fuckin’ Molly ‘till I roll
But that’s no longer my life
Been sober 60 days
Getting oxycontin out my system never felt so strange
And I thought I lost my motivation
Beard growing to the floor
Crazy shit I’m contemplating
I don’t speak of anymore
But I’mma come back like I gotta fighting chance
Break yo fuckin’ head, neck, and nose
Put you in a trance
Have you rushed away, ambulance to the doctor
And I mean it when I say bet ‘cha wish I shot ya
Fuckin’ with these cannons
A mistake that’ll end yo’ life
Me and my boy Trey, crazier then Wesley Snipes
Chop you up, butcher’s knife
Dismember your whole body
Wrap you in a garbage bag
Send you to yo’ mommy
‘Cause I’m crazier then shit
And I don’t give a fuck
And if you don’t like the way I rhyme then you could get fucked
[Chorus: Trey]
That crowd, I wanna forget ‘em and just do me
Who knew, that we could move like m from mc
And we are just a few dudes who went past curfew
Yeah, let’s set it off that standards are skewed
‘Cause we all get that feeling when we paid the wrong cost
So let's sing with the birds and get lost in thought
With these memories and moments that all these people bring
Round and round let go, change up the same ol' thing

[Outro: Trey]
Same ol’ thing
Ol’ thing
Thing
