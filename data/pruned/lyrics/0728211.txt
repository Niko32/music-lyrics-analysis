I'd rather die young than grow old without you
So don't ever leave me whatever you do
Though others may tempt you and tell you they care
You'll find only sorrow in a secret affair

[Chorus:][x2]
I'd rather die young than grow old all alone
Please tell me you love me let me, call you my own
To see someone's picture where my picture hung
Believe me my darling I'd rather die youngYou might also like
