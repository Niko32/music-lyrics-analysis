From the days that rescued me
Things aren't what
They used to be
But I'm stayin' care free

I've said these words a thousand times
Different phrasing and different rhymes
But its on the same two lines
'cause I found your note
Said "I'm leaving this town and I won't be back for you"
I got your note
And it feels good to be free

So don't say that I'm being cold
I'm not I'm just feeling bored
With the same old, same old me
And everything is just dollars and cents
And everyone is making plans
For the vacation that you can't afford
You're gone

'cause I found your note
Said "I'm leaving this town and I won't be back for you"
I got your note
And it feels good to be free
You might also likeIt feels good to be free

'cause I found your note
Said "I'm leaving this town and I won't be back for you"
I got your note
And it feels good to be free
