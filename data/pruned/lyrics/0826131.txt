Sleep
Just a reason to
Escape
All the dog wars
Track
Every move they ever
Make
And I'm religious one time
Blow apart understanding
Will it ever change?
Don't believe what you're thinking
Draw the line in your own way
Sun
Crashing down around my
Bed
Like dirty murder
Me
With a glass of broken
Pride
Can I get a witness today?
Say what you wanna
And release it all
Take a walk till I'm dizzy
The crow flies in me
A soul you can't see
The crow flies in me
The crow flies...You might also like
