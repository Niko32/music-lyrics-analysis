I'm exhausted, they tell me to follow the rules
But I'm often crossing my morals against the system
That I'm lost in not walking, not going no where fuck them
They don't even care kept us living unfair punk ya, twist in the air
I'm telling god to wake up, this city so  [?]
I'm ripping the stem off up of your back cause it rapes us
And I'm not talking about these rappers throwing up pyramids
It's ways deeper than what they say and their appearances
So all these conspiracies need to slow their roll
Wanna hate somebody hate the damn lies you've been told
On folds they roll they cold [?]
But oppose with moles who hold the roll till dead arose
So think of the fraction they using our asses like plastic
Think about that shit are national banks paying taxes
Making the money off the people just ain't alright
They keep us stupid and blind so they control our life
Yeah, so they control our life
They control our lives
Yeah so they control our lives
Wassssup
Awaken your minds
Let it rewind yo yo

[verse 2: self provoked]
You might also likeDo you of believe in death, do you believe in god?
Do you believe in miracles and beating our bad odds
Heaven or hell only time can tell
Saying farewell our souls will say peace
Our body deceased our image is pale
6 feet deep I bet we see no tunnel
Lived your whole life dedicated to a book of struggles
Without faith you crumble mentality weak
Like infants my existence will for sure leave foot prints like pilgrims
So listen, listen
So listen, listen

[Chorus]

Open up your ears open up your minds
Question authority we wasting our time
Follow him and follow that yo
They tell  me to follow him and follow that
Yeah
Open up your ears open up your minds
Question authority we wasting our time follow him
And follow that yo
They tell me to follow him and follow that
But I say nah
But I say nah..
