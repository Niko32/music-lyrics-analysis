No need to give a bunch of lame half-assed excuses
Why this ain’t love, I’m blonde but I ain’t stupid
I wasn’t looking for a ring it doesn’t mean it doesn’t sting
When you cut and run so soon
Good luck, so long
I guess I better get to leavin' too

[Chorus]
A half truth’s still a lie
I need my space is still goodbye
A wrong size shoe could look good on you
But you’ll be cussin' your feet at midnight
A half cold beer ain’t cold
I’ll be back soon is still gone
A half-smoked cigarette’s still smoked
And a half broke heart’s still broke
Na, Na, Na, Na
A half broke heart is still broke

[Verse 2]
Upfront no strings
Sure fun till it unravels
Won't see me cry
But I might kind of want to call you tonight
Pour me a drink but don't make it too strong
Cause I need a little kicker to help me move on
I could say I don't care
But just okay ain't all the way there
You might also like[Chorus]
A half truth’s still a lie
I need my space is still goodbye
A wrong size shoe could look good on you
But you’ll be cussin' your feet at midnight
A half cold beer ain’t cold
I’ll be back soon is still gone
A half-smoked cigarette’s still smoked
And a half broke heart’s still broke
Na, Na, Na, Na
A half broke heart is still broke

[Bridge]
Just because you don't call it love don't mean it don't mean a thing
I saw it coming and no hard feelings but it's hard feeling this way

[Chorus 2]
A half truth’s still a lie
I need my space is still goodbye
A wrong sized shoe could look good on you
But you’ll be cussin your feet at midnight
A half-cold beer ain’t cold
I’ll be back soon is still gone
A half smoked cigarette is still smoked
And a half broke heart is still broke
Na, Na, Na, Na
A half broke heart is still broke
Na, Na, Na, Na
A half broke heart is still broke
Na, Na, Na, Na
A half broke heart is still broke
