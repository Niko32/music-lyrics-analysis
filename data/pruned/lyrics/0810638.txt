You're the only one who knows what I'm going through and
Like the hickory wind, he's gone again
Sweet Emmylou

Sweet Emmylou, as the needle runs through you
The way the pain shines through, well I know you've been there too
Those Sad Melodies, Oh how they comfort me
Sweet Emmylou

Well I hate to bother you again, last time you helped my poor heart mend
Then he came along
So I put your records all away, thought happy songs was all I'd play
But I was wrong... oh I was wrong

Sweet Emmylou, what are we gonna do
It's only been a week or two, and he's found someone new
Looks like it's gonna be, another night of you and me
Sweet Emmylou

Well I hate to bother you again, last time you helped my poor heart mend
Then he came along So I put your records all away, thought happy songs was all I'd play
But I was wrong...OH, I was wrong...

Sweet Emmylou
