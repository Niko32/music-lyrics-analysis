The sun won't be up for another hour or so
So many ways to leave before the dawn
It only takes one if you feel you can't go on

If there's a story that goes
With every name
I wish that sometimes they were all just the same
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
If a sign of hesitation gives you away you may as well hang it up today

Telephone's ringing
27 minutes past ten
Distant relatives bothering you again
Hold away the phone saying
Please, please, please
Hang up your phone with your head between your knees

If there's a story that goes
With every name
I wish that sometimes they were all just the same
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
If a sign of hesitation gives you away you may as well shut it down today

It was in a car
Was in an ashtray at the other side of the bar
I was thinking 'bout nothing when the phone began to ring
I was thinking 'bout leaving
'cause I didn't wanna hear a thing

If there's a story that goes
With every name
Now I wish that sometimes they were all just the same
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
If a sign of hesitation gives you away you may as well turn it off today
Oh yeah, Oh yeah
If a sign of hesitation gives you away you may as well blow it all away
Oh yeah, Oh yeah..
