Put my fist through the wall
Burn every letter
Just make ashes of it all
Man I could learn to settle
For less than what we had
Give someone else my body
But youve got all the love I had
And I cant take it back
And I cant let it go
Its more than words and cold hard facts
Its a fire you left in my soul
I can say I dont want you
Convince my head its true
But I know in my heart
Theres no unloving you
If Id only known
Thered every come this day
Id never had said hello
Id have just turned and walked away
And I wouldnt be here
Begging for another chance
Id never know what love was
And how it feels when it slips through your hands
Cause I cant take it back
And I cant let it go
Its more than words and cold hard facts
Its a fire you left in my soul
I can say I dont want you
Convince my head its true
But I know in my heart
Theres no unloving you
Oh I cant take it back
And I cant let it go
Its more than words and cold hard facts
Its a fire you left in my soul
I can say I dont want you
Convince my head its true
But I know in my heart
Theres no unloving you
Yeah I know in my heart
Theres no unloving youYou might also like
