And I guess the least I could have done was call
I hear you say who is it then you open up your door
And you see this fool here standin' in the hall

It's that time of night when a man needs some lovin'
And my wanting grows stronger for you
It's that time of night when a man needs his woman
And only your lovin' will do

Your bedside light is shining on the teardrops in your eyes
And I hold you just the way I always do
Your trembling body tells me so much more than any words
That you need me just as much as I need you

It's that time of night when a man needs some lovin'
And my wanting grows stronger for you
It's that time of night when a man needs his woman
And only your lovin' will do

It's that time of night when a man needs some lovin'
And my wanting grows stronger for you
It's that time of night when a man needs his woman
And only your lovin' will do...You might also like
