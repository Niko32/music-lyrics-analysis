Baby
You don't wanna make me cry
Or I will fill you
With the emptiness inside
Okay, alright!
Baby
You don't wanna say goodbye
Or I will soak you
In this rich formaldehyde

[Chorus]
Cause you're beautiful tonight
And the stars are burning bright
And I give this curse to you
Like there is nothing else to do
So let the purple sky explode
Let it shower us with toads
Let the scarlet river flood
So it can drown us all in blood
I just hope you don't, hope you don't

[Verse 2]
It's funny
How crazy that you make me feel sometimes
I'm so broken
I can barely even rhyme
Okay, alright!
Honey
It's crazy that you take up all my time
Got me sipping
At a gross amount of wine
You might also like[Chorus]
But you're beautiful tonight
And the stars are burning bright
And I give this curse to you
Like there's nothing else to do
So let the purple sky explode
Let it shower us with toads
Let the scarlet river flood
Let it drown us all in blood

[Bridge]
Tonight, I guess
I'm human, so thank you
For fighting and having
Sex with me
Tonight, I guess
I'm human, so thank you
For fighting and having
Sex with me
Oh!
