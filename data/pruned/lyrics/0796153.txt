Timing is everything
You know it's beautiful
Look at you
You know you're beautiful
Needs some attention
They made me a prince
Said I'm important
They raised me upon stilts
No one can touch me
Gowns and panties
Fashion magazines
Stained with grape juice
And torn at the seam
I just want to hold you in my arms
And sleep in your bed
A quiver of arrows
Was left in your stead
The gorgeous lies that I want to believe
Each one a promise of everything I need

You know it's beautiful
It's your own invention
You know it's beautiful
It's your own invention
You know it's beautiful
It's your own invention
You know you're beautiful
I know you're beautiful
