Everybody's far in this room
I'm alone
I'm freezed in this world with my bonds
Everybody's near in this room
I'm constrained

How many days have I spent
In recalling the ghost of who I was
Deeply ashamed for this damnation
Pleased with these blunt thorns
In my heart

How many lights have I turned
At the seas in search of a course

Keeping myself in disarray
Leaving that voice crying
Out for my crimes

How many nights have I spent
Trying to keep my soul in control

How many times have I said
I will do, I will change, I will go
Shaken by the strength of those lies
Blinded by the fear of those dreams
Crushed by the weight of my sins
You might also likeHow many doors have I closed
Trying to keep the countless
Shadows out of here

But in the end I kept staying
In this lighthouse
