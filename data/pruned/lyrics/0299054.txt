Mom, I know I let you down
And though you say the days are happy
Why is the power off, and I'm fucked up?
And, Mom, I know he's not around
But don't you place the blame on me
As you pour yourself another drink, yeah

[Hook: Nate Ruess]
I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on
Maybe we took this too far

[Verse 2:EGW]
Dear Mom
I know we've had our fair shair of fights
But I don't go to sleep without thinkin of you atleast once a night
Because of all the things we used to do together
And all the homes we had to lose together
The way you were treated, it ain't an excuse
I didn't grow up like others, But you'll have to excuse
My poor behavior I'm lost
I didn't think there would be a cost
Or a toll, and the fact you couldn't control
The outcome of your relationships
All those men, they were fuckin shits
Pretty smelly, if you ask me
They didn't deserve you, they were unworthy
I see you got a man who will treat you right
Thats good, but he fucks up and he'll meet my right
Cause you're beautiful, and deserve someone who will treat you like a queen
The way I've been acting, I know I've been obscene
Thats why i had to go, this direction is where the wind blowed
And I know, That you were dying inside while you signed those papers
And the expression when i said "Bye Ma, See you later"
That said it all, But I still love you
And It hurts when i don't hear a I love you too
But, I know you're in pain
Because your son mentally insane
But forgive me ma this once
Because this silence is too fuckin much

[Verse 2: EGW]
But it'll never change the fact
That if you died I'd have a heart attack
Cause your my # 1 and I was yours too
Even though i acted wrong, just give me a clue
As too how long ago I was just like you
Doing stupid things cause it was cool
And you werent tryin to impress as many people as i was
But you still did it, regardless
Just take a look inside and realize
That underneath these blue eyes
Is a boy that can't find
A place to stay,too many homes
I traveled worldwide, next day we're gone
I don't blame you, I blame me
I could never get along with your hubby
And if life is a timebomb
I still question why mine hasn't gone off
But i'm out
Dont think i dont care
Cause that just ain't fair

I guess we are who we are
Headlights shining in the dark night I drive on

[Verse 3: Nate Ruess]
I want a new life (start over)
One without a cause (clean slate)
So I'm coming home tonight (yeah)
Well, no matter what the cost
And if the plane goes down
Or if the crew can't wake me up
Well, just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Oh, even if there's songs to sing
Well, my children will carry me
Just know that I'm alright
I was not afraid to die
Because I put my faith in my little girl
So I never say, "Goodbye, cruel world."
Just know that I'm alright
I am not afraid to die
