Which came back every time
That I called to mind
My past
Crept into my head
Like a black wave
Or deafening noise

But now
I'm ready to begin again
Cause i learned to recognize the chance
And change this evil frame of mind
Into something like a sweet romance
I deleted every qualm of conscience
And so i began to forgive myself

No matter if i killed or
If i kept in a trap
'cause somebody told me that
If i regret
My soul will be safeYou might also like
