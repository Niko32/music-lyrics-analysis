To the world to chase a dream
A simple twist of fate turned a twisted path
Of alcohol and methamphetamines
Its the same old story Ive heard a thousand times
Of lost souls and wicked deeds of men
But on moonlit night down on bended knee
I swore id never go that path again
I spent a life time in that world
Ive seen some men go down real hard
Ive heard them knockin on my door
I just cant go down that road no more
I just cant go down that road no more
I did the best I could to try to hide my shame
The light of day it rarely fell on me
Id stay up nights on end howlin at the moon
While hounds of hell they ran with me
I dont know what it was that woke me from dream
It gave me back my life to save
All my friends that continued down that road
Well theyre crazy or in a cell or in a grave
I spent a life time in that world
I've seen some men go down real hard
I've heard them knockin on my door
I just cant go down that road no more
I just cant go down that road no more
Cause theres a darkness darker than black
So far gone you cant make it back
I spent a life time in that world
Ive seen some men go down real hard
Ive heard them knockin on my door
I just cant go down that road no more
I just cant go down that road no moreYou might also like
