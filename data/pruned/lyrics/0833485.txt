Pull me under
The world is at my feet
And it’s no wonder

Your eyes speak to me
They tell me be calm
They tell me be strong

Swimming out so deep
Now I can’t breathe
And it’s exactly where I belong

Cause it feels like the ride of a lifetime
And nothing’s gonna save us now
Let the waves come crashing down

Cause it feels like I’m right for the first time
And every time I take you in
I feel my heart skip a beat again
I'm drowning in your love

Love
It’s taking over
There's no in between to offer me some cover
Ohh oh
You might also likeThe tide is coming, I don't know if I can take it
I lose my focus, lose my focus
With every breath I feel my inhibition breaking
I can’t control it, no no no

Cause it feels like the ride of a lifetime
And nothing’s gonna save us now
Let the waves come crashing down

Cause it feels like I’m right for the first time
And every time I take you in
I feel my heart skip a beat again
I’m drowning in your love
