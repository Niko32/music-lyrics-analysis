Some people call it rock, some people call it roll
Some people call it boogie, some people call it soul
You can call it what you want, but it don't mean a thing
When the drummer starts a-cooking and the band begins to swing

[Chorus]
We're going to rock this joint
We're going to rock this joint tonight
We're going to burn up the floor and then we'll do it some more
We're going to rock this joint tonight
We're going to rock this joint
We're going to push it till it's clean out of sight
Me and the boys are going to make a little noise
We're going to rock this joint tonight

[Verse 2]
We're going to turn up the music and turn down the lights
Like we do it down in Dixie on a Saturday night
Open up the windows and turn up the heat
With a boggie woogie rocking rolling country kinda beat

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
We're going to rock it to the limit going to roll it right up to the wall
We're going to get up get down and have ourselves a natural ball you all
You might also like[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
So let's get jiggy with it that's all right
Grab somebody and hold on tight
Fasten your seat belt we're going for a ride
And if you ain't set to boogie then you'd better run and hide

[Chorus]
