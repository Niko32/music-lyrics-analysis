Oh
Oh
Yeah (Ooh, ooh, oh, oh)
You got me feeling crazy
It's like... just listen

[Verse 1 - Shannon]
What I got, couldn't feel any worse
It's like I'm possessed, under some kind of curse
Temperature on rise, I can't close my eyes
(I can't sleep at night and you're the reason why)

[Dawn]
Got my heart out in the cold (Breaker, breaker)
I'm afraid of getting broke (Operator, 'rator)

[D. Woods]
S-O-S, I'm overboard (Cause you threw me in the sea)
Please get the medic, somebody rescue me (Got that fever from you)

[Chorus - Danity Kane (Aubrey)]
Boy, can't breathe, bones are shaking (Ah)
Heavy spinning cause you make me (What?)
Boy, you make, see you make me
Ooh, you make me
You make me sick
Got the shivers when I'm near you
Call the doctor cause you make me, oh
Boy, you make, see you make me
Ooh, you make me
You make me sick
You might also like[Aubrey]
(Ha-choo) I'm allergic to your face
(So queasy even when I hear your name)
Dead on arrival from my self-denial
(I can't even breathe) Boy what you do to me

[D. Woods]
Got my heart out in the cold (Breaker, breaker)
Ooh, I'm afraid of getting broke, yeah (Operator, 'rator)

[Dawn (D. Woods)]
S-O-S, I'm overboard (Cause you threw me in the sea)
Please get the medic, somebody rescue me (Got that fever from you)

[Chorus - Danity Kane (Aubrey)]
Boy, can't breathe, bones are shaking (Ah)
Heavy spinning cause you make me (What?)
Boy, you make, see you make me
Ooh, you make me
You make me sick
Got the shivers when I'm near you
Call the doctor cause you make me, oh
Boy, you make, see you make me
Ooh, you make me
You make me sick
Boy, can't breathe, bones are shaking (Ah)
Heavy spinning cause you make me (What?)

[Bridge - Aundrea]
Mama said don't hate but your bitter pill
I can't get well cause you're keeping me ill
(I need a check-up or maybe some pills)
Cause I'm sick of your shit
So sick of you here

[Danity Kane]
Ah, ah, ah...
Queasy, shaky-shaky, got me spinning cause you make me sick
Ah, ah, ah...
Got that fever from you

Heavy spinning cause you make me (What?)
Boy, you make, see you make me

Got the shivers when I'm near you
Call the doctor cause you make me, oh
Boy, you make, see you make me
