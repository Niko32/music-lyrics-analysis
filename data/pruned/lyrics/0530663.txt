Mystical Magical
Ecstatical irradical
Call me the Krypton, cause superman be my victim
Corrupt System, listen, you missing the image, the imagination becomes your contemplation
Your minds on a vacation, don't understand relation
Which way you facing, wrong way sitting there blazing, Changing short days into a long advocation
Then realize how long you've been waiting
Discrimination of the uneducated,  Easy reading minds, it's time you would say it
Chasing the rhyme, amazing you think it's not mine

Align the poor, cause when I sort my assortion, the short warning of war, causing the cause the caution falling
Becomes nauseous like it's fucking extortion
Realizing it's a diversion, emerging a lyrical surgeon, the insertion of inertia
Becomes the conversion of extersion
When my lethal injection, becomes my own way of protection, insane minds in my projection,I'll teach you the lesson
Breaching the illiterate method, confessing by spitting shit, missed clinically expressing the
Define sickened ridiculed, confused the cynically abused, confined aggression of conspiracy
The mystery is infinity,  trinity in Tripoli,  serenity is an amenity
Imminently ridding the silly nigga,  medalling with poor confederates
Considering menacing medicines,  flickering the real symmetry, becomes more sickening
And near no fixing when in sticky predicaments, isn't it,  mixing the ignorance,  sixties configurance
Of missery, hypocritically blissening with no one listening
Strictly, sickened, sin, silly, sinful, similes, syballance
Alliteration is intimidation admittedly
Symaltanouesly insane, Acid BrainYou might also like
