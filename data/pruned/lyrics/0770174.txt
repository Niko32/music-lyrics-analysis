And I sing a simple song
I've never been so much in love
And never hurt so bad
At the same time
I am a simple girl
And I play a simple tune
I wish that I could see you
Once again across the room
Like the first time
I just wanna hold ya
I don't wanna hold ya down
I hear what you're saying'

And you're spinning my head around
And I can't make it alone
The ending of the tale
Is the singing of the song
All make me proud to be a woman;
Only you can make me strong
Like the last time
I just wanna hold ya
I don't wanna hold ya down
I hear what you're saying'
And you're spinning my head around
And I can't make it alone
I don't wanna make it alone...You might also like
