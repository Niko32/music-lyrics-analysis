Knows where to go keepin' it low down to the ground
A bottle of wine doctor good time he's got it all right
Stops for a while gives you that smile you're flying tonight

Said it's nice to know you
Hey, wouldn't you like to get around?
So much I could show you
Wouldn't you like to slow down?
The reggae man good for you
You never can see 'til you make it with me
The reggae man good for you
You'll never know why I can take you so high
The reggae man good for you
You never can tell 'til I'm ringing your bell
The reggae man good for you
Say the reggae man good for you

Nothing to say gets through the day sleepin' 'til late
Roll on the night hides from the light that's makin' him wait
Takin' his speed home growin' weed
Cortina E over the hill dressing to kill and easy to see
Said it's nice to know you
Hey, wouldn't you like to get around?
So much I could show you
Now wouldn't you like to slow down?
The reggae man good for you
You never can see 'til you make it with me
The reggae man good for you
You'll never know why I can take you so high
The reggae man good for you
You never can tell 'til I'm ringing your bell
The reggae man good for you
You know the reggae man good for you
You might also likeSaid it's nice to know you
