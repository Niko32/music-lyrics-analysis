Detonates in awe
Perfecting on this massacre
Trying to play god
Death and dissolution reigning
The blind leading the blind
And in darkness we are bound now
A sign of the times

I am become as death
Shatterer of worlds
Awaiting that hour
That ripens to their doom

Kali-Yuga
Age of iron

Liars lie in waiting
Killing without shame
Abominable powers be
Seeking one to blame
Aggressive dissidents we hunt
Ghosts of war torn pasts
As their thoughts are torn apart
Knowing they won't last
You might also likeI am become as death
Shatterer of worlds
Awaiting that hour
That ripens to their doom

Crowning jewel of our land
Detonates in awe
Perfecting on this massacre
Trying to play god
Death and dissolution reigning
The blind leading the blind
And in darkness we are bound now
A sign of the times

I am become as death
Shatterer of worlds
Awaiting that hour
That ripens to their doom
I am become a sword
Shatterer of lies
Awaiting that hour
That ripens to our doom

Kali-Yuga
Age of iron
