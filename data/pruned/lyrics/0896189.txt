Where the sun don't never shine
Than to be here alone just knowing that you're gone
As I slowly lose my mind

So blow your whistle freight train
Take me farther on down the track
I'm going away I'm leaving today
I'm going and I ain't coming back

I'd rather be in some dark holler
Where the sun don't never shine
Than to be in some big city
In a small room with your love on my mind

So blow your whistle freight train
Take me farther on down the track
I'm going away I'm leaving today
I'm going and I ain't coming back

I'd rather be in some dark holler
Where the sun don't never shine
Than to be here alone just knowing that you're gone
As I slowly lose my mind

So blow your whistle freight train
Take me farther on down the track
I'm going away I'm leaving today
I'm going and I ain't coming back
