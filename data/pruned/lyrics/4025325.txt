Uh, let's start off with something light
You bringin' the candle light
That I put aside sometime
Tell me what you say 'cause you know I got it baby
I wanna call you, I wanna leave it up
You feel the same, so I know that you exchange this
I need some play boy baby I get on my way, ay

[Chorus]
Way, way, wakin' me up
Way, way, puttin' me down
Babe, babe you know how I like it
I can tear it down
Way, way, wakin' me up
Way, way, puttin' me down
Wait, wait, I came to show you something you gon' need, yeah
You know, 'cause you know I know it
(You know, 'cause you know I know it)

[Verse 2]
Typically not the girl out your league
I know that I'm not just like them other girls
But I can lead you to something that they can't see
Something stable if you trust me, but you won't (Yeah, yeah)
I'm callin' you out to see
You wheeling me in, you
I know what this means to you
And it's feeling right but I-
Slick needed a reason why
I waited so long, but you
Tell me don't fight it, you, oh baby
You might also like[Bridge]
You always calling 'bout something
You always wanted my way
I gotta catch you on something
You gotta be tired of playing games
I wanna talk about something
I wanna get it my way
I need you here by my something
I need you here by today, yeah
Yeah, but you got it, but you got it
Boy tell me what's my name, boy tell me what's my name

[Outro]
'Cause you hit me with the late night text
