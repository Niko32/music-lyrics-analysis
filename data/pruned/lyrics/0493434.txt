[Hook]
Don’t wanna drive
I don’t wanna drive home
I said I don’t wanna drive home
I said I don’t wanna drive home
I don’t wanna drive home
No, no
I don’t wanna drive home
I said I don’t wanna drive home
I don’t wanna drive home
I said I don’t wanna drive home

[Verse 1]
Tonight it was, so magical
You and I, no one knows
What we got goin’ on
Between the sheets, you breakin’ me off
And after all is said and done
My man’s at home, I gotta run
So I grab my keys and attempted to leave
Then I put them down and what I told him was
[Hook]

[Verse 2]
He asked me why I wanted to stay
I told him my man’s been playin’ games
But don’t get me wrong, I don’t need you
To be my man, I’m not confused
And after all is said and done
My man’s at home, I gotta run
Though I grabbed my keys and attempted to leave
But then I put them down and what I told him was

[Hook]
