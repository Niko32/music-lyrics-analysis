(Swiff D)

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Trey Songz]
I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby (You, baby)
But your body like that Cali kush, your pussy, I just gotta blaze it (Gotta blaze it)
To tell the truth, wish it was you in this booth that I could play with (I could play with)
So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby (Babe)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, Trey Songz]
Girl, I call Balenciaga, made it just for you, baby
Know you like that Coco, oh, the purse came with the shoes, baby
Lick you from your neck down to your toes, how that pussy tastin'?
Kiss you anywhere you want to the song, while the record playin'

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Trey Songz]
Girl, I'm just sittin' in the studio, thinkin' 'bout that booty, oh
And I'm just switchin' up positions while you makin' all kinda faces
Got you trippin', caught you slippin', now you drippin' all down the basement
So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby

[Verse 2: Chris Brown, Trey Songz, Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
You need a real nigga, don't it? Who gon' hit it 'til the mornin'?
I'ma put the mic up to your mouth, I need some vocals on it
Baby girl, we about to make love
On this floor, right now, now, now, now
Baby, we're all up in the studio
Hit record right now, now, now, now
Baby, I'm about to buss, no gunplay, hunnid-fifty on the one-way
Baby, tryna go to work like Monday, melt your body like a sundae
Baby, I'm caught up in the moment, see I
Raw dog, I done thought about it a couple times
Ass up when the shit go down
Got her bussin' like a pistol now

So I'm just sittin' in the studio just tryna get to you, baby (Babe)
