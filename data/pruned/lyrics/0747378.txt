It's three in the morning and i'm itchin' to write
Flinching when i see the lights of the clock
Hear the horns on the block
Comin' round the corner like he's being chased by the cops
But he's not, no he's not
Just a shout to stop is what i give out
Twist the cap in the opposite direction now
Mr. Green was right it's gonna get out
Inspired, occupied and I could really use some sleep but how?
It's been three days i'm tired
Of the lack of triple Z's that are acquired
Feeling numb
And the easy part is done, now who was the lighter?
Cuz i'm taking too long to fix the spiders on the lines
Twisting words up like some vines, Tight
Keep in mind all the times my dreams were right
I could tell the future if I could just turn out the lights


[Verse 2-Matty G]
Approaching slowly and grossly sporting assorted groceries
Bored stiff or stiff from boarding doors in his homery
Fuckin' with keys in pockets to rocket a sense of urgency
OK here's where things get interesting
Panic button situated with grace at the base
Of his hollow mainframe, poised for the play
It's all day
Dark matter, Dark magic, dark happenings at the hatchery
Where incubated evil disguises new and shiny things
Mommy's little monster with eyes baptized in mercury
Spent his days in the nursery, severing every puppet string
Exacting calculated footsteps on blacktop
Slack jawed hacksaw, overly prone to trash talk
Chatter box, awkward topics, bus stop shit
The synopsis of plot twists is bound to get complex and scrambled
Doped up higher than roman candles
In my bedroom building bombs to dismantle
Change the channel

It's 3 in the morning and i'm itchin to fight
I got my wrists tied tight and it's hard to write
And now it's 4 in the morning and i'm itching to write
I got my wrists tied tight and it's hard to fight
And now it's 5 in the morning and i'm itchin to fight
I got my wrists tied tight and it's hard to write
In my room using cats as a measurement of time
Turn out the light
Turn out the light

[Verse 3-Astela]
My page is lookin too clean, I can pass the Yankee white
So I'ma rock the situation room any time i need to write
Gotta get away, get some privacy from life
Must be nice
Confidence wins the gold but not tonight
Not Kentucky land but were growing close to ripe
I think he was right
I think Jerry lost his mind
Now it's 5 in the morning, I'll be awake and all for it
I'm even feeling euphoric, the neighbor's is all creakin'
And I can hear em' snoring while i'm thinking
Of every word worried if I'm on blast or getting boring
I'm a lurker in the evening
I be creepin'
Indulgence is what he's reaping
If anything Mr. Jones, recommend a book to read man
I need to go to sleep kid every blink I'm thinking
That i'm just dreaming and i'm friends with the demon
But i'm not, no I'm not, I'm awake
Hugging pages that are blank
Go to sleep little Nemo it's getting late
[Verse 4-Matty G]
Matter of fact, Matty G is back on the map
Itchin to get in after spending several days in the lab
Where he was cuttinng and gutting intestines
Knotted then kept and collected
Back up the raw data to peck at the records
Cuz he don't trust computers those metadata commuters
So good for bad news and satisfying consumers
Click click click, ordering flicks chicks and clips
With one click the bug fixed, labeled a glitch
So i post and play quiet, no data stream diet
And shirk the outskirts when writers incite riots
While they tuned into a vibrant sea of waves on the tube
I'm in the booth making moves that can be hard to compute
Wearing a war mask tasked with bringing a severed head back
Meticulously slaying purveyors of riff raff
And if i make it back bruised black, bones intact
I'll be walking a tight wire too tired to bring the beat back

[Chorus]
It's 3 in the morning and i'm itchin to fight
I got my wrists tied tight and it's hard to write
And now it's 4 in the morning and i'm itching to write
I got my wrists tied tight and it's hard to fight
And now it's 5 in the morning and i'm itchin to fight
I got my wrists tied tight and it's hard to write
In my room using cats as a measurement of time
Turn out the light
Turn out the light
Goodnight
