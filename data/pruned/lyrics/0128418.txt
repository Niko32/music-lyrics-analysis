And if I had someone to love me
And if I had someone who really cared
I would be the best lover that they ever had
Cause I need somebody to love me, love back
Yes I do
And if I had one sunny day
And if I had someone to chase my blues away
I would be, I would be the luckiest man in the whole wide world
Cause I need somebody just to love me, love be back
See I need to lose this empty feeling
Someone to start to need somebody to stop these endless nights
I need some to love (Would you hold me)
And hold real tight (Would you hold me)
Somebody to love me (Would you hold me, would you hold me, hold me, hold me)
Somebody just to love me
If I only had, if I only had someone that
I need, I need somebody just to hold my handYou might also like
