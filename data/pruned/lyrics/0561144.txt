Redman tobacco, Grandpa's two cents
Old timers, "there in a pinch"
I'm a fan of it, old shit
Splittin logs, smokin hogs
Feedin leftovers to a three legged dog
I'm a fan of it, old shit

[Chorus]
One man's trash is another man's treasure
One man's pain is another man's pleasure
If it's out of style, sure drives me wild
I'm a fan of it, old shit

[Verse 2]
Old turntables, vinyl records
Hand me down tools, Black and Decker
I'm a fan of it, old shit

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Singin hymns, skippin stones
When I think of him I think of home
I'm a fan of it, old shit
You might also like[Modified Chorus/Outro]
Now grandpa's trash is my treasure
He don't feel pain, only pleasure
If it's out of style, sure drove him wild
So I'm a fan of it, old shit
Yeah I'm a fan of it, old shit
