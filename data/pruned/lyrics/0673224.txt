Thought I heard you call my name
Though we share the same mother
I know things ain’t been the same

When the fiends of the world are calling
Will you be my friend, my friend, my friend

And it’s hard to see you dying
When I’m feeling so alive
Saw a chorus of angels
Singing songs about old hearts

We’ve all got secrets
But I’m the one to blame
I stand by the street at night
Wondering if we’ll be okayYou might also like
