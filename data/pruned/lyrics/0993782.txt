In the Wildwood where the Bluebells grew
With the Merry widow waltz singing
Take me back to New York town
When the birds in Georgia sing of Tennessee
Fifty miles from Boston
When a fellow's on the level with a girl
That's on the square
That's the talk of New York town

I've got rings on my fingers!
I saw a show called Carrie Marry Harry
Down among the sugar cane
Listen Lester
When a fellow's on the level with a girl
That's on the square
The longest way round is the sweetest way home;
I wonder who's kissing her now

In Brattleboro VT performing
With the People's Choral Union
The longest way round is the sweetest way home
With the Merry widow waltz
At the fatal wedding
The Dalton boys ran a simple game
I've got rings on my fingers
See saw, Margery Daw

Performing with the People's Choral Union
Where Death got married til nothing 'cept
Yourself do you part
I've got rings on my fingers
Nobody Knows, Nobody cares
Listen Lester
The Dalton boys ran a simple game
Where my Caravan has rested
See saw, Margery Daw

With the Japanese Tragedienne
And the old Nestor Company at the Blondeau Tavern
At the New Amsterdam Theatre playing 'A Parisian Romance'
Down among the sugar cane
The man who owns Broadway up in a Balloon
I saw a show called Carrie Marry Harry
I wonder who's kissing her now

In the Wildwood where the Bluebells grew
That's the talk of New York town
When the birds in Georgia sing of Tennessee
Take me round again
When a fellow's on the level with a girl
That's on the square
Singing take me back to New York town
With the scandal of the Honduras Lottery
Fifty miles from Boston
Listen Lester
I've got rings on my fingers
Nobody Knows, Nobody cares
Where my Caravan has rested
The Dalton boys ran a simple game
In Brattleboro VT performing with the
People's Choral Union
See saw, Margery Daw
