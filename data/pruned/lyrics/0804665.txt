Strangers nor the best of friends
Well I can find it easily
I'd assume that it'd find me

I ain't attached to what I got
And I'm sure likin' what I see
I'd follow you to Little Rock
But Tulsa sounds like trouble to me
Tulsa sounds like trouble to me

Had me a gal in Tulsa once
One day I took her out to lunch
I got up, excused myself
And fell in love with someone else

I ain't attached to what I got
And I'm sure likin' what I see
I'd follow you to Little Rock
But Tulsa sounds like trouble to me
Tulsa sounds like trouble to me

I love them Oklahoma hills
I always have, I always will
Got an itch to call 'em home
But I'd live longer stayin' gone
You might also likeI ain't attached to what I got
And I'm sure likin' what I see
I'd follow you to Little Rock
But Tulsa sounds like trouble to me
Tulsa sounds like trouble to me

Yeah, it's a big ol' country here
I rambled it from ear to ear
There's places I'm still welcome in
But Tulsa it ain't one of them
Tulsa it ain't one of them

I ain't attached to what I got
And I'm sure likin' what I see
I'd follow you to Little Rock
But Tulsa sounds like trouble to me
Tulsa sounds like trouble to me
Tulsa sounds like trouble to me
