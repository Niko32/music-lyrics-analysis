Lashing out but renounced by myself I can't let it out
Pure sedation has bleached all the hurt that I feel inside
Clean myself off from all of the rage still I come alive

Wake up all the time I'm sick and sore and tired of all the things I could have been
'Cuz this is what I really am and I can't change now

All this time I have tried to replace what I'm all about
Blistered inside I feel my compassion is burning out
Violate my own instincts to live in this fucking world
I've done all that I can to recoil yet I come alive

Wake up all the time I'm sick and sore and tired of all the things I could have been
'Cuz this is what I really am and I can't change nowYou might also like
