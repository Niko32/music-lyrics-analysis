Remember words i spoke to you when i was wrong
And you said that that's okay
Wait now i know its much too late to play along, cause you could see

I got these holes in my pockets and time on my hands
And i don't know where to put them, i just hope you'd understand
That i'm scared of where i'm going cause i don't like where i've been
And i never felt quite comfortable in my own skin

When these walls could fall, i left no room at all for you to breathe
They say this rain could wash away all these days, but i know it can't get what's underneath
And you could see

I got these holes in my pockets and time on my hands
And i don't know where to put them, i just hope you'd understand
That i'm scare of where i'm going cause i don't like where i've been
And i never felt quite comfortable in my own skin

And you could see the best in meYou might also like
