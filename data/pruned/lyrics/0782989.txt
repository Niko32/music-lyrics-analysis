Scrape from the floor, bodies butchered and torn
Faith principal, weapons of violent dissent
Blood filling the streets, feel it on your own skin
Screaming out to die
Dead before you were born
Slaughter governs us all
Beware the coming storm
Savage intent, predacious instinct to kill
Fear outspread, pile of innocent dead
Eye for an eye, suicide servant of god
Shock, searing flesh, humanity praying for deathYou might also like
