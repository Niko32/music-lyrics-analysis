I hope it shines on me
And gives me everything...well, almost
Some people seem
To be just small hard peas
Sometimes I think it's me

I try so hard for bruises on your back - just to get you back
I try so hard for bruises on your back, tiny and mean
Just to get you back
Just to get you back
Just to get you back
Just to get you back

When I see the sun
I hope it shines on me
And gives me everything
To be one mile high
Then I would kill you all
What I gave to you, just meant nothing
When I see the sun
I hope it shines on me
And gives me everything
When I see the sun
I hope it shines on me
And gives me everything...well, almostYou might also like
