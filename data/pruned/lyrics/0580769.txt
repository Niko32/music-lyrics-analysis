Away from her fireside at night;
And never go roaming out after the boys
But would sit by her fireside so bright
My wife, she is one of a different kind
Often caused me a lot of grief
She's oft' from her home
And she leaves me alone
To rock all our babies to sleep

Just the other night while out for a walk
I happened to stroll down the street
And to my surprise
I saw with me eyes
My wife with a man of six feet
She says, "It's no harm don't raise no alarm
Don't make any fuss on the street."
She tickled my chin
Told me to go in
And rock all our babies to sleep

I remember one night when I came back home
I came in as quiet as a lamb
They must have had comp'ny for when I walked in
I heard the back door when it slammed
I walked right in and looked all around
I never thought that she would cheat
Without a doubt she had just gone out
And left all our babies asleepYou might also like
