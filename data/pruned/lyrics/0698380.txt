My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And everyone knows she's fine

[Verse 1]
She blesses all that she sees
A toss of her hair and a kiss in the breeze
But she don't love no one but me
And I can't believe she's mine
Shimmering she moves
Sunlight all around her
Even when she's blue
Silver clouds surround her

[Chorus]
My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And I can't believe she's mine

[Verse 2]
My baby swings down the street
Big, tall high-heel shoes on her feet
Walks by and my heart skips a beat
And I'm stumbling like a fool
She give me something so sweet
I can't sleep, y'all, and I can't eat
Sparks fly whenever we meet
I'm breathless 'cause she's so cool
You might also like[Bridge]
Anywhere she goes
I can only follow
She'll be there, I know
When I awake tomorrow

[Chorus]
My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And everyone knows she's fine

[Chorus]
My baby sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
Sparkle and shine
My baby sparkle and shine
And everyone knows she's fine
And everyone knows she's mine
