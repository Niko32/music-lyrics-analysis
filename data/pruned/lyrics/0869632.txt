Look at the sky on fire
Who struck the match?
Who fanned the flames?
Everyone's pointin' a finger
'Cause nobody cares for the blame, no no
See the clouds getting thicker
Cry out to God as the embers burn
Said it's too late for redemption
Read all the books but they never learn, no, no

[Chorus]
Love is a compass
It will turn you around 180 degrees
The arc of a rainbow
It's a promise made
It's a promise kept
Let's walk two by two
The arc of a rainbow

[Verse 2]
Feels like a thief in the night
Came and carried your blanket away
You keep reachin' for cover
Because you're as naked as a new born babe, yeah, yeah
Got your eyes wide open but you can't really see a thing
Staring up at an old moon
So afraid of what the season will bring oh, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
Love is a compass
It will turn you around 180 degrees
The arc of a rainbow
It's a promise made
It's a promise kept
Let's walk two by two
(Let's walk two by two)
The arc of a rainbow
(Let's walk two by two)

[Verse 3]
Everyday is a revelation
Hear a trumpet, see a kingdom come
They can build us a fortress
But fear it won't protect us from, no, no
If it's a matter of time
Well then time oughta matter more
I think it's already over
If the end is all you're waiting for

[Chorus]
Love is a compass
It will turn you around 180 degrees
The arc of a rainbow
Each tear is a prism
Hope is a ray of light
Let's walk two by two
The arc of a rainbow, yeah
Love is a compass
It will turn you around 180 degrees
The arc of a rainbow
It's a promise made
It's a promise kept
Let's walk two by two
The arc of a rainbow
(Let's walk two by two)
The arc of a rainbow
(Let's walk two by two)
The arc of a rainbow
(Let's walk two by two)
