Gucci (Gucci)
What's up, Corey?
Back in the trap
Heavy, real heavy, it's so heavy
Heavy, real heavy
Gucci
Gucci (Gucci, Gucci)
(Go!)

[Chorus]
Heavy, real heavy, it feels heavy (Yeah)
Somebody help me, my neck hurt, my chain heavy (Brr, brr, brr)
Heavy, dough heavy, flow heavy
Gucci bag full of cash, it's so heavy (Gucci)
Lessen, I can't let it, I go get it
My ego gettin' too big, it's too heavy (Ow, ow)
My head gettin' too big, it's so heavy (Ow, ow)
Somebody help me to tote this cash, it's too heavy
Heavy

[Verse 1]
My bitch say every time she look up, I'm about to do a cook-up
I told her if she know like I know, she would shut the fuck up (Fuck)
Introduced Cola to soda and I said, "Y'all need to hook up" (Skrrt)
I pimp that white girl like a motherfuckin' hooker (Skrrt)
I took three hundred out my stash and I went and bought a Phantom (Wow)
I need some toilet paper, I'm the shit in East Atlanta
On a ninety day tour, so my niggas really miss me (Yeah)
I couldn't kick it with 'em, so I took my whole hood with me (Gucci)
And I just got out of jail, yeah, they tried to Michael Vick me (Yeah)
I gave my lawyer half a mill' and told him, "Come and get me" (Yeah)
I'm not with G-Unit, but this drum here cost me fifty (Brr)
This chain another fifty, that's a hundred on you snitches
You might also like[Chorus]
Heavy, real heavy, it feels heavy (Yeah)
Somebody help me, my neck hurt, my chain heavy (Brr, brr, brr)
Heavy, dough heavy, flow heavy
Gucci bag full of cash, it's so heavy (Gucci)
Lessen, I can't let it, I go get it
My ego gettin' too big, it's too heavy (Ow, ow)
My head gettin' too big, it's so heavy (Ow, ow)
Somebody help me to tote this cash, it's too heavy
Heavy

[Verse 2]
I'm so confused, don't have a clue, man, what to do?
Should I rob him or should I serve him? You know the rules
I keep Miami heat, got more straps than a gun show
Run up on the kid, I'll have you mourning like Alonzo
Try me if you want to, I'll send my shooters pronto (Go)
I know you'll die, but hell or heaven, don't know where you're gonna go
Run up on me wrong, try your luck 'cause I don't think so (No)
This four-four that I tote'll leave a hole size of a pothole (Wow)
Yeah, I got amigo, but they don't bring me taco
Only bring me kilos, but keep that on the D-low
I'm gettin' my tip fade cut, Bouldercrest and Flat Shoals
Wish a nigga would run up on me like I'm Brisco

[Chorus]
Heavy, real heavy, it feels heavy (Yeah)
Somebody help me, my neck hurt, my chain heavy (Brr, brr, brr)
Heavy, dough heavy, flow heavy
Gucci bag full of cash, it's so heavy (Gucci)
Lessen, I can't let it, I go get it
My ego gettin' too big, it's too heavy (Ow, ow)
My head gettin' too big, it's so heavy (Ow, ow)
Somebody help me to tote this cash, it's too heavy
Heavy
[Verse 3]
I went and picked up me a hundred pack and I ain't even finished (Yeah)
I'm rentin' this duplex in the six, I only use the kitchen (Skrrt)
I'm insane with my grind-up post, yeah, I got big bags of smoke (Yeah)
You fuck niggas don't call my phone unless you wanna buy some dope
I got birds like Atlanta zoo, bitch, who are you?
I got goons like a scary movie, yeah, that is true
And I change cars like a rich white girl change shoes
Gotta go, go get this lil' money, lil' cuz wanna deuce (Skrrt)
And I was holdin' number thirty-two, 2002, you know it's true
Bottom of Sun Valley juggin', me and Juice, you know the crew
I got money stacked from last June, and I still ain't spent old bread
If you want, I'll gladly pour some change on ya own head (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Heavy, real heavy, it feels heavy (Yeah)
Somebody help me, my neck hurt, my chain heavy (Brr, brr, brr)
Heavy, dough heavy, flow heavy
Gucci bag full of cash, it's so heavy (Gucci)
Lessen, I can't let it, I go get it
My ego gettin' too big, it's too heavy (Ow, ow)
My head gettin' too big, it's so heavy (Ow, ow)
Somebody help me to tote this cash, it's too heavy (Yeah)
