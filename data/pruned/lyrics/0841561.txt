You know that sparkle in my eyes is from the light you shine
Yeah you make me complete
Bring out the best in me
And when I am blind, you help me to see
All of the things that I'm supposed to be
A girl like you is hard to fine, one of a kind
I'm just glad that you're mine
I'm glad that you're mine
When I am down you come around and make me want to live
I'll give you anything and everything I have to give
But you're love is all I need
Your love makes me be me
Is there something I've done to warrant your love
Was there something I said, to merit your touch
Cause I'll say it again, my lover and friend
I'm glad that you're mine
I'm glad that you're mine
Yeah when the roof gets blown off and the shit hits the fan
Girl I promise you now I'm gonna still be your man
A girl like you is hard to find, one of a kind
I'm glad that you're mine
I'm glad that you're mineYou might also like
