Well, let me tell you about a song that's just right to put you all in a good mood. It's the old Bob Wills' number "Bring It On Down To My House, Honey" and if I can just hit on the fiddle, it goes like this

One, two, a one, two, three
[Chorus]
Bring it on down to my house, honey
There ain't nobody home but me
Bring it on down to my house, honey
I need your company

[Verse]
Aunt Claudy went to town to buy a new slip
Uncle John went fishing on a three-day trip
Bring it on down to my house, honey
Ain't nobody home but me

[Chorus]
Bring it on down to my house, honey
There ain't nobody home but me
Bring it on down to my house, honey
I need your company

[Verse]
Your mama won't fret, if you bring it over here
Preacher won't know and the neighbors don't care
So bring it on down to my house, honey
Ain't nobody home but me
You might also like[Chorus]
Bring it on down to my house, honey
Ain't nobody home but me
Bring it on down to my house, honey
I need your company

[Verse]
Well, I'll come around if you can play the fiddle
Bring it on down 'cause I can play a little
Bring it on down to my house, honey
There ain't nobody home but me

[Chorus]
Bring it on down to my house, honey
There ain't nobody home but me
Bring it on down to my house, honey
I need your company

[Verse]
I'll come around if you can play the fiddle
Well, bring it on down 'cause I can play a little
Bring it on down to my house, honey
Ain't nobody home but me
