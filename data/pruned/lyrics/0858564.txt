Alright
Walkin' through the tall grass
Down to the riverbed
Gonna wade in the water
Wash away my sins
Walkin' through the tall grass
Down to the riverbed
Gonna wade in the water
Wash away my sins
Help me Jesus
Help me Jesus
Gonna put my head beneath the healing water
Wash clean every inch of my soul
Gonna put my head beneath the healing water
Wash clean every inch of my soul
Help me Jesus
Help me Jesus
Gonna put my head beneath the healing water
And wash clean every inch of my soul
I felt the devil staring over my shoulder
He followed me from the old crossroads
Help me Jesus
Help me Jesus
Help me Jesus
Help me Jesus
Walkin' through the tall grass
Down to the riverbed
Gonna wade in the water
Wash away my sins
