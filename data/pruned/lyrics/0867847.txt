Mommy and Daddy won't be sorry they had me anymore
Outside I'm smilin', outside I'm crying that's for sure
Sittin' at home all by myself eating my birthday cake
And I don't wanna be crazy, I just can't be crazy anymore

I'm public enemy in my home town
Parents tell their kids not to say my name out loud
No one's ever gonna look me in the eyes anymore
Ain't gonna gimme no keys to the city anymore
Hearin' sounds, can't shut it off, radio ain't on
And I don't wanna be crazy, I just can't be crazy anymore

Everyone's pointing fingers at me
Shouldn't they look at someone else
I couldn't've done all the things that they say
It musta been someone else
And I don't wanna be crazy, I just can't be crazy anymore
