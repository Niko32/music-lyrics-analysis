Money making
Music dealers and killers
Stop faking
We iller we realler
Kill you in a verse
Kill you in a bar
We got the world in our galaxy
That's how you know the world is are's
I've been ill since the illest (that's me)
I've been real since the reallest
Since my name was kid DC
Trying to make my name known
So you know I got the best flow
And your girl looks me up when she's alone at home
Polo boys entertainment
Shout out to kid Choppa
Stay switching lanes and
Got that music that will rock ya'
Choppo bandz is my manz
Antonio got them hands
And Hellatwist got the power to make a white girl dance
We hotter then all you other crews
(Y'all Lame)
Don't mess with any of our dudes
I just might aim
While y'all watchin Pokemon
And playin bakugan
Step up out the octagon
And don't go runnin to your mom

Polo boys are the players
Broke boys are the haters
Because they ain't stacking paper
I'm stacking plastic and paper
Got it all on my card
D.C
That is my yard
Better crank this joint hard
And better not disregard
I'm killin every single beat
I'm future your obsolete
Y'all broken and incomplete
Got this track on repeat
When you hear it in the street
They're all yellin
Kid P
Kid Pe$o
That is me so hot I overheat

[Kid Choppa]
Kid Choppa and Pe$o
Steady gettin cake though
PBE trying to get out here
Ain't trying to catch a case though
PBE
We in it
We're spaced out and were winning
Because there's compitition
Because the game is a game
It ain't nothing but a obstacle
PBE trynna get this money
Yea we trying to get our pockets full
And I be killing wack rappers
Because there nothing but fools
And I don't care if I win or lose
I will always be on top
I will overheat
I will make the pressure reach the top
