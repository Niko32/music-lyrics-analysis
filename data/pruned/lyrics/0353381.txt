Runnin' This Thing,Scared To Jump The Hurdles
Keep A Couple Real Niggas In My Fuckin' Circle
Imma Bout To Lose My Mind ,Bouncing Off The Walls
Sixteen Years Old,And I Want It All

(Hook)
Back And Fourth, Back And Fourth, Back And Fourth,Uh
Back And Fourth, Back And Fourth, Back And Fourth,Uh
Back And Fourth, Back And Fourth, Back And Fourth,Uh
Back And Fourth, Back And Fourth, Back And Fourth,Uh

(Verse 2)
People Say I Suck And I Sound Like Shit
Thought I Was Gonna Quit,But I Never Quit
This Is My Life,This is How I Run Shit
Niggas Say They Get It In But They Never Done Shit
Sixteen Years Old,they say I'm Too Young
I Got Too Serious,Tryna have Fun
This Is my Life,This is my Fuckin' Dream
If you Ain't Real,You Don't Know What I Fuckin' Mean

(Verse 3)
World So Blue,But It Look Purple
Keep A Couple Friends In My Mutha Fuckin' Circle
Can't Trust People Nowadays They Fuckin' Fake
Can't Look Back,Because I'm Tryna Look Stright
This Is my City,I Do It For Tampa
Keep These Bitches On Me,Bitches call Me Santa
Fuck What you Gossip,Its just A Rumor
Until My Time Come,Imma Fucin' Loser
People Like To Try Me,So I Can't Be Happy
Hate This Position,Got Me Feelin' Crappy
They Say I Make Them Sick,Like A Fuckin' Cold
They Said I Sound Rotten,Like A Piece Of Mold
