Rap-A-Lot Mafia, worldwide we out to stay rich
Now you can see us in the drop we party non-stop
Recognize the mob, before we make your spot hot
Tell me who got the hot hits?
Rap-A-Lot Mafia, worldwide we mob thick
Now you can see us in the drop we party non-stop
Recognize the mob, when the club clothes we hit the parking lot

Verse 1:
Young Driza, Northside rider, straight outta 5th ward
Hooked up wit Lil' J Prince????????
Ain't no muthafuckin' questions Feds watching this shit
No weapons formed against us shall prosper, ain't stopping shit
12 years in the business Rap-A-Lot at its finest
Every muthafuckin' where we go dem' Feds behind us
They got they cameras out taking pictures itchin' to get us
Fuck dem' muthafuckin' devils cause they can't fuck with us
Niggas gettin' that legit paper
They wanna rape us like they did during slavery days
When they was brought up to hate us
We got thug niggas cocked with Glocks
Bleeding the block
Bustin' hollow point slugs
If dem' Feds jump out
Educate niggas on the street to pack that heat
In case dem' hoes wanna try and turn this bitch into a swap meet
Exchangin' rounds of rapid-fire is every thugs desire
If dem' Feds blast first we settin' they ass on fire
You might also like(Chorus)

Once again, fuck the feds, cause the mans like us
If them hoes grab they gat don't hesitate to bust
Cause if they bust first then you don't getta chance to bust back
And thats the end of anotha' precious soul thats black
They started off selling niggas like carpency
They still trying to kill us off cause they want us extinct
Fuck the muthafuckin' president, fuck the government
And fuck dem' other dumb-ass niggas thats loving it
Cause Northside thug niggas love to bust
Straight out the 5th Ward the Feds can't fuck with us
Harrasing all our lil' homies, setting guns in they shirt
Catch dem' hoes by themselves and beat em' til they purple
Niggas tired of being exploited and prosecuted
Take dem' hoes hang em' up high and excecute em'
Fair exchange ain't no robbery
I know exactly how dem' hoes operate so dis' shit don't bother me

(Chorus)

The hate to see an all black own establishment
With thug niggas from the street representing and shit
Mob about a hundred deep every where we go
In stretch hummer, stretch navigators and stretch benzos
With platinum drop benzes
Puttin' icing on our cake
Thats the reason why the muhfuckin' government hate us
Cause niggas doing they thug thang no more minimum wages
This rap shit getting us paid but they want us enslaved
I be damn if i render my service estimated at $5.00 an hour
This cowards better be nervous
Be on the lookout for a thug nigga strap wit'  a gat
Ain't no mothefuckin' return so don't look back
I'm taking everything that ain't bolted down
Thats how these northside muhfuckin' thug do this shit  in H-town
