The night is comin'
As I receive within
A cold wind's blowin'
I can't seem to hear above the din
The voices take me as I am
But I can't move from where I stand

The sky is fallin'
And I keep stallin'
A voice is callin'

And I can't go on
Without you knowin'
That I surrender to you
Though I may never have you

And I can't go on
Without you knowin'
That as they bury me
It's just the monster I've become

I gave it up in ignorance
And words I never said
All I'm left is an empty room
And your words inside my head
You might also likeAnd I would fall from where I stand
But I have nowhere left to land

So I keep movin'
Away from everythin'
And into nothin'

And I can't go on
Without you knowin'
That I surrender to you
Though I may never have you

And I can't go on
Without you knowin'
I'd only bury you
Because you buried me too

And now I go on
Ever knowin'
That when I cheated you
I only cheated myself

And I can't go on
Without you knowin'
That it was never you
And now it's ever you
As you go on
The sky is fallin'
The night is comin'
As I receive within
As you go on
A cold wind's blowin'
I can't seem to hear above the din

And I can't go on
Without you knowin'
That I surrender to you
Though I may never have you

And I can't go on
Without you knowin'
I'd only bury you
Because you buried me too

And now I go on
The sky is fallin'
The night is comin'
Ever knowin'
As I receive within
That when I cheated you
A cold wind's blowin'
I can't seem to
I only cheated myself
Hear above the din
And I can't go on
I gave it up in ignorance
Without you knowin'
And words I never said
That it was never you
All I'm left is an empty room
And now it's ever you
And your words inside my head

And I can't go on
The sky is fallin'
The night is comin'
Without you knowin'
As I receive within
That it was never you
I just had to tell you
