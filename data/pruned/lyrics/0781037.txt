It was a time like no one else has ever had
We learned to drive, we learned to fly
We sent a man into the sky
When he walked on the moon, we were so glad
Yeah, the twentieth century wasn't all that bad

Yeah, the twentieth century was quite a ride
We had to learn to see the other side
We had demonstrations and liberations
Great depressions and good vibrations
And doors that once were closed were opened wide
Oh, the twentieth century was quite a ride

We had movin' pictures and radio
And Broadway, country, rock and roll
In 1900, who'd a bet we'd all be surfing on the internet

Yeah, the twentieth century was a heck of a show
We all had our fifteen minutes, don't you know
Assembly lines, celebrities
The spotlight shined on you and me
And everybody got a standin' O
Yeah, the twentieth century was a heck of a show

From blocks of ice to air-condition
Telegraph to television
In 1900, who'd a known we all wind up with pocket phones
You might also likeThe twentieth century wasn't all that long
Just a hundred years has come and gone
We can't go back even if we try
So I'll just smile and wave goodbye
To see it leavin' makes me kinda sad
It was a time like no one else has ever had
Oh, the twentieth century wasn't all that bad

The twentieth century
Bye-bye

The twentieth century
Goodbye...
