You left me a horse from Texas
A house with installments due
A letter with lots of X's
Everything but you

[Verse 2]
You left me some beans from Boston
A bicycle built for two
A memory to get lost in
Everything but you

[Bridge]
Each day was so gay and so daring
I loved every breathtaking minute
How could I know I was sharing
A kiss without a future in it?

[Verse 3]
You left me a dream to room with
A coffee pot from Peru
A knife and a fork to spoon with

[Bridge]
Each day was so gay, baby
I loved every minute
How could I know I was sharing
A kiss without a future in it?

I've got a me a dream to room with
Where I've got me a coffee pot from Peru
Yes, and I've got me a knife and a fork to spoon with
Everything but you
Everything but you

[Outro]
I've got everything I need but you
