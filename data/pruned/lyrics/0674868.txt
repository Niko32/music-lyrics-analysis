They're working while I'm missing you
Those healing hands of time
Soon they'll be dismissing you
From this heart of mine
They'll lead me safely through the night
And I'll follow as though blind
My future tightly clutched within
Those healing hands of time
They let me close my eyes just then
Those healing hands of time
And soon I'll learn to sleep again
Those healing hands of time
Already I've reached mountain top
And I've just just begun my climb
I'll get over you by clinging to
Those healing hands of time

[Outro]
I'll get over you by clinging to
Those healing hands of timeYou might also like
