Said goodbye to his mama as he left South Dakota
To fight for the red, white, and blue
He was 19 and green with a new M-16
Just doin' what he had to do
He was dropped in the jungle where the choppers would rumble
With the smell of napalm in the air
And the sergeant said "Look up ahead"
Like a dark evil cloud, 1,200 came down on him and 29 more
They fought for their lives but most of them died in the 173rd Airborne

[Chorus]
On the 8th of November the angels were cryin'
As they carried his brothers away
With the fire rainin' down and the hell all around
There were few men left standing that day
Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky
1965, the 8th of November

[Verse 2]
Now he's 58 and his pony tail's gray
But the battle still plays in his head
He limps when he walks but he's strong when he talks
About the Shrapnel they left in his leg
He puts on a gray suit over his Airborne tattoo
And he ties it on one time a year
And remembers the fallen as he orders a tall one
And swallows it down with his tears
You might also like[Chorus]
On the 8th of November the angels were cryin'
As they carried his brothers away
With the fire rainin' down and the hell all around
There were few men left standing that day
Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky
1965, the 8th of November

[Bridge]
Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky
1965, 65

[Chorus]
On the 8th of November the angels were cryin'
As they carried his brother away
With the fire rainin' down and the hell all around
There were few men left standing that day
On the 8th of November the angels were cryin'
As they carried his brothers away
With the fire rainin' down and the hell all around
There were few men left standing that day
Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky
1965, the 8th of November
The 8th of November (The 8th of November)

[Outro]
Said goodbye to his momma as he left South Dakota
To fight for the red, white and blue
He was nineteen and green with a new M-16
Just doing what he had to do
