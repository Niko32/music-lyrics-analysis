How bout we just sing forever?
Bring your hands, close together
Baby, ahhhhhh, baby, ahhooaaoaaaa
When you talk they call you liar
Sure don't know, join the choir
Baby, ahhhhhh, baby ahhooaaoaaaa
Silent movies make more money
So how 'bout we make more money, girl?
When you dance they call you funny
So how bout we get real funny, girl?
Say whoa whoa girl
