There was Adam
Happy as a man could be
Until Eve got him messing
With that old apple tree

[Chorus]
Isn't that just like a woman?[x3]
They'll do it every time

[Verse 2]
Lot took his wife
Down to the corner for a malted
She wouldn't mind her business
Boy, did she get salted

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Samson thought Delilah
Was on the square
Until one night
She clipped him all his hair

[Chorus]
You might also like[Verse 4]
From our history books
We all learned
Nero fiddled
While Rome was burned

[Chorus]

[Verse 5]
Marie Antoinette met
Some hungry cats at the gate
They was crying for bread
She said, "Let them eat cake"

[Chorus]

[Verse 6]
You can buy a woman clothes
And give her money on the side
No matter what you do
She isn't never satisfied

[Chorus]
