Listen up good, I got a lot to say
Well, I know what I want
And I get my own way
I call 'em as I see 'em
I don't play by the book, no I don't
One dose of volume, that's all it took

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I've seen it, I've done it, I've heard it before
Now it's my turn to settle the score
I'll sing it, I'll shout it, I'll say it again
I don't care if they never give in

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
You know I'm proud
Proud to be loud

[Verse 2]
Well, I've always believed in freedom of speech
And I've always been the one who practiced what I've preached
(Love it or leave it) I'll give you the choice
But it'll snow in hell before I lower my voice
Yes, it will
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
I live it, I breathe it, I gotta have more
It's full blast and this means war
The power, the glory, it's calling my name
I won't start to play their game

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
I'm proud to be loud, and I'll never turn it down again, no
Proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
I'm proud, proud to be loud
Proud

Proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
(Oh) No!

[Lead: Ferrari & Darrell]

[Chorus]
(No) Proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
I'm proud to be loud, and I'll never turn it down
Never, never, never turn it down
Proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
I'm proud
Proud to be to be loud
Turn it up!

[Refrain]
Proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
Proud to be loud

Proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
Proud to be loud
