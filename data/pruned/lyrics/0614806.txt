Come up and shake hands with:

HOVIE LISTER, organizer of the group, pianist and master of ceremonies. Hovie has realized his earliest ambitions—to sing and preach the gospel. An ordained minister, he manages to fulﬁll a strenuous touring schedule and always return home for Sunday services at the Mount Zion Baptist near Marietta, Georgia

DOY OTT, the Statesmen’s baritone and one of the foremost songwriters and accompanists in the world of gospel music. Doy, a native of McAlester, Oklahoma, is part Choctaw Indian

BIG (6'3") CHIEF WETHERINGTON, whose deep bass voice and wonderful personality attract crowds at every appearance

Jake Hess, whose great gospel singing is heard in most of the solo parts. Only his love for inspirational music has kept Jake from becoming one of the really great popular singers in the nation

C. G. "CAT" FREEMAN, tenor singing star, who hails from Fyffe, Alabama. “Cat” is one of the newest members of the quartet, but a real veteran none the less. He was with the Statesmen at the beginning and returned after the death of the late and beloved Denver Crumpler. He now lives in Atlanta, Georgia, as do all of the Statesmen

Despite the rigorous one-night stands, the Statesmen stay fresh and enthusiastic because of their own system of traveling. Some time ago they acquired a 37-passenger bus which they completely remodeled. The entire interior of the bus was removed; they installed modern “sleepers,” a wardrobe department which accommodates their many changes of clothes, a special make-up department, and other comforts of home

This bus, painted a bright gold with “Statesmen Quartet” lettered on its sides in black and silver, signals the arrival of the group when they come into your city or town
