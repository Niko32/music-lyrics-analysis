The interview was no surprise
And Bob telling lies
Wish I could remember where I met you
Trying to remember
So I can forget you
Changed my number 30 times
You called and got my number from the label 30 times
Milkshakes brought you to the lie
Must've got caught up because you felt so hard

[Pre-Chorus]
You wasn't cheating
Could've believed it
You wasn't even like that
Wasn't even trying
Boy, why you lying?
You wasn't even like that
All up on MySpace
Looking for my name
Hoping that I would just write back
If somebody said your name to me
Who?
Huh, no

[Chorus]
Boy, you wasn't that serious
It wasn't that serious
All up on the magazines
Blowing it up
All around your homies
Just throwing it up
Boy, you wasn't that serious
You wasn't that serious
You was just something to do
You was just something to do
You might also like[Verse 2]
You always talk amongst
The guys always fail to satisfy
Used my names in conversations
'Cause you ain't that interesting
Acting like we best of friends
No, you don't know where I live
Wishing it was something else
Boy, you know you need some help

[Pre-Chorus]
You wasn't cheating
Could've believed it
You wasn't even like that
Wasn't even trying
Boy, why you lying?
You wasn't even like that
All up on MySpace
Looking for my name
Hoping that I would just write back
If somebody said your name to me
Who?
Huh, no

[Chorus]
Boy, you wasn't that serious
It wasn't that serious
All up on the magazines
Blowing it up
All around your homies
Just throwing it up
Boy, you wasn't that serious
You wasn't that serious
You was just something to do
You was just something to do
[Chorus]
Boy, you wasn't that serious
It wasn't that serious
All up on the magazines
Blowing it up
All around your homies
Just throwing it up
Boy, you wasn't that serious
You wasn't that serious
You was just something to do
You was just something to do

[Outro]
Your new boyfriend is old news
Your new boyfriend is old news
Boy, you wasn't that serious
It wasn't that serious
