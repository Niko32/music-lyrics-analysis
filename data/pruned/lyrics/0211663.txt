My love lives out at the end of the road
Takes what you give her and goes
Says things that everyone knows
She's only willing to kiss me again
Lights me on fire, sprays me with water
And she lights me up again

[Verse 2]
Said my love buried my head in the sand
Screams just as loud as she can
Sings me to sleep when I can't
She's always willing to kiss me again
She wakes up the neighbors, goes down for water
And then she comes up again

[Verse 3]
I said good love lives on the radio dial
Never goes out of style
Makes all the children run wild
We keep on thinking, straight to the end
Know it completely
We just just shout for the moment, and then we vanish again

[Verse 4]
My love waits at the end of the road
Takes what you give her and goes
Says things that everyone knows
Yeah, she's my love, talking about my love
Ya she's my love, my love, my love
She's my loveYou might also like
