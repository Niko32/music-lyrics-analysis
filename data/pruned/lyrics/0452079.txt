Who do I know in Dallas?
Who can I call on the phone?
Who do I know in Dallas
Who'll make me forget she's gone?

[Verse]
I can't spend a night without someone
For the loneliness will drive me insane
Who do I know in Dallas
Who'll make me be glad I came?

[Verse]
It was Shirley consoled me in Phoenix
And Jeannie in old San Antone
But who do I know in Dallas
Who'll help me forget she's gone?

[Verse]
Oh, who do I know in Dallas?
Who can I call on the phone?
Who do I know in Dallas
Who'll make me forget she's gone?You might also like
