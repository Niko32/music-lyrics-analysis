I got something to say to you, hopefully these words right
I pray I don't

Crash and burn, cause baby all them curves tight
And if I do then oh well, step into my Hotel
You don't need no perfume I'm on
That shit you can't smell

[Hook: Teezy] x 2
You get too high just ride it out, you get too high just ride it out
You
Get too high just ride it out, just ride it out, just ride it out
You get too
High just ride it out, you get too high just ride it out
You get too high
Just ride it out, I love it when you ride it out, go

[Verse 2: Teezy]

Girl don't drink that too fast, don't forget this ain't wine
If you don't
Wanna sleep forever then I suggest you take your time
You say you wanna have some fun, you know that I'm down for that
I hope
You're into making movies cause this gone be the soundtrack
This gone be a long ride, just strapped on my safe belt
I proceed with
Caution, don't wanna feel how Yay felt
I can hear your heat beat, everything is moving slow
Then I hit that cruise
Control, suddenly you lose control

You get too high just ride it out, you get too high just ride it out
You get
Too high just ride it out, just ride it out, just ride it out
You get too
High just ride it out, you get too high just ride it out
You get too high
Just ride it out, I love it when you ride it out, go
