I run away from me
Cause I cannot stay in my shoes
They're not keeping me worm any more

Am I so weak, tell me am I so weak?
Cause I feel alone
Am I alone, tell me am I alone?
Cause I have no home

I run away from my troubles
I run away from me
Cause I cannot play in these shoes
They're not keeping me dry any more

Am I so weak, tell me am I so weak?
Cause I feel alone
Am I alone, tell me am I alone?
Cause I have no home

Am I so weak, tell me am I so weak?
Well, I'm freezing cold
Am I so weak, tell me am I so weak?
Cause I am my own

Am I so strong, tell me am I so strong?
Cause I am my ownYou might also like
