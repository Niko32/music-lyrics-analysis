Addicted to caffeine and bad poetry
And not saying the things that I mean
You’re always sort of mad at me
Because I’m late for everything
And my socks don’t match and my hair is messy
Well, I know what you’re saying before you do
That I’m not good enough for you

[Chorus]
I’m good enough for me and all the things that I want to be
It’s still alright to be down sometimes
‘Cause nobody is perfect and I know that you’re not worth it
It’s still alright to be down sometimes

Always nervous when I’m with you
Never sure what I should do with my body
So I don’t do anything
But chip the polish from my thumbs
And peel the label off the bottle I’m drinking from
Wishing you’d say something
Well, I know what you’re saying before you do
That I’m not good enough for you

[Chorus]
You might also likeI know what you’re saying before you do, aha
I know what you’re saying before you do

I’m good enough for me and all the things that I want to be
It’s still alright, alright
‘Cause nobody is perfect and I know that you’re not worth it
It’s still alright to be down sometimes
I’m good enough for me
I’m good enough for me

Always sort of out of key
