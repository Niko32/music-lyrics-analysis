I’ll play your games with your sex, with electric shocks
Learn to let myself loose and be the dummy in your snapshots
I’ll play your games learn to get on with your backward fans
Stick my body in the sun and help to get rid of the white tan

[Chorus]
And maybe then you wouldn’t get so sick of me
And maybe then you wouldn’t get so sick of me
And maybe then you wouldn’t get so sick of me
And maybe then you wouldn’t get so sick of me

[Verse 2]
I’ll play your games, mark the names with the blackest thoughts
If you’re building me up to be the target for your cheap shots
I’ll play your games keep a blind eye on the main chance
Strip my body of its skin and try to cancel out the white trash

[Chorus]
And maybe then you wouldn’t get so sick of me
And maybe then you wouldn’t get so sick of me
And maybe then you wouldn’t get so sick of me
And maybe then you wouldn’t get so sick of me

[Verse 3]
I’ll play your games if your aim is for the quick fix
Cos I know what you wanted and i know how you got it
I’ll play your games if you play out in the fast lane
Learn to jump into the road and hope to save a little lost face
You might also like[Chorus]
And maybe then you wouldn’t get so sick of me
And maybe then you wouldn’t get so sick of me
And maybe then you wouldn’t get so sick of me
And maybe then you wouldn’t get so sick of me
