Catch me hanging pictures up on Heaven's walls
Hit the ignore button whenever the devil calls
It's your life, you decide what to settle for
No matter ? straight up, would you be better off?

Fuck how you look in the eyes of the weak
Get on your knees and start tying your feet
So set and best
Don't second guess, that's when complication surfaces
Lately, like the only bitch shit I've been flirting with
That's how I learn, I don't really fuck with you other niggas
Guess I'm a soft thug to you other figures
I ain't moving way to bust a trigger
To busy keeping it real trill, what's the deal?
I'm devoted, emotions keep from knowing
Floating on the richter scale, I'm sick as hell, sick as sickle cell
Used to live behind your bars, yo who posted bail?
You rap like we best friends, but don't know me well
I guess we all living in hell
Whether you live in a home or you live in a cell
Cause either way it's hard
We all gotta put our face somewhere, man I pray to God
But forreal though...

I've been down for too long
Been down for too long, been down for too long yea

(Yea it's time to get up and get this shit cracking, make it happen
If you ain't know you know now...
Higher Learning)

[Verse 2]

Better believe
The devil wears stilettos and heels
Never get in their way, I let them heal
They damaged, they all dance for cameras
Dancing for dollars, so throw a few if you man enough
I made enough to respect what they doing
Respect their influence, they got it
And that's got a few dollars in their pocket
And for my niggas on the corners who got drugs to push
I feel you, this ain't as easy as it fucking looks
Music is my drugs and ? is my five-0
I gain some more haters like the higher I go
You haters really loving disguise
Behind the hate, you can see the love in their eyes (I love it)
Society is eying me, I blame it on the public
Blame it on you puppets with no soul, it's so cold
In this world I swear to God don't get it fucked up
I've been through hell and back
Like sellin' rap
That's all I know, that's all I do
So I flow about my life to you
(You have to keep it real as fucking possible
Trying to accomplish the impossible)
But forreal tho...
