Rated R-Tard
It's too hard for the streets
Boulevard Barred
Spit that Charizard
Pullin Cards
Like an ATM
SITH and Supreme
Silent Assassinators
They be them
Play the Key Players
In the mix
Of Fleet Flavors

The Weapon is Hardcore
With a Rhyme attachment
I cloned the CEO
And dropped a couple Klassiks
Droppin Gem-nastics
Kick Karate
I Bash Bricks
This game is like a Gangbang
Dealing with vast Pricks
Throwin shots
When I'm done
Yall will be growin crops
And sowin socks
Soakin Mops
Everything you throw blows
Go and Box
Got a whole Fleet of DJ's
That spin like Waves
You need Brush up on your Skills

Spill the Ink on the Line Spaces
Be cautious and Gracious
Before you face us
