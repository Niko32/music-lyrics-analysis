And my heart grows cold, too cold, so cold to see
And the old man waits at the door
And the child inside calls out there must be more
Let there be music, dancing, music
Flight of fancy, music and dancing with your heart
Let there be real life
Let there be real life
Let there be real emotion
Let there be real life let there be real...
Light, that light, dog gone, gone left your sight oh love
Them bright light, city lights, got'ya sitting pretty
What you gonna do tonight
When you burned out, beaten and torn
Let the child inside call out there must be more
Let there be music, dancing, music
Flight of fancy, music and dancing with your heart
Let there be real life
Let there be real life
Let there be real emotion
Let there be real life let there be real...
Why must this life be so insecure
Why must hide people hide behind close doors
I am gonna change it today
Gonna open the door and I'm on my way
Gonna change it (real life)
Gonna change it (real emotion)
See this girl she's on her way
She gonna open the doors starting today
Let there be music, dancing, music
Flight of fancy, music and dancing with your heart
Let there be real life
Let there be real life
Let there be real emotion
Let there be real life let there be real...You might also like
