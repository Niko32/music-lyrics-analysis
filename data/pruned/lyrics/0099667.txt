You know who is a man who cyaan take the botheration, you know
So-so-so, so let di door, it hits you (Hey)
A where di good Lord splits you
Brand new musical disc (Hey)

[Verse 1]
You say you love and yuh care
But yet yuh never deh near
You are always on the run, now tell me this
Why we can't spend no quality time
Kick back, undress and unwind
You always have something fi do
That simply means that love deh nuh true
'Cause only when yuh want a fuck
Me hear you shout I love you
Tell me where all the passion gone, all of the warmth
Now tell me where is all the tenderness
And there is something else
That's been bugging me for so long, tell me this

[Chorus]
Tell me if love so nice
Tell me why it hurt so bad (Ba-dang)
If love-love, so nice
Tell me, tell me why I'm sad (Mi sing again)
Tell me if love so nice
Tell me why it hurt so bad (Ba-dang)
If love-love, so nice
Tell me, tell me why I'm sad (Mi sing again, well)

Why if yuh nails fi do a mi
Bill fi pay a mi, hair fi do a mi
And yuh making fun a me
And I'm the only one with the J.O.B
So baby why don't yuh give me some TLC
And there is rumors going around
Say that when I'm outta town
There is a man where I'm supposed to be
Too late to be begging on your knees
Hand me my keys and leggo off mi shirt sleeve
You can go do as you please
You can go talk to John, Peter or Steve

[Chorus]
Tell me if love so nice
Tell me why it hurt so bad (Ba-dang)
If love-love, so nice
Tell me, tell me why I'm sad (Mi sing again)
Tell me if love so nice
Tell me why it hurt so bad (Ba-dang)
If love-love, so nice
Tell me, tell me why I'm sad (Mi sing again, well)

[Verse 3]
No man nuh want fi live a lonely life
Of that I'm sure
But mi nah go settle fi less
When I know I deserve more
Everyday from mi vessel
When mi love yuh come a pour
You come a pour it out
And when me ready fi some of yours
You lock me out change the route
And then you run your mouth
But you nuh know what love is about
Well I'm sick an I'm tired
I'm tired and I'm sick
And I don't want no more of this
[Chorus]
Tell me if love so nice
Tell me why it hurt so bad (Ba-dang)
If love-love, so nice
Tell me, tell me why I'm sad (Mi sing again)
Tell me if love so nice
Tell me why it hurt so bad (Ba-dang)
If love-love, so nice
Tell me, tell me why I'm sad (Mi sing again, well)
