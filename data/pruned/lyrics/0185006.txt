Smoked our last dime
Life has lost its shine
I'm not feeling fine

Once we loved
We traded it in
Got hooked on the drugs
Only brings sin

I'm the bastard
You the bitch
We married once
But its drugs we hitched

I want to tear up the world
Kick some fucking ass
But we did this together
Lets leave it in the past

We have run out of time
Smoked our last dime
Life has lost its shine
I'm not feeling fine

So leave me the fuck alone.......good-byeYou might also like
