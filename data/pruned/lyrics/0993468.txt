This right went wrong
Stop your cryin child
Diamonds and stones
My skin my bones
Stop your cryin child

'Cause the time has been and gone
Might as well just move along

The days go by
I just can't try
Stop your cryin child

Gave him my hips
Offered my lips
Stop your cryin' child

'Cause the time has been and gone
Might as well just move along

Fling a last word
I never learn
Stop your cryin' child

Water the flames
Wait for the train
Stop your cryin' child
You might also like'Cause the time has been and gone
Might as well just move along

'Cause the time has been and gone
Might as well just move along
