When he tries to get in your head?
It's a long, lonely night
When you tell him "no", and you tell him "go"
And he shows you pictures instead
It's a long, lonely fight

[Chorus]
Hey, hey, fighter
You can stay with me
Hey, hey, fighter
You can stay
Wooh, yeah, you can stay with me
Wooh, yeah, you can stay

When you let her in, thought she was a friend
And you find she's no friend at all
It's a hard, lonely time
And you let her see every little thing
In your heart, a clear crystal ball
It's a hard, lonely fight

[Chorus]

Got no one to keep you warm
You feel the fire is dyin'
You can lie here by my side
You might also like[Chorus]
