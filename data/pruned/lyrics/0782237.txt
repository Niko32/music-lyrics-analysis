Offer some protection
Curled up foetal in our beds
Naked we lay
Everybody says it but do they really mean it?
(You'll be fine you'll be fine)
Everybody waves it like a hand in my face
But what's surviving anyway?
Tell me that I'm safe, tell me that I'm safe
I need to hear it
Tell me that I'm safe, tell me that I'm safe
I need to hear it - all of the time
I need to hear it
Tell me that I'm safe, tell me once again
Crawl into the overhead, ready for the thunder
Dreaming of the riverbed on some better day
Everybody's saying that I'm doing really good now
(And how far I have come)
Everybody's happy just to stay in one place
'Cause what's surviving anyway?
Tell me that I'm safe, tell me that I'm safe
I need to hear it
Tell me that I'm safe, tell me that I'm safe
I need to hear it - all of the time
I need to hear it
Tell me that I'm safe, tell me once again
Close my eyes I'm just like a newborn child
A newborn child I tell you
When I close my eyes
I'm just like a newborn child, a newborn childYou might also like
