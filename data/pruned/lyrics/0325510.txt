Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages cleft for me

[Verse 1]
There's a family bible on the table
Each page is torn and hard to read
But the family bible on the table
Will ever be my key to memories
At the end of day when work was over
And when the evening meal was done
Dad would read to us from the family bible
And we'd count our many blessings one by one

[Chorus]
I can see us sitting around the table
When from the family bible dad would read
I can hear my mother softly singing
Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages cleft for me

[Verse 2]
This old world of ours is full of troubles
This old world would oh, so better be
If we had more bibles on the table
And mothers singing Rock of Ages cleft for me
