Hey Jesus white Inka
Kumba ya my lord kumba ya hey
Oh lord kumba ya

Go tell it on the mountains that you believe
It's the word of the only commander in chief
He's got the world in his hands just say yo
He gotcha by your balls swing it low chariot

I was a sinner a bad girl lord pardon me
I was deaf dump and blind but now I can see
I'm the Öko-Christ with my guitar
I say give it to me Jesus ha ha ha
