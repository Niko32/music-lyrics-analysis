Yo, aiyyo move to this shit, groove to this shit

LADIES~! If you're lovely, let's get down

I wanna meka-leckha-kai your thigh (Oooh I could just die!)
The way you're shakin makin me-a-wanna-cry

[Jamie Kennedy]
I hope you got eyes in the back of your head
Maybe you can make 'em see me to my bed
Tonight's the night (I'm in love at first sight)
