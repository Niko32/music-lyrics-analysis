Yeah it's going down, we ain't playin' with ya Three 6 Mafia
Yeah, we gettin' fucked up
We gettin' fucked up, we gettin' fucked up
We gettin' fucked up ,we gettin' fucked up
We gettin' fucked up, we gettin' fucked up
We gettin' fucked up, we gettin' fucked up
We gettin' fucked up, chicka-blicka-yaa

[Josey Scott]
Sometimes I feel I'm flying
Sometimes I feel like I'm dying
Maybe the world is against me
Maybe the world thinks I'm crazy
Sometimes I feel like I'm moving
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing
Maybe the world is against me
Maybe the world is a lie

[Chorus]
(Maybe the world is a lie)
We gettin' fucked up (x16)

[Verse 1: DJ Paul]
I'm wild as hell
Straight up out the hood I bail
I'm a crazy mother fucker but I do it well
Sometimes I can't even believe I'm still alive
Stayin' fly I can't drive 55
Like Hagar, I got a cigar rolled tight
I'm a stunt man sipping on syrup and Sprite
I got that act right medicine from my doc (What's up?)
Loritab ten milligrams that I pop yeah (What's up?)

Walk up in the club like a thug, get your ass kicked
Step off in the parking lot and leave in a casket
Acting like a scary coward giggling and laughing
Let me hit the Purple Kush
Hurry up and pass it
Yeah they call me Juicy J, a Three 6 Mafia bandit
Got to ride on 24's and something with a candy
Ounce of that green and a fifth of liquor brandy
A AK-47 on my lap I keep it handy

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:Project Pat]
I'm the wildest one
The wildest one
Mask on my face in my lap's a gun
In ya back seat bring heat to ya avenue
Dump on ya verse that's what Project Pat'll do
Riding in a hearse 'cause ya came with an attitude
Then it's disperse from the gauge that'll rattle you
Smoke so much trying to come with a cross move
To this lunatic house, hollow points when I toss you

[Josey Scott]
Sometimes I feel I'm flying
Sometimes I feel like I'm dying
Maybe the world is against me
Maybe the world thinks I'm crazy
Sometimes I feel like I'm moving
Sometimes I feel like I'm losing
Maybe the world is against me
Maybe the world is a lie
[Outro]
Maybe the world is a lie [x5]

We gettin' fucked up [x16]
