Who is the propitiation, the satisfaction, if you would
For our sins
And not just for our sins
But for the sins of the whole world
The blood of Jesus Christ flowed from seven places

The first place he bled from
The blood poured from his head that day
The blood from the thorns in his skull
Cleanse you from thoughts

The blood that was on his face
He has covered the things that you may not want to face up to
Because of what you've seen or heard
Know this
The blood flowed for you

Yeah, but, John
You just don't know
I've backed away from the Lord
I've turned my back on him
Well, they took a flagellum and they beat his back
And blood flowed from his back
It was reduced to hamburger meat that day
His back was beaten so brutally
And if you've turned your back on him and walked away from him
Know this
The blood, the blood that poured from his back cleanses you
Sprinkles you
You might also likeYeah, but, John
You just don't know
What I've done with these hands
Those hands were pierced
Those hands were pinned to the tree
Spikes driven through those hands
Where he bled to cleanse you
And cleanse me
From the stuff that we've handled that we'd ought not to have handled
The stuff that we've done that we ought not to have done
Hey, understand
The blood flowed from his hand

Yeah, but it's stuff that's inside of me, John
It's just things that I feel in my gut
I have bitterness towards them
And I'm angry with her
Jesus wants you to know
That blood flowed from his side when they thrust that spear into him
When he hung on the cross

Feet that walked where I'd not to have walked
Blood flowed from his feet too
Where the spike pinned him through the feet
To the cross of Calvary
And now I realize
Things that I can't face up to
Thoughts that I've had that are not right, not good, not true
Bitterness inside of me
Stuff I've touched that I ought not to have touched
Places I've gone where I ought not to have walked
And I look, and I realize
The seven-fold flowing of the blood of Christ
Cleanses me in every area, from all sin
And I'm free
And I'm forgiven
By the blood
What can wash away my sin
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
Seven times perfection
Seven places
That's what he went through
For me and for you
