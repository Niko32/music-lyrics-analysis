Shawty bad kinda like Michael Jackson
Shawty fine and she's always 'bout that action
I'm so fascinated, don't worry 'bout them girls, they hating
Do your thing, baby girl. But don't keep me waiting
Don't be wasting my time, got a whole lot of girls on my line
What's your name? What's your sign?
But don't you ever fall behind

And all we do is grind. Tell me what you wanna do?
What you wanna do when I come through?
I seen a lot of faces, shawty. Then I seen you
You ain't nothing like them other girls. You in a different atmosphere
Yeah, I seen it loud and clear. Go and tell them haters to get out of here
