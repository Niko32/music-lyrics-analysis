Do you believe, do you believe in the magic of love
I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe, do you believe in the magic of love

When there's no love in your life
Days feel long, you're all alone, and life waves you bye-bye
You close the door to your heart
Dont want to let the pain in yet, you're always on your guard
But when the love birds start to sing, you hear bells start to ring
And you feel its happening, oh baby

I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe, do you believe in the magic of love
I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe, do you believe in the magic of love

When there's no love in your home
You're on the street so incomplete, you're out on your own, oh
You'll meet some just along for the ride
But you know where they're coming from, let your conscience be your guide
But when the day comes, the night goes, when your hate stops your love flows
Stimulation in an overload, oh baby

I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe, do you believe in the magic of love
I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe, do you believe in the magic of love
You might also likeI can feel it in my heart
I feel the power of the hour, a sensation celebration
I can feel it, feel it in my soul, my soul
Feel the magic all around you, now that love has found your life

I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe, do you believe in the magic of love
I believe in the magic of love, baby
Do you believe, do you believe in the magic of love
