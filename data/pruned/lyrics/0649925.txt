Dirt, mud, and dust, bibles and beer
Outlaws, barbed wire, saddles, and steers
It's a simple life, on this sacred ground
Hard times, high winds can't bring us down

[Chorus]
In cowboy town
Yeah, cowboy town
That's where I'm from
Cowboy town

[Verse 2]
We wear our boots to dinner and drive our trucks to church
Solid as a rock, salt of the earth
We like our whiskey strong, play our music loud
We get things done by the sweat of our brow

[Chorus]
Here in cowboy town
Yeah, in cowboy town
That's where I'm from
Cowboy town

[Bridge]
Winners, losers, sinners, and saints
It's where a good man's word is money in the bank
Bad boys, pretty girls is the name of the game
When you hit the ground, get up, shake off the pain
That's a cowboy town
You might also like[Verse 3]
Someday when I die and my soul is called home
High on a white horse I'll ride up on it
That golden chute will stand old St. Pete
He'll tip his hat and welcome me

[Chorus]
To cowboy town
Aww, cowboy town
Son, come on in
To cowboy town

[Outro]
I'm gonna live and die
In cowboy town
