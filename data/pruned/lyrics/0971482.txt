Digging under the ground
Rain seems doubtful
There's a gray cloud in every town
You've been saying over and over
You said it over and over
You're down, you're down, you're down
Sun setting over and over
You said it over and over
You're done, you're done, you're done
Great big mountain
You want it your way. You move it slowly
Digging under the ground
Ground grooves sewed in, fault lines moldin'
You've been saying over and over
You said it over and over
You're done, you're done, you're done
Sun setting over and over
You said it over and over
You're down, you're down, you're down
Ooo oh, ooo oh eee
We'll move camp and lose the soldiers
Air is damp and growing cold
Light a lamp and give us orders
Now we lie in miner's gold
Great big mountain
Digging under the ground
Rain seems doubtful
There's a gray cloud in every town
You've been saying over and over
You said it over and over
You're down, you're down, you're down
Sun setting over and over
You said it over and over
You're done, you're done, you're done
Your gold city has come
You're done building arms
If you come and go
When you say soYou might also like
