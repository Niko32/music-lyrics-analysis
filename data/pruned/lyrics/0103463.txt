We can jet, believe it, I know that you want
And yes, there's a feeling we both need to know

[Refrain]
Let us start now, it's that time
So let's travel and see the life

[Pre-Chorus]
(And I'm) Gonna take you out anywhere you wanna go now
(Tell me you'll ride) To the town where we both can party now (Now, now, n-n-now)

[Chorus]
Drink in London, dance in Paris
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Shout real loud now and let them hear us
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Tonight, night, night, night, night, night, night
Tonight, night, night, night
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Tonight, night, night
Tonight, night, night

[Verse 2]
If it's evening, we'll party 'til morning
You might also like[Refrain]
Let us start now, it's that time
So let's travel and see the life
(I'll watch it shine, shine, shine, shine, sh-sh-shine)

[Chorus]
Drink in London, dance in Paris
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Shout real loud now and let them hear us
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Tonight, night, night, night, night, night, night
Tonight, night, night, night
Let's chase our love, let's chase our love
Tonight, night, night
Tonight, night, night
