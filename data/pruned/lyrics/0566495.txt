Or am I fool number two?
How many other girls have been fooled by you?
I suppose that the number is far from being small
And I'll bet that I'm the biggest fool of all
If I had the chance
I guess I'd do it all again

I'd go down that same old road
Even knowing
At the end you'd leave me
When your heart hears a new love call
So I guess that I'm the biggest fool of all

Am I fool number one
Or am I fool number two?
How many other girls have been fooled by you?
I suppose that the number is far from being small
And I guess that I'm the biggest fool of allYou might also like
