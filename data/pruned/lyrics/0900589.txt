'cos your the type of guy I thought I'd never find
I thought I could forget you and be strong
But the love I have inside makes me hold on

And now I am beside myself
I think of you and no one else
You held me tight I felt so safe
And now I know I've been replaced

What does she look like?
Why was she so right?
That you gave your love to her
Baby didn't I deserve
To hold you
Baby, to show you
That the love I have inside to give
Was enough for us to leave

You'll never know the hurt you put me through
Cos you're loving her while I was loving you
You took my heart and ripped it into shreads
And now your heart is with that girl in your bed

I know I'm just a memory
But I will love you endlessly
You cherished me
You made me strong
You gave me strength to carry on

Baby, didn't I deserve
To hold you
Baby, to show you
That the love I have inside to give
Was enough for us

Don't you think I'll sit there crying over you
Baby, don't you take me for a fool no, no, no
I'll think of you along the way
I'll get over you I hope and pray
If I was not the one for you
Why did you choose me? to make me blue?
