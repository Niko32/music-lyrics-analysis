Go son, go down to the water
And see the women weeping there
Then go up into the mountain
The men, they are all weeping too

[Verse 2: Nick Cave & Blixa Bargeld]
Father, why are all the women weeping?
They are all weeping for their men
Then why are all the men there weeping?
They are weeping back... at them

[Chorus: Nick Cave & Blixa Bargeld]
This is the weeping song
A song in which to weep
While all the men and women sleep
This is the weeping song
But I won't be weeping long

[Verse 3: Nick Cave & Blixa Bargeld]
Father, why are all the children weeping?
They are merely crying son
Oh, are they merely crying, father?
Yes, true weeping is yet... to come

[Chorus: Nick Cave & Blixa Bargeld]
This is a weeping song
A song in which to weep
While all the little children sleep
This is a weeping song
But I won't be weeping long
You might also like[Bridge: Nick Cave]
Oh father, tell me, are you weeping?
Your face seems it's wet to touch
Oh, then I'm so sorry, father
I never thought I'd hurt you so much

[Chorus: Nick Cave & Blixa Bargeld]
This is a weeping song
A song in which to weep
While we rock ourselves to sleep
This is a weeping song
But I won't be weeping long
No, I won't be weeping long
No, I won't be weeping long
No, I won't... be weeping long
