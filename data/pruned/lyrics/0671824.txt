There's a lonely cottage by the seaside
Where the water lilies strew the shore
It was there I passed my happy childhood
With a loved one that's gone before
Then give me back my dear old home
That old home by the sea
And I never will wander far away
From my home, my dear old cottage home
Oh-le-lay-ee, ee-e-e-e-ee
Ah-lee-oh-lay-ee, ee-e-e-e-e-ee
Many years have passed since there I wandered
But the old cot' ne'er has been forgot
And my heart in fancy oft returns
To that dear old familiar spot
Then give me back my dear old home
That old home by the sea
And I never will wander far away
From my home, my dear old cottage home
Oh-le-lay-ee, ee-e-e-e-ee
Ah-lee-oh-lay-ee, ee-e-e-e-e-ee
Yes, my heart is like a humming sea shell
That tells of its birth where e'er it roams
I will sing of my cottage by the seashore
Of my home, my dear old cottage home
Then give me back my dear old home
That old home by the sea
And I never will wander far away
From my home, my dear old cottage homeYou might also like
