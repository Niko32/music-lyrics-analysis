That I can not forget
Something 'bout your smile
Makes it hard for me to sleep at night
Something about me
Doesn't work like normally
Something about you
That can't hold on to

Am I waiting in vain?
Do I deserve this pain?
When will i see you again?

Why did you talk to me – that day
Why did you say those things – that day
Why did you come to me – then walk away
When there was something in the air
Something in the way I meet you that day

Still can feel the way you looked at me
And I wonder how you stole my heart completely
Something in the way you would hold my hand
That I believe that fate will bring you back to me again

Am I waiting in vain?
Do I deserve this pain?
When will i see you again?

Why did you say those things – that day
Why did you come to me – then walk away
When there was something, something in the air

A guy like you belongs to somebody else
A guy like you will never come back again

Do you think of me now
Do you ever wonder how
We can meet again, meet again?

Why did you talk to me – that day
Why did you say those things – that day
Why can I not forget that day
Why can I not find words to say
Why did you come to me – then walk away
When there was something in the air
Something in the way I met you that day…
