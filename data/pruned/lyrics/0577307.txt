All night, girl I've been wishing 'bout you
All night, that's right, girl I confess I'm your fool
Can I, fly like a jet to rescue
Alright, that's why, I wear this s on my suit
[Hook: Tony Williams]
Girl you've been dancing all night
[?] you're fine
And just wanna get off your feet
Wanna take it home baby
Promise I'll treat you real sweet
They call me Mr Safety
And I come with a guarantee
That you'll make it home safely

[Verse 2: Raheem DeVaughn]
DJ just said it's last call
And now the club lights are on
If you want be my night cap
Like a full length mink coat I'll keep your body warm
I parked right outside
If we were to ride, I'd be your seatbelt
See girl you're too fine to leave afloat
Let me be your love boat

[Verse 3: Stokley Williams]
Fast or slow, we can go
It don't matter, as long as you are comfortable
Sweet lady, you're driving me so crazy
When I dance and make love to your mind
Shelter your heart from thieves of all kinds
When I guide you from the seat to the shore
Make you feel complete and secure
You'll be safe with me

[Hook]
[Bridge: Tony Williams & Stokley Williams]
I came, here tonight
To come and save you
I'm at your rescue
I can see
Your'e in need of me
Mr safety
Come go with me

[Hook]
[Outro]
Just call me
I promise I'll treat you real sweet
Just call me Mr Safety
