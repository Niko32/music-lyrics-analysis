I grab your hand and you say “Wait”
I say “No girl, it’s way too late”
We’ve been playing games for weeks
Now I’m ready to play for keeps

[Chorus: Both]
Oh, tonight, we’re gonna set the world on fire
And I’m gonna set aside my pride
Not gonna be the one to say “Goodbye”
Neither am I
Oh, tonight

[Verse 1: Josh Abbott & Kacey Musgraves]
So go on, kiss me on the mouth
You know you want to and you should’ve done it by now
Girl, you don’t know how long I’ve tried
I've been fighting feelings deep inside

[Chorus: Both]
Oh, tonight, we’re gonna set the world on fire
And I’m gonna set aside my pride
Not gonna be the one to say “Goodbye”
Well, neither am I
But oh, tonight
You might also like[Bridge: Both]
So tell me what you want me to do
Oh, it’s too late baby, I’ve already fallen in love with you

[Chorus: Both]
Oh, tonight, we’re gonna set the world on fire
And I’m gonna set aside my pride
Not gonna be the one to say “Goodbye”
Well, neither am I
Oh, tonight, we’re gonna set the world on fire
And I’m gonna set aside my pride
Not gonna be the one to say “Goodbye”
Neither am I
Oh, tonight
