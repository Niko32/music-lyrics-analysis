Me and my wife settled down (yeah)
Now me and my wife we're parted (yeah)
Going to take another stroll down town

[Chorus]
Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

[Verse 2]
Sometime I live in the country babe (yeah)
Sometime I live down tow-own (yeah)
Sometime I take a great notion (yeah)
To jump in the river and drown

[Chorus]
Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in my dreams

[Verse 2]
Stop gambling and stop all the rambling (yeah)
Stop staying out late at night (yeah)
Go home to your wife and your family (yeah)
Sit down by the fireside bright
You might also like[Chorus]
Sing everybody
Irene goodnight, Irene goodnight
Goodnight Irene, Goodnight Irene
I'll see you in
