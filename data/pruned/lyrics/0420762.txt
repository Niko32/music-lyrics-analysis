I am the god of hell fire and I bring you

[Chorus]
Fire, I'll take you to burn
Fire, I'll take you to learn
I'll see you burn!

[Verse 1]
You fought hard and you saved and learned
But all of it's going to burn
And your mind, your tiny mind
You know you've really been so blind
Now's your time burn your mind
You're falling far too far behind
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, you going to burn!

[Chorus]
Fire, to destroy all you've done
Fire, to end all you've become
I'll feel you burn!

[Solo]

[Middle]
You've been living like a little girl
In the middle of your little world
And your mind, your tiny mind
You know you've really been so blind
Now's your time to burn your mind
You're falling far too far behind
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no
You might also like[Chorus]
Fire, I'll take you to burn
Fire, I'll take you to learn

[Break]
You're going to burn!
You're going to burn!
You're going to burn!
You're going to burn! Burn! Burn! Burn!

[Solo]

[Chorus]
Fire, I'll take you to burn
Fire, I'll take you to learn
Fire, to end all you've become
I'll watch you burn

[Outro]
I am the god of hellfire, ha ha ha ha ha!
