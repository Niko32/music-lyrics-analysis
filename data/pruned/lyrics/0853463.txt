Oh holy place
What a beautiful place
Like nothing I've ever seen before
Pure rivers flow
From your throne
Weary seas in perfect peace
And appearing
Before my eyes
I see your glory
Too glorious to describe
Oh God
You carried me through the fire
Now you lift me high
And joy over whelms my heart

[Chorus:]
Here in your holy place
Your presence surrounds me
I feel your embrace
Angels all around, and trumpet sound
Here in your arms I'll stay, and melt away
I've never seen such majesty beauty and grace
Oh holy place
Oh holy place

All the spender
Brighter than the sun
Clear as crystal
Where thy will is done
Miraculous wonder
Set me free
A secret place eternally
And I thanked
The holy one
For loving my soul
With all his might
I'm so in love
With you
For your love is pure, and it shall endure
I'll ride on your wings and soar

[Chorus:]
Here in your holy place
Your presence surrounds me
I feel your embrace
Angels all around, and trumpet sound
Here in your arms I'll stay, and melt away
I've never seen such majesty beauty and grace
Oh holy place
