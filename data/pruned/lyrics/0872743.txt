In my pajamas and my winter coat
And take from the house our darker thoughts
And take away the memory of loss
And if I drop them into the snow
Will we never find them anymore?

To see him
To see him happy
To see him
To see him happy

In the same field where we have stood
To see your brother fly away in spring
In a light blue and silver plane
Now the snow has covered everything
I think we will be made clean like the snow
I think we will become new like the snow

To see him
To see him happy
To see him
To see him happy

Some winters are harder than others
We are going to take our cameras
And look through at black trees with empty arms
And sled tracks wandering as we are

To see him happy
To see him
To see him happy
