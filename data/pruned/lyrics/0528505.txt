There lies a tavern near Wisconsin Way
Where you can get drunk any time o' the day
The landlord's a bastard, the barmaid's a whore
But give them no shit or you're straight out the door

[Pre-Chorus]
The Sunk'n Norwegian's the name of this hole
A nasty ol' tavern if ever I known

[Chorus]
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink! Before we have to die
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky

One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink! Before we have to die
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky

[Verse 2]
Scoundrels and brigands and ne'er-do-wells
And creatures dragged up from the black pits of Hell
You'll find your relief in a tankard of ale
So the Sunk'n Norwegian is where we will sail
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
For barrels of whiskey or pints from the bar
But if you don't know
Then you don't go

One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink! Before we have to die
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky

One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink! Before we have to die
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky

[Bridge]
Drink up my friends, as much as you can
For tomorrow we sail! To a faraway land
We'll party all night and get drunk off our heads
Cause we can all rest when we are dead!

One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink! Before we have to die
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
One more drink! Before we have to die
One more drink! At the Sunk'n Norwegian
Raise up your tankards of ale to the sky
