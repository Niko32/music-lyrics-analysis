Lose your fucking mind
Un, deux, trois, quatre
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light)
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light)

[Verse 1]
I can't see you, babe, I feel you
Lost in this place 'til I found you
Playing hard to get, I-I-I know this game
Turning me on, switch it off again
One moment you're gone, the next you are here
Like smoke in my arms, you just disappear (C'mon)
One moment you're here, then you flash away
You're stu-stuttering, I-I-I want you to stay

[Chorus]
Strobelight, drop in your arms
Like a strobelight, so right, you're doing me wrong
And if I can get you for a second, all the sexing you'd be getting
Like a strobelight, drop in your arms
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light)
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light)

[Verse 2]
Is this a dream? Are you really there?
A trick of the eye, I-I, I saw you, I swear (Yeah)
One touch not enough, wanna dance with you all night
But you keep me in the, keep me in the half-life
You're running again, but losing the race
Is it love that you want? Or just the thrill of the chase?
One moment you're here, then you flash away
You're stu-stuttering, I-I-I want you to stay
You might also like[Chorus]
Strobelight, drop in your arms
Like a strobelight, so right, you're doing me wrong
And if I can get you for a second, all the sexing you'd be getting
Like a strobelight, drop in your arms
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light)
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light)

[Bridge]
If the lights were on, I'd hold your body
If we get them on we'd, get thing started
Would you take it off and, oh? Would you take it off and, oh?
I just want to turn you on, take it off
Like a strobelight
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Like a strobelight
Put your hands up, put your hands up, put your hands up

[Chorus]
Strobelight, drop in your arms (Let's go)
Like a strobelight, so right, you're doing me wrong
And if I can get you for a second, all the sexing you'd be getting
Like a strobelight, drop in your arms (Let's go)
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light) (Let's go, let's go, let's go)
Like a strobelight (Light, light, light, light, light) (Put your hands up)
