Hand me my guitar there's a song that I've been singing
When I was young I had a hell of the time
Looking for love in the misty waters
Of the seas that roll in a young girl's mind
Only in shadows and lonly at night
She turns to you softly you turn on the light
You use her abuse her and you know it ain't right
To treat one who loves you so badly
When she's doing the best that she can
You know she's doing the best that she can
Do you believe in dreams do you believe in dreamers
Hoping that you'll find what you're looking for
You don't have to worry there's a bright tomorrow
In the dreams that roll in a young girl's mind
Only in shadows and lonely at night
So hand me my guitar
In the seas that roll in a young girl's mindYou might also like
