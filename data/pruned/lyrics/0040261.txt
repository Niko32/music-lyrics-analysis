Please don't leave Rio
I wanna hear everybody in my ghetto say
Please don't leave Rio
But they trying so hard not to let me play
Please don't leave Rio
I wanna hear everybody in my ghetto say
Oh don't you go oh no Rio
Then I gotta let know how I feel !

Please don't leave Rio
Cause I ain't nothing but a dude from the G-yo
That's trying to play it cool on these dummies like the reapo
This rap game is mines let me show you how a G-flow
Chi town brothers show love for this
But the others want us down from above the bliss
But Imma drink Imma clown like a thug with crist
While I'm chillen downtown trying to plug my grips they say
(Please don't leave Rio)
Cause they know I represent this game
So when it all comes to life I resent the fame
And all the dollars and the price and the cents that came
I ain't nothing but a product trying to make it real
But they make it so hard for me to take this deal
(You gotta change your style) just to scrape my bills
I think this game is foul but lets embrace my skill by saying

I wanna hear everybody in my ghetto say
Please don't leave Rio
But they trying so hard not to let me play
Please don't leave Rio
I wanna hear everybody in my ghetto say
Oh don't you go oh no Rio
Then I gotta let know what's the real

The good and the bad is the hood that we had
But I came out good, so should I be sad ?
Money don't makes a one to succeed
Hey I come from the slums where I couldn't even read
I couldn't even spell but you would have never tell
I engraved myself from being dead or in jail
And raised myself and took it straight to this level
I forever will excel but I'll never leave this ghetto say'

Please don't leave Rio
I wanna hear everybody in my ghetto say
Please don't leave Rio
But they trying so hard not to let me play
Please don't leave Rio
I wanna hear everybody in my ghetto say
Oh don't you go oh no Rio
Then I gotta let know how I feel !
The life that I haul was a hard one to catch
I was treated like a dog but I played with the fetch
And gave my all but felt proud when I gave it
I'm having a ball but thanking god that I made it yeah
This is the cause because they owed my block
And I come a long way from when I sold the rocks
From under the stars getting paid and you told the cops (Heeey)
But look at what it made, you should have known my plot
I gotta song that's hot and a whole fam to feed
Looking for a company of a jam in need
And I ain't really gotta problem just a man indeed
Hoping that the ghetto understand my plead
I'll never let go another star is born
From the ill's of the hood to an even harder storm
And Imma preach to the kids
Like a father form Rio may be the ghetto
But he's far from norm now say

Please don't leave Rio
I wanna hear everybody in my ghetto say
Please don't leave Rio
But they trying so hard not to let me play
Please don't leave Rio
I wanna hear everybody in my ghetto say
Oh don't you go oh no Rio
Then I gotta let know what's the deal!
