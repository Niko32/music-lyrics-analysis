I first heard this song in Irvine

You told me I was good luck
I’m seventeen in Kilmarnock
I’m never going to be that again

Now I’ve seen what it means to win
Queen of Scots to the Arms of Eglinton

You wished me good luck
I caught the sleeper from Kilmarnock
I’m never going back againYou might also like
