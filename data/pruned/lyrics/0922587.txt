Tell me 'bout the price of time

Ever felt like wishing back one moment
One special second of your life
Ever felt like you'd do anything
You'd die - you'd scream - you'd pay for your life

Tell me 'bout the price of time - just believe
If I could turn the hands of time - just believe

Ever felt like you didn't act the way - (the way that you should)
Just like the way you wanted to - (that you wanted to)
Ever given a smile instead of a scream - (of a scream)
Instead of shouting and crying out loud - crying out loud

Tell me 'bout the price of time - just believe
If I could turn the hands of time - just believe

And the clock keeps ticking and the clock keeps ticking

Tell me 'bout the price of time - make it real
If I could turn the hands of time - just believe

If I could turn the hands of time - just believe
Just believeYou might also like
