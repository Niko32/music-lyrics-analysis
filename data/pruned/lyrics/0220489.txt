There are teddy bears and high school rings
And old photographs that mamas bring
That daddies with their young boys, playing ball
There's combat boots that he used to wear
When he was sent over there
There's 50,000 names carved in the wall

[Verse 2]
There's cigarettes, and there's cans of beer
And notes that say I miss you dear
And children who don't say anything at all
There's purple hearts and packs of gum
Fatherless daughters and fatherless sons
And there's 50,000 names carved in the wall

[Chorus]
They come from all across this land
In pickup trucks and mini vans
Searching for a boy from long ago
They scan the wall and find his name
The teardrops fall like pouring rain
And silently they leave a gift and go

[Verse 3]
There's stars of David and rosary beads
And crucifixion figurines
And flowers of all colors large and small
There's a Boy Scout badge and a merit pin
Little American flags waving in the wind
And there's 50,000 names carved in the wall
There's 50,000 names carved in the wallYou might also like
