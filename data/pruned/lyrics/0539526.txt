I just wanna smoke this weed, stare at the ceiling
Life might have a new meaning
You can keep your alcohol
Join in or I'll smoke alone
Lie with me, stare at the ceiling
What is this feeling?
It don't come from alcohol

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't had sex for a minute
Feels like sex when I hit it, oh
Ain't had sex for a minute
Feels like sex when I hit it, oh

[Chorus]
It feels like making love
Feels like making love
It feels like making love
Feels like making love

[Verse 2]
I am so lean, where is the ceiling?
Tell me that you're sharing this feeling
There is just no pain at all
Everything feels comfortable
There's no stress, everything's cool now
Nothing to lose now
I don't think I'll ever fall
Even if I have before
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't had sex for a minute
Feels like sex when I hit it, oh
Ain't had sex for a minute
Feels like sex when I hit it, oh

[Chorus]
It feels like making love
Feels like making love
It feels like making love
Feels like making love

[Bridge]
I don't need no stress
Let's not make this deep
I just need a friend
Come and fly with me
I don't need no stress
Let's not make this deep
I just need a friend
Come and fly with me

[Chorus]
It feels like making love
Feels like making love
It feels like making love
Feels like making love
