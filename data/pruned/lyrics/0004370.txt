In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

[Ray Yung]
Now picture this just a rapper tryna' get it in
If he 'ain't got a pen 'n pad, he's got it in his head
You catch him doodling at night, because this music is my life
And through this mic I shed the light until my studio is bright
But still life is dim
'Cuz I'm still living bent
And my skills with the pen 'ain't paying bills or the rent
But that number one spot
I'm coming, I promise not to stop
'Cuz I can't sit and watch while the wrong nigga got the spot
I remember everything, broke, living poor
Lock myself in my room and write until my wrist is sore
Always bickering with the LORD like what the fuck am I living for?
'Cuz the genie couldn't give me what the fuck I'm wishing for
Like cleaning up the hood and getting my family out today
I could really you use a wish, I need some candles on that cake
'Ain't got shit to smile about, so get them cameras out my face
Fuck with an MC, and them Hammers come out to play
Coming in the game 19, like Biggie did
'Tryna be Diddy Big in the lab, no guinea pig
All these other niggas on that swag and pretty shit
Now rap 'ain't working, but I'm rap's main circuit
I put in my work, man I should be balling in this game
Drop bombs on every song, Pearl Harboring everything
I made that wish with all my heart, and it never came
Now I'm starting to believe that shooting star was just a plane

In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
