Spent the last twenty years living in disguise
Hiding my identity from all the prying eyes
Trying to make a life of fabricated lies

I was only seven when my family was deceased
Just a skinny bugger, but the crowd wants a feast
They all took a bite, there's nothing left at least
That's how it seems to the brides of the beast

The sudden thud, the spurt of blood
The sound of crunching bone
Bring me your blood tonight at ten [2x]
I'm falling in love with myself again

Said I was responsible for other people's lives
Said that I was lethal with guns and clubs and knives
But I knew they belonged to me
Each one was my bride
None of them went quietly, each one gave his cryYou might also like
