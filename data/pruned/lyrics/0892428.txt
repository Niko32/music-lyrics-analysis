The tears I drink that taste like wine
The frozen stars that cover the silence
Where the ash bleeds that I behold

Through the sapphire nebula veil
Pain nails me on the heart
Thine sleeping calamity lies on
My marbled breast, covered like with leaves

Mediterranean tears on my scarful face
I bleed through thine astralized
Dimension of pain

Thou art drowning marbled charon
I sip thine scarlet weeping tearsYou might also like
