It's never been the same
Since you returned from dreamin'
With your nursery rhyme excuses
Your picture postcards gleamin'

[Verse 2]
Tellin' everyone who looks your way
'Bout people and their sinnin'
While you left field verse is fallin'
In proportion to your winnin'

[Chorus 1]
And I can't be your hero today
I'm through with the simple games you play
It just may take some time for me to even up the score
But I can't be your soldier home from war

[Verse 3]
And there you sit shoutin'
That there's still hope for us
While nature holds the handcuffs
On a Capricorn and Taurus

[Verse 4]
There's nothing you can do or say
To get me to your camp
Go fill up all your savings books
And buy yourself a lamp
You might also like[Chorus 2]
And I can't be your hero today
Your wholesale price is much to high to pay
A bargain basement atmosphere is no way to sell love
And I can't be your Superman above

[Chorus 3]
No, I can't be your hero today
That is all I really want to say
Go find a leading man who wants to play
I can't be your hero today
