I've seen a-many bridges in my time and crossed every one of them
With no trouble at all (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
I had trials and tribulations, heartaches and pains (Well, that's alright)
Survived them all, baby (Uh-huh, say it, say it!)
Hmph, I'm still Melody, and I'm still Cool
Melody Cool

[Verse 1]
They call me Melody Cool (Melody, Melody)
I was here long before you (Melody, Melody)
If you're good, I will love you (Melody) but I'm nobody's fool (Melody)
I'm Melody Cool

[Verse 2]
When I was born, there were tidal waves (Melody, Melody)
Whole town went under, nobody saved (Melody, Melody)
At every funeral, it rained every time I sang
Melody Cool
I have been here much longer (Melody), longer than you (Melody)
I'm Melody Cool

[Bridge]
Well, now, everybody running 'round talking 'bout saving souls
When they know good and plenty well, they got enough trouble
Trying to save their own
(Alright, say it, say it, girl)
(Melody...melody...melody)

Go on, go on
Every woman and every man (Melody)
One day, they just got to understand (Melody)
That if we play in the same key, everything will be
Melody Cool

[Breakdown]
(Melody, Melody, Melody, Melody)
What's your name? (Melody, Melody)
New power, wave your hand, everybody, sing out across the land
Say hey-hey-hey (Hey-hey-hey)
Say hey-hey-hey (Hey-hey-hey)
Everybody, say hey-hey-hey (Hey-hey-hey)
They call me Melody Cool (Melody, Melody, Melody)

[Outro]
Look here, young'un
Let me give you a piece of good advice (Melody)
And I do get paid for counseling
It ain't no big I's and little U's in my life
So that's why you see, they call me Melody Cool (Melody, Melody Cool, Melody)
I was here long before you (Melody, long before you)
If you're good (Melody)
I will love you but I'm nobody's fool (Melody)
I'm Melody Cool
(Melody, Melody Cool, Melody... long before you)
