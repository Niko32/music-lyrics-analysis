Or hanging out in the corner of my mind
Stringing up the gallow
Waiting on me to cross that line
That man's dangerous as hell, a threat to himself
If he got out there'd be hell to pay
And that's why my dark side don't ever see the light of day

I slowed down on the whiskey
Cause there always came a point
When I'd have one too many
Tear down every wall in that joint
I got a wife and got a son
That don't know half the stuff I've done
And I pray that's the way it stays
And that's why my dark side don't ever see the light of day
You can blame it on my rebel raisin', blame it on the south
You can blame it on the words I try to keep here in my mouth
It takes a lot to start me up but once that hammer drops
You don't want to be the one that tries to make me stop
All you thugs and ugly mugs dealing drugs and making noise
You can kill each other all you want
But if you touch my little boy
You begging for this bullet will be the last thing that you say
Before I let my dark side, ha ha, come out to playYou might also like
