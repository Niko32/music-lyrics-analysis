I've cried so much lately
That I've made out of list
The things to remember
Things to forget
But my mind can't separate
Joy from regret
I always remember the things
To forget

[Chorus 1]
Things to remember
With the day that we met
The day that we parted
Things to forget

[Chorus 2]
Well, why won't my heart
Let me do it this way?
With just things to remember
Today

[Chorus 1]
