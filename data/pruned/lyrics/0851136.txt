I don't want nobody else
If I can't be your lady
I'll just be alone all by myself
I can't fall for another
While you're on my mind
You're the kind of Baby
I've been hoping to find
If I can't have you Baby
Don't want nobody else
I don't want nobody else
No, no, I don't want nobody else

If I can't see you Cutie
I would rather to go blind
If I can't gaze upon your face
Go on and take my eyes
Don't want to look at nothing
If I can't see you
Not the sea, the mountains
Or the skies of blue
If I can't see you Cutie
I would rather to go blind
I would rather to go blind

I ain't much good without you
Babe, it's plain to see
I was made for you
And you were made for me
Maybe you should marry me
And make me your wife
I could make you happy
For the rest of your life
You might also likeIf I can't kiss you Honey
Don't want to keep these idle lips
I won't be grinning when you're funny
Or drinking no whisky sips
Your kiss is sweet as whispers
From a gentle breeze
Tingles me all over
Makes me weak in my knees
If I can't kiss you Honey
Don't want to keep my idle lips
Oh no, don't want to keep my idle lips

If I can't hold you Lover
I'll have to give my arms away
They feel strange on another
And never have a tendency to stray
Oh you feel so strong
And you feel so fine
I'd like to hold you Lover
'Til the end of time
If I can't hold you Lover
I'll have to give my arms away
I'll have to give my arms away

If I can't have you Baby
I don't want nobody else
