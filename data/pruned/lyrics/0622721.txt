When she met him they were teenagers
He was no more than seventeen
She was a little less than all that
But he held the bit between her teeth
He was tall and strong and lanky
The fear of Jesus was on her side
He asked her if she weren't too busy
Might come out for a ride

[Chorus]
She'll ride him until he's dead
Or rises to the occasion

They ran off the great embankment
They flew through the air so far
They landed with a mighty crash
Then got crushed by the falling star

[Chorus]

That small crossroads became a city
She was the bell of every ball
Boys would line up to try to ring her
She's let them line up down her hall
She ran up a life so lavish
Somehow those bills would all get paid
Your daddy worked and never faltered
Never forgot the things she said
You might also like[Chorus]

Times change but I still see
Her disapproval pouring out
She said I ain't got the gumption to make it
And you ain't scary enough to turn me around
But I'm hoping you might be game
To ride my dream aground
We'll ride it until it's dead
Or makes your mama proud

[Chorus]
