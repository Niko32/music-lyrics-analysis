We took it all apart, but I'm wishing I'd stayed
In the back room, something I heard you say

[Refrain]
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?

[Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back
We'll be coming back for you one day
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
You could see it from afar, we were riding that wave
Blinded by the lights, and it's something I crave

[Refrain]
We didn't want to call it too early
Now it seems a world away, but I miss that day
Are we ever gonna feel the same?
You might also like[Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day

[Bridge]
Gonna rise, gonna fall, getting pulled apart
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts
Gonna light up the skies, so ignore the stars
And we all do it all 'cause it stole our hearts

[Chorus]
Standing in the light 'til it's over, out of our minds
Someone had to draw a line
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
I don't even care if I know ya, out of our minds
Sad to leave it all behind
We'll be coming back for you one day
We'll be coming back for you one day
