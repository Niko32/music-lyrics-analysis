And I'm a theif
If the world should crumble down around you
Follow me

We stand alone
In a fallen world, without shelter
We stand alone
While your tears are falling
I have fallen, now

I surrender to everything
The past is time, that you have broken
(You have broken me)

I am alone and theres nothing
That will ever change me
I am alone. It's you I follow
And now I'm fallen

I've been waiting for along time
(I've been waiting for a while)
I've been waiting all alone
(I've been waiting)

Looking for excuses to hold on
Yeah, I'll drain you dry
Fighting for your life

I count my dreams on one hand
I hold the past in the other
This fight is never over-whelming me
A place to fall

I've been waiting for along time
(I've been waiting for a while)
I've been waiting all alone
(I've been waiting)

Looking for excuses to hold on
Yeah, I'll drain you dry
Fighting for your life

Fighting for my life
Woah yeah!
