Lying dormant devoid of sin
Skin is crawling
I feel the urge
Left defenceless
Nowhere to turn

I am the void
I am the way
It's calling
I am the void
I am the way
The way out from under here

Her transmission burns
Always

Divine I'm here within
Seeking solace from where I've been
Earth is moving
I'm standing firm
Here inside you
Nowhere to turn

I am the void
That's left astray
It's calling you
I am the hope that's blown away
Ignited and blown away

Ignited and blown away
Her transmission burns
Always
Her transmission burns
Her transmission burns

"Did you hear it? It shows you things, horrible things - the dark inside me, from the other place. I won't go back there, I won't"
"Did you hear it?"
"I won't go back there, I won't"

Her transmission burns
Always
