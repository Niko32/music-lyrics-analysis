It's pitiless, it's vivid in the sky (in the sky)
The sun glows out and on
It's merciless, even when you're up this high (in the sky)

(And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and)
And you really think you've got my number

Just don't forget
I know who you are
I know what you want
Maybe just a little somna

A woman has lived in my head, these past thirty years
Talks in a voice no one can hear (in the sky)
With her shoulders of fortune, and her waist of time
Soothe your body, change your mind
You've got to leave that world behind

(And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and)
And you really think you've got my number

Just don't forget
I know who you are
I know what you want
Maybe just a little somna
You might also like(In the sky)

Just don't forget
Just don't forget (in the sky)

Just don't forget
I know who you are
I know what you want
Maybe just a little somna

Just don't forget
I know who you are
I know what you want
Maybe just a little somna (in the sky)

Just don't forget
I know who you are
I know what you want
Maybe just a little somna (in the sky)
