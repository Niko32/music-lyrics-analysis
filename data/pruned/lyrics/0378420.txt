I've been searching for freedom
I've been looking for someone
In the dreams of my heart, I see your face
Calling me into the light
You're the vision of beauty
You're so radiant and lovely
I just cannot believe you're here with me
Your touch is my ectasy - my love
Looking into the future
We can see the beginning
Children living in peace and harmony
That is the way it will beYou might also like
