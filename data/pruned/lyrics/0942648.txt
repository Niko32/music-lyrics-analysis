I'll walk out this Kingdom not as a duty but an honor
Now called a son, I've been set free from the slavery of sin
And when I fall, I stand in the face of darkness and I say:
This is who I am
My father has freed my past, present, and future
He doesn't see what I see, He doesn't see what you see
He sees my destiny and calls me to be a son
This is who I am, in the midst of a firefight; You've called me a son
This is who I am, by the power of the risen death and what You have done
This is who I am, all I've been and who I've become
This is who I am, who I am: I'm a son!You might also like
