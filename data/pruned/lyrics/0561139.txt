Analyze my own matter from above
Blacked out eyes in an existence overgrown
Never fall back down, trapped in myself

Sold my hands, envy them
Can't find the one
I slowly start to cut pieces of flesh from my body
Dig in and dissect
Collecting examples of what the outside world sees
Under it all
I know the devastation I have caused

Upon myself and this world
Upon myself and this world
Upon myself and this world
Upon myself

Speak to me freely, I am listening
