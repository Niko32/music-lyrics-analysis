Amazing grace how sweet the sound
I heard that every single week
'Til I left my savior
To see if art could save a wretch like me

[Verse 2]
So far it's working out fine
I've gained a gaping hole inside my chest
And all my demons they moved in with me
They never fill me up but they sure try their best

[Verse 3]
It's strange I've made my home here
I've shared a table with holy men
Like a stray dog for dinner
I eat my fill just to leave empty again

[Verse 4]
Now the sadness is setting in
I left your kingdom just to live in weeds
Wasn't searching for darkness
Just what you promised in your gospel of peace
But God I'd settle for one night of sleep

[Outro]
What's that about grace that burns me up?
Unfailing love is not quite enough
I've heard your whisper, now where's my touch
You promised me
Oh father heavenlyYou might also like
