(I know you would) you know I'd move it for you
See the color of my hair I changed it for you
(Mhm you do that for me) you know I changed it for you

Baby it's true love and we've never had this feeling
It's true love and I can't believe it's real
No more broken hearts for you girl I feel the same way too
'Cause it's true love brand new love with you

See that star up in the sky I'll go get it for you
(Oh honey I know that) you know I'll get it for you
See these tears in my eyes hear me cry
(Hey did I do something wrong) no I'm so happy inside

Baby it's true love it's a different natural feeling
It's true love and this time I know it's real
No more broken hearts for you girl I feel the same way too
'Cause baby it's true love and I've never had this feeling

It's true love and I can't believe it's real
No more broken hearts for you girl I feel the same way too
'Cause it's true love it's a simple natural feeling
It's true love and I can't believe it's real
It's true love it's a super natural feeling
It's true love and I can't believe it's realYou might also like
