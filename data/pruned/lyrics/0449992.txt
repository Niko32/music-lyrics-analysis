I pinch myself
Sometimes to make sure I'm not in a dream
That's how it seems
I close my eyes
And breathe in the sweetest moments I've ever known
It feels like home

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And here I am
I want to be your everything
There you are
Turning winter into spring

[Chorus]
And everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're a standing ovation
After years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing, yeah
I just call you mine

[Verse 2]
I fall apart
And just a word from you somehow seems to fix
Whatever's wrong, oh
You reach into the weakest moments
And remind me that I'm strong
You got to know
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'd be a fool
Not to see, or even worse, to forget
That you're more than I deserve

[Chorus]
'Cause everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're a standing ovation
After years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
I just call you mine

[Bridge]
Nothing makes sense when you're not here
As if my whole world disappears
Without you what's the point of it

[Chorus 2]
'Cause everyone that sees you
Always wants to know you
And everyone that knows you
Always has a smile
You're the dream that I've been chasing
After years of waiting
For a chance to finally shine
Everyone calls you amazing
I just call you mine
Everyone calls you amazing, yeah
I just call you
Mine
