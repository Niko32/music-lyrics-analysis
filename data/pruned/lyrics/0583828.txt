Are thou so blind
In what you view
That which your mind
Is misconstrued
Is this reward what you consider
An award? Have you once figured?
Are you aware of your affairs
In which your paired
Reflects your prayer?
I combust into a storm
Silly savages in qualms!
Your just atoms, which collided
Feeble matter, in this form
Are you a doubter?
Say it loud
Has your position
Made you proud?
This, a wrath which I capture
A math for the trapped
As I shatter with a force
Every soul shall collapse
'Eni mini miny fist
Of teeny tiny whiney wits'
This life is only temporary
Death is when your time begins
Are thou in such a status which
Allows you to increase the pitch
So boggled are your thoughts
You've been caught up by your weaknesses
Bias! what you speak
What's your source for your street?
There's a science to this scripture
Calculated if you seek
There's alliance in your heart
With thy Creator don't you see?

This is revelation, for this rebel nation
This is revelation, for this devil nation

[Verse 2: Sullee J]

Such is that the truth which you done shown has not a proof!
And what you scream of your belief
Is out of reach
Deceit!
Nah, Sullee's not afraid
Of no Isis or Al-Qaeda
I'm the tiger that'll rise above
The wisest of your fighter's
You portray not my religion
You have fallen in desire
This deception of shaitaan
Has mislead you toward the fire
Pay heed to what I've spoken
Angels descend! Motion!
Wind against the oceans
The turbulence cause commotion
Islam is not a threat
Nor' is Jihad what you suspect
All the news they got you watching
Is a plan of their's direct
All of this is tyranny, blasphemy
Casualties!
Pyramid strategies
I dare you to battle me
Every verse inverts the universe
My syllables is power!
I'm parallel to nothin'
All you pharaoh's get devoured

[Verse 3: Sullee J]

I'm quicker than the jinn
That brought the throne of bilqis
To king solomon's seat
I foreshadow when i speak
This is wisdom for the hearts
Admonition for the weak
I'm the vision in the dark
Ammunition for the sleep
It's a, clear sign for humanity you see
It's a, clear sign for the animals agree?
I even taddled with them flames
Jinns traveling a free

'Wa Mā 'Adrāka Mā Aţ-Ţāriq'

Escalate ignorance, then regulate the sheep
May the eyes of you cowards never sleep
Racism's alive, it's empowered in their speech
All illness got a cure, there's just power in the fee
All fiends got a motive, all pills do not relieve
What they tell you on tv, you probably should not believe
'Thumma innahum lasaalul jahim'
