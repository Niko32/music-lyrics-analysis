Headed way back east
Left behind some pain
In hopes of finding some peace
Fortunately caught one
Bound for my old neighborhood
Either way, between us, it's good

They're building a bridge
Links Manhattan with the heartland
It's called the California ridge
The country needs to expand
Saw them lay the first stone
It was made of wood
Either way, between us, it's good

In an age of greys
When wrong won't become right
Let's lift the haze
And scale the heights

Set my shoulders straight
Took a deep breath
This meeting I anticipate
Unlike impending death
Strode on to the platform
And there you stood
At worst, between us, it's goodYou might also like
