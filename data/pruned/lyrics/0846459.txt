The big balloons
Are all around
And you can hear
The happy sounds
The music's right
It's right for you
And everyone
Is singing to you

[Chorus]
Today, today is your birthday
Another birthday, another year
Today, today is your birthday
Another birthday, another year
Your birthday is here

Blow them out

Today, today is your birthday
Another birthday, another year
Today, today is your birthday
Another birthday, another year
Your birthday is here
Friendly faces
Are all right here
Smiling at you
A birthday cheer
Birthday candles

Blow them out
With delight
