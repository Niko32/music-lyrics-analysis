It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
It takes a worried man to sing a worried song
I'm worried now
But I won't be worried long

I went across the river, I lay down to sleep
I went across the river, I lay down to sleep
When I woke up
Had shackles on my feet

Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg
Twenty-nine links of chain around my leg
And on each leg
The initials of my name

CHORUS

I asked the judge, what might be my fine?
I asked the judge, what might be my fine?
Twenty-one years
On the Rocky Mountain Line

The train I ride, sixteen coaches long
The train I ride, sixteen coaches long
The girl I love
Is on that train and gone

If anyone asks you who composed this song
If anyone asks you who composed this song
Tell 'em was I
And I sing it all day long

CHORUS
