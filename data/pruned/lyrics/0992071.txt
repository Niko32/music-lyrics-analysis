Uh, it's Christmas, but
But there ain't nobody raisin' much of a fuss

[Verse 1]
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas
There ain't nobody raisin' no fuss
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas
There ain't nobody raisin' no fuss
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas
There ain't nobody raisin' no fuss
Christmas, Christmas, Christmas
There ain't nobody raisin' no fuss

[Instrumental 0:39 - 1:20]

Nobody but me
Haw, haw, haw
Haw, haw, haw
Haw, haw, haw

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
Nobody can do the shing-a-ling like I do
Nobody can do the skate like I do
Nobody can do the boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo

Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo, boogaloo
Boogaloo...
