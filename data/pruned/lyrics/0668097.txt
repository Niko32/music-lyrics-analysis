All life we work but work is a bore
If life's for livin', what's livin' for?
She lives in a house that's near decay
Built for the industrial revolution

[Chorus]
But in her dreams she is far away
In Oklahoma, U.S.A
With Shirley Jones and Gordon MacRae

[Verse 2]
While she buys her papers at the corner shop
She's walking on the surrey with the fringe on top

[Chorus]
Cause in her dreams she is far away
In Oklahoma, U.S.A

[Bridge]
She walks to work but she's still in a daze
She's Rita Hayworth or Doris Day
And Errol Flynn's gonna take her away
To Oklahoma, U. S. A

[Verse 1]
All life we work but work is a bore
If life's for livin', then what's livin' for?You might also like
