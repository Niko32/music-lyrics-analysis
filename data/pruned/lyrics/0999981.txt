I thought that life was runnin' off
Leavin' me behind
So like a fool, I jumped the fence
Just to see what I could find
But love kept disappearing
Like children chasing fireflies in the dark
And to think that I once had it all
In my own backyard

[Chorus]
You'd never know it now
But I used to have it all
A swing set and a plastic pool
A shaggy dog that lived to fetch a ball
An angel with a glass of tea
Laughin' at the kids and me
All soakin' wet from washin' that old car
And to think that I once had it all
In my own backyard

[Verse 2]
That bare spot's grown over
Where third base used to be
And the weeds have choked out all the flowers
But they can't kill the memories
Lord, I'd love to run back home
But there's no one there for me
And that grass I used to hate to mow
Sure is lookin' green
You might also like[Chorus]
You'd never know it now
But I used to have it all
A swing set and a plastic pool
A shaggy dog that lived to fetch a ball
An angel with a glass of tea
Laughin' at the kids and me
All soakin' wet from washin' that old car
And to think that I once had it all
In my own backyard

[Outro]
Oh, you'd never know it now
But I used to have it all
Once, I had everything
In my own back yard
