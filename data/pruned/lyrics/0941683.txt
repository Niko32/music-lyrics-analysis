Gazing through bottles, tables of endless glass
Light shined through and it seemed like heaven
Take all the bottles and put them end to end
You could touch the sky in another way

[Chorus]
When did you get up today?
You never used to sleep so late
Never mind, it's always 3 am

[Verse 2]
Smoky rooms and laughter, scattered bits of conversation
Faces melt into the air like rain
You can laugh, he won't know, that's not him you see
He's never really there and he doesn't know the time

[Chorus]
When did you get up today?
You never used to sleep so late
Never mind, it's always 3 am

[Verse 3]
Morning comes without a clue, he sees the day through ruined eyes
Wonders who this stranger is with fallen prophecy
Every time the same old thing, someone comes in with the night
Locks him in this foolish cell and throws away the key
You might also like[Chorus]
When did you get up today?
You never used to sleep so late
Never mind, it's always 3 am

[Chorus]
When did you get up today?
You never used to sleep so late
Ah, it's always 3 am
