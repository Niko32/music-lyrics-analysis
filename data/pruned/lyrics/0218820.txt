As I walk down the street
Everyone that I meet
Gives me a friendly hello
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so, mmm

The birds in every tree
They are so neighborly
They sing wherever I go
I guess I'm just a lucky so and so

[Bridge]
Ah, but if you ask the amount
In my bank account
I'll have to admit I'm kinda slippin'
Oh, but that don't bother me
'Cause confidentially
I've got a dream that's a-pippin'

[Verse 2]
And when the day is through
Each night I hurry to
Home where my love awaits, I know
I guess I'm, I got to be a lucky so and so

[Bridge]
Ah, but if you ask the amount
In my, in my bank account
I'll have to admit, oh, that I'm slippin'
But I know that don't bother me
'Cause confidentially
I've got a dream that's pippin'

Oh, and when the day is through
Each night I hurry to
Home where my love waits, I know
I guess I'm, I guess I'm, I got to be a lucky so and so
And oh, oh, I guess I know
I know I'm a lucky, lucky, lucky so and so
Ah, ha
