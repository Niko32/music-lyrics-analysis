She was sittin' at the table there were no tears in her eyes
It seemed so much unlike her to be so much at ease
She took a sip of coffee and softly said to me
"There's the mantle where we keep our wedding picture
There's the bedroom where we make both love and war
And there's the ring that keeps on slipping off your finger
There's no reason we should go on anymore and there's the door
So I'm back here on this barstool, my whole world gone to hell
Behind the bottles there's a mirror where a fool can see himself
If I was the man I should be and not the one I am
I would go back there this minute and beg for one more chance
There's the jukebox where I wasted all those quarters
Oh, there's a lady trying to get me out on the floor
And there's a chance the one I love would still forgive me
It's a step that I just never took before, there's the door
There's the door...You might also like
