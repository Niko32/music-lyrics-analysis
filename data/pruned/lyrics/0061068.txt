[Singing]

My girl's callin' gettin' on my nerves
She don't know that I'm off that herb
Boss trippin', bein' hella mean
He don't know that I'm off that green
Hi hater, oh you runnin' ya mouth?
I can't hear ya cuz my weed too loud
Ain't nobody finna bring me down
I'm just chillin' in the clouds

[Hook]
Now usually this would get on my nerves
But right now I don't care
Cuz I'm somewhere off my mind
High up in the air
Yeah I'm high-igh-igh-igh
High-igh-igh-igh
Said I'm high-igh-igh-igh
I'm too high to care

[Verse 2: Irv]
[Singing]

What's all the fuss about?
Tell me why's everybody so tight
Roll up and puff it out
Everything gon' be alright
Cuz I done had a long day already
(that's why I'm high right now)
So I won't let ya bullshit affect me
(I'm already in the clouds)

[Verse 3: Irv]
[Rapping]

I been smokin', my eyes low and
Everything ya sayin' to me makes no sense
Cuz I'm on one, naw I'm on three
Ya ever seen a 20 dollar bill on weed?
I'm just chillin' blowin' on trees
But my head on the ceiling when I'm on these
High strains that stimulate my brain
We finna get high mayne
So roll up that fire mayne
I'm gone
See I done took the time to blaze up
So it ain't nothin' you can do to mess my day up
I'll probably be doe tomorrow when I wake up
Cuz of them three blunts that I done took to the face yup
What? Oh somebody talkin' down now?
I can't even hear 'em cuz I'm blowin' on that loud now
And you can smell it from a mile away
And you ain't got shit to do, so I'mma get you high today
