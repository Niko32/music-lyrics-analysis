A kiss on the hand may be quite continental
But diamonds are a girl's best friend
A kiss may be grand, but it won't pay the rental
On your humble flat or help you at the automat
Men grow cold as girls grow old
We all lose our charm in the end
But square cut or pear shape
These rocks don't lose their shape
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Yeah diamonds are a girl's best friend
Let's rock

[Verse 2]
There may come a time when a lass needs a lawyer
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
There may come a time when a hard-boiled employer
Thinks you're awful nice, but get that ice or else no dice
He's your guy when stocks are high
But beware when they start to descend
It's then that those louses go back to their spouses
And diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Yea, diamonds are a girl's best friend
Let's rock again!

Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
Diamonds are a girl's best friend
