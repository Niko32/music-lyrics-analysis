I'll never keep you waiting
I'll never betray home
I'll never be un-giving
I'm never too far (gone, gone, gone)

I never wanna quit, I never wanna fall
I wanna be the man that you see me
I never wanna be that ear that you can't run to
I want you to trust and confide in me
Come

[Chorus]
Come now girl lets go (come now girl lets go)
Lady take my hand (lady take my hand, ill lead you)
Let me take you to (let me take you to where you'll never have to work for love)
Never, never land (a happy place, never have to worry about that)
Come now girl lets go (starting right now)
Lady take my hand(lady take my hand, yeah)
Let me take you to (let me take you to happy)
Never, never land
Come now lets go baby
Let me take you to never, never land
Never, never, never, never land

[Verse 2]
I'll never be un-invested
Cause you and I, girl we are rich with love
I'll never feel like we can't make it
Cause there's no obstacles we can't rise above
I'd rather have a 100 reasons to stay then 1 to leave
I never want to give you full thought not to believe
Cause you're my princess we go together
Like prince charming and Cinderella
When I'm with you girl I see your name in a fairytale
