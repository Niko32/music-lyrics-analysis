Communicating through my melodies I knew the world would help me through
Then I grew up to find that all the dreams I had in mind required more then my gift
More of the pain than the pleasure

Better safe than sorry
And here I am losing everything again
I'll never have to worry about the game
I'll never win I'll never lose
I'm not playing at all
Never gamble at all

Many years ago I met the one, and all my dreams of angels faded away
I opened up and even let her in, to kill the enemy within
And even though she tried to keep her love for me alive
Oh it kills me to say, I let it wither away again

Better safe than sorry
And here I am losing everything again
I'll never have to worry about the game
I'll never win I'll never lose
Better safe than sorry
And here I am losing everything again
I'll never have to worry about the game
I'll never win I'll never lose
I'm not playing at all
You might also likeOh, that I'm lonely
Without someone by my side
I long for the only person in this world who's a part of me
I'm taking back of all the things I've been going through
You gave me strength to carry on
I'll do the best I can to make you want to be around
I really need you in my life

And maybe I was born to wander through this world alone
I left a good life behind where my heart beating night forever

Better safe than sorry
And here I am losing everything again
I'll never have to worry about the game
I'll never win I'll never lose
Better safe than sorry
And here I am losing everything again
I'll never have to worry about the game
I'll never win I'll never lose
I'm not playing at all
