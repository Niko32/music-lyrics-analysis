She’s not quite like the
Conventional sister no she’s not
I've never seen her frown
Or hold her head down
I've never heard her say
“I’m bored” or “get away”

[Hook]
I tip top topple over for my fun loving nun
Cause she has so much fun, so much joy
And so much wonderful love for everyone

[Chorus] [x2]
She’s not like an ordinary person no she’s not
She turns a lonely room into a happy place
Transforms a grumpy look into a smiling face

[Hook]
I tip top topple over for my fun loving nun
Cause she has so much fun, so much joy
And so much wonderful love for everyone

[Verse 2]
Some of us get covered up by the world
Become bitter from our loneliness
And forget our dreams
But she takes notice of the beauty everywhere
And when she finds herself
She feels peaceful there
You might also like[Hook]
I tip top topple over for my fun loving nun
Cause she has so much fun, so much joy
And so much wonderful love for everyone
