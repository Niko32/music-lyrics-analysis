Made me change my plans
Walk in a different space
Loving you is all I seem to think about
And, will you let me go if I
Turn around and walk the other way
Or would you haunt my heart
For the rest of my life?

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be caught up in you and
I don't wanna have to see your face in every other woman

[Chorus]
(It gets hard to breathe)
Only when I'm next to you
I guess I got caught up in you
I gotta break these chains
(It's so hard to sleep)
I feel your love is closing in
Forcing me to play my hand
And I don't wanna win, yeah

[Verse 2]
Losing sleep for days
The distraction that you made
Keeping me from moving on
Piecing back my life
Would it be this way if I
Had never fell in love with you
I think it'd be quite alright
If I never knew your name
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna be caught up in you
And I don't wanna be seeing your face in every other woman

[Chorus]
(It gets hard to breathe)
Only when I'm next to you
I guess I got caught up in you
I gotta break these chains
(It's so hard to sleep)
I feel your love is closing in
Forcing me to play my hand
And I don't wanna win, yeah

[Bridge]
Moving just too much
Think I'm giving up
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
(It gets hard to breathe)
Only when I'm next to you
I guess I got caught up in you
I wanna break these chains
(It's so hard to sleep)
I feel your love is closing in
Feel your love closing in on me, oh, oh
(It gets hard to breathe)
[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
(It's so hard to sleep)
I'm up late at night
'Cause I thought I saw you in my dreams
I thought I saw you in my dreams
