From the start I had a lot of heart
But I was told it wasn't nesscesary
I started thinking with my mind
And Everything became very scary
But then I focused on the light
I started questioning my life
Like where in the world do I go from here
I guess I gotta get me right

[Verse 1]
Stay to myself, I dont need a soul
I don't need ya help, dont add to my woes
Dont even think about it, we gon get around it
Its when you think about it thats what gets you down
And i know thats what I feel, fightin for another chance
But lets just keep it real, let me show you where I stand
And Imma make for sure that you dont pull back on them curtains
And I can front you what i know, but no you do not owe me

[Hook]
Get up out yo mind (breath)

[Verse 2]
I found myself and now I feel amazing
I onced was caged in, and now I feel like im cajun
Because I'm hot, because of Mims I am not
But I am certified by me, dont even lable me an e-m-cee
This is what I do for fun, I got ammo like a gun
This is my shooting range and you can get it all at once
Like a target, hip hops super market
But im underground, but a king just record me
If you want the real all you gotta do is ask me
And I be the one that you won't even have to ask twice
Plus I'm twice as nice than your favorite rapper
I'll Pull these niggas out these wrappers they're only actors
They're not a factor to me
They are just for laughterYou might also like
