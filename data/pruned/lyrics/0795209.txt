We shed our tears…
The stone cold of their hearts
Won’t let us go!
And the screams are here…
We’re fed on fear…
When will the spite of Men
End this world?
The famished still beg
For a piece of bread to eat!
The wounded still roam dying alone
Through the streets!
Wars and wars
More chaos and destruction!
Rampage runs the Earth
On her cruel aggression!
As the end is near…
We shed our tears…
The stone cold of their hearts
Won’t let us go!
And the screams are here…
We’re fed on fear…
When will the spite of Men
End this world?
Rivalry was raised
As a premise in the human perception!
Scourge as been awakened
And impiety still stands!
When will we crush the spite?You might also like
