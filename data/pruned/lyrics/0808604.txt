Verse 1
Sparkling dew soaks the dawn grass
Announcing the nightime's decay
Morning larks on the lawns massed
Signify a new born day
Welcomed rays that the sun casts
Gleam brighter in every single way

Chorus:
Now from the dismal gloom
Of nights incarcerate tomb
Shines your celestial light
Heavenly, sacred sight
Shine on celestial light
A year's full cycle
Are dead and gone long ago
Lambs are playing Sherwood's arraying
Her leafy splendour for to show
Verse 2
You're as fresh as the daybreak
As radiant as the early morning sun
All the weathering of the years make
Your splendour a sight second to none
And mortals from their sleep will wake
To view you for a thousand years on
Chorus
