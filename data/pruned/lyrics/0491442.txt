It's amazing the time that it's taken
For you to come out here
I don't know what you do in there
Only so many ways you can change
How light will hit your face
Or how you can fix your hair

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You only got two eyes, two lips, so why
It shouldn't really take long at all
But when you finally smile cause it's just right
Damn, you look beautiful

[Chorus]
You take forever, ever, ever, ever
But you're always worth waiting for
You take forever, ever, ever, ever
I guess I'll wait a little more
Now, I know it's time I realize
I will be waiting half my life
With my back up against the door
Cause you take forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
But you're always worth waiting for

[Verse 2]
And you lie through your teeth
When you try to convince me that you'll be
That you'll be out in less than five
Cause we both know that the only way you will ever leave
Is if we set the whole place on fire
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
You already said you had the perfect dress
So why you got to try them all
No matter how late it gets, I must confess
Damn, you look beautiful

[Chorus]
You take forever, ever, ever, ever
But you're always worth waiting for
You take forever, ever, ever, ever
I guess I'll wait a little more
Now, I know it's time I realize
I will be waiting half my life
With my back up against the door
Cause you take forever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever
But you're always worth waiting for

[Outro]
You take forever, ever, ever, ever
I guess I'll wait a little more
Na na na, whoa, oh, whoa, yeah
Whoa, oh, whoa
I guess I'll wait a little more
