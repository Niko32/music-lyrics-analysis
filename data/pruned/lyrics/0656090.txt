Well down at the bottom of that dirty old river
Down where the reeds and the catfish play
There lies a dream as soft as the water
There lies a bluebird that's flown away

[Verse 2]
Well, to meet is like springtime and to love is like the summer
Her brown eyes shone for nobody but me
Then autumn, forever the fool, come a-falling
And the rain turned to freezing inside of me

[Verse 3]
I'll kindle my fires with the words I can't send you
And the roads I can't follow and the songs I can't sing
I'll wander alone on the sleigh bells of winter
With the stars for a diamond and the world for a ring

[Verse 4]
Well, all you young ladies who dream of tomorrow
While you're listening, these words will I say
Cling to today with its joy and its sorrow
You'll need all your memories when youth melts away

[Verse 5]
Well, the angel of springtime, he rides down the south wind
The angel of summer, he does just the same
The angel of autumn, she's blue and she's golden
And the angel of winter won't remember your name

Well down at the bottom of that dirty old river
Down where the reeds and the catfish play
There lies a dream as soft as the water
There lies a bluebird that's flown away
Oh there lies a bluebird that's flown away
