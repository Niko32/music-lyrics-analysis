The pack of wolves are closing in
Now, hear the howling beasts
They move fast through winter woods
And soon it's time to feast
A vicious hunt on through the night
The prey is short of breath
They feel the sting of burning eyes
That's fixed upon their necks

[Chorus]
A predator's heart
Knows no remorse
It lives for the hunt
A predator's heart
Knows no remorse
It lives for the hunt
A natural force

[Verse 2]
They show their sharp and grinning teeth
As howls are getting higher
Sending chills down fleeing spines
Their blood runs hot as fire
The vicious chase is soon at end
They're hunted until death
They feel the pain of sharpened steel
That's cutting through their flesh
Fearless warriors feed the wolves
Now hear the howling beasts
They move fast through winter woods
See the grey-backs feast

[Chorus]
A natural force
It knows no remorse
And lives for the kill
