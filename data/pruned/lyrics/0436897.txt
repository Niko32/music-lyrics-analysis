Them that's god shall get
Them that's not shall lose
So the bible says
And it still is news

[Chorus]
Momma may have
Poppa may have
God bless the child
That's got his own
That's got his own

[Verse 2]
Well, the strong gets more
While the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't
Ever make the grade

[Chorus]
Momma may have
Poppa may have
God bless the child
That's got his own
That's got his own
You might also like[Verse 3]
You've got lots of friends
Crowding round the door
And when it's gone and
Spending ends
Rich relations will give you
A crust of bread and such
You can help yourself
But don't take too much

[Chorus]
Momma may have
Poppa may have
God bless the child
That's got his own
That's got his own
