"Hey friend, you don't know me
But you think you do
And I want you too
I'm everybody's friend
And I'm personally connected with you
This song's on the house
And this one's for you
I don't like the way you're treating me
I want a fight. Settle it right
I forgot your name but I'd be happy to
Beat you to death with a pool cue."You might also like
