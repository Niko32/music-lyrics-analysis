See how it trembles
Givin' in, drifting off
A boy lit a cigarette
While the girl closed the door
These hopeless romantic fools
Won’t be lovers no more

But see how the waves are rushing in
And see how the waves are washing off
Leaving the shore so pure
Cleansing until it’s white as snow

A dear's gasping for air
It’s made its last mistake
A fool for old nature’s rules
Drifts away in the wake of the dawn
A car leaves the front yard
Of a house she calls home
Her man won’t be back again
Won’t be home anymore

But see how the waves are rushing in
And see how the waves are washing off
Leaving the shore so pure
Cleansing until it’s white as snow
