Well I lost a good woman by stayin' out every night
Yes I thought I was doing good and I wasn't treating a good woman right
Well I'm goin' back to my woman, I'm a fall down on my knees
Well I'm goin' back to that woman, I'm a fall down on my knees
Say take me back, take me back baby, forgive me if you please
I say you was right, you was right, I just acknowledge that I was wrong
You were right, you were right, I just acknowledge that I was wrong
I know I have made a mistake baby, when I drove you from my home
(Mickey's solo) All right there...
I wanted to beg you back baby, but I was really ashamed of myself
I wanted to beg you back baby, but I was really ashamed of myself
But if you only come back good mama, I'll never be bad againYou might also like
