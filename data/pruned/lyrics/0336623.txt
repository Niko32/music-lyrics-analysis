Your mind's made up
You're going to leave
Nothing I can say will stop you so it seems
But before you up and go
There's just something you should know
When you find that I'm the one you still need

[Chorus]
One thin dime
Is all it takes
When you need someone who cares
These arms of mine
Are always open
One thin dime is all you need
And I'll be there

[Verse 2]
Oh, you're chasing rainbows and I understand
When you're through I'll take you back again
I'll be waiting patiently
For when you come back to me
There's nobody else can love you like I can

[Chorus]
One thin dime
Is all it takes
When you need someone who cares
These arms of mine
Are always open
One thin dime is all you need
And I'll be there
You might also like[Verse 3]
You know the number
I'm always home
So honey just pick up and dial that telephone
When this world treats you unkind
Get your mama on the line
There's no need for you to ever be alone

[Chorus]
One thin dime
Is all it takes
When you need someone who cares
These arms of mine
Are always open
One thin dime is all you need
And I'll be there

[Outro]
These arms of mine
Oh, they're always open
One thin dime is all you need
And I'll be there
