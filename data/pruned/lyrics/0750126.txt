Here: every act is a crime
Here: every presence a poison
Here: every wall is a spy

When you say "turn", they all start to turn
When you say "dive", they're all on their knees

Chorus
Pretending to guide me, you led me astray
I don't want to fall into your kind of ways
I will never sway

Here: every move is an error
Here: every breath is a fact
Turn (x2)! Start! Turn (x2)! Dive!
Here: every ear is a danger
Here: every smile is a trap
Here...

Pretending to guide me, you led me astray
I don't want to fall into your kind of ways

I know you'll never take me
Don't even think you'll break me
Be sure you'll never thank me
I'm gonna make you see

Here: every word is a bite

Turn (X2)! Start! Turn (X2)! Dive!
