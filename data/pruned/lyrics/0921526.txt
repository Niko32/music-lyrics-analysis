It could have gone either way
When it came down to the choice
To keep the life within
A life that had no voice
It must have surely seemed
The harder road to choose
To be so young to have to say
Who had the most to lose

But she came through like a champ
And she blessed the world that day
Then gave the hope of a better life
When she gave him away
Now the innocence and joy
Is there each day he wakes
Expressions of his love of life
In every breath he takes

He could have been thrown away
Before he had a chance to say

Hey world
I am here and I have something to give
Hey world
I'm alive and I am wanting to live

I am here and I have something to give
Hey world
I'm alive and I am wanting to live

He turned to lock the door
As he wiped away a tear
The hopelessness of missing love
His adolescent fear
As he struggled for the strength
To put the gun away
He found the courage and the hope
To face another day

He could have been blown away
Before he had a chance to say

Hey world
I am here and I have something to give
Hey world
I'm alive and I am wanting to live

Hey world
I am here and I have something to give
Hey world
I'm alive and I am wanting to live
Down the corridor or life
In between our death and birth
We may start to lose our way
In the search to find our worth
Our value comes in the fact we live
Life is a gift only God can give

Hey world
I'm alive and I am wanting to live

Hey world
I'm here and I have something to give
Hey world
I'm alive and I am wanting to live
Hey world
