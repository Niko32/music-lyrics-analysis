Hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Woo
Woo

[Verse 1]
Hello (Hello)
It's been a while since I've seen your smile (Smile)
I've had my eyes wide open for the longest time
Hopefully I'd see you on TV or a motion movie
The strangest thing (Strangest thing)
Happened to me just the other day
I heard a voice and I called out your name
As a speeding cab pulled off from me, from me

[Chorus]
Been a while since I've seen your smile
And I don't know when I'll see you again
Hopefully soon in old Magnolia's room
Where I will be waiting

[Verse 2]
The chances are (Chances are)
You picked up, packed up, didn't go real far
Maybe you're resting on the other side of town
Hopefully waiting to be found, be found
The strangest thing (Strangest thing)
Happened to me just the other day
I saw your picture and I called out your name
As a speeding cab pulled off from me, from me
You might also like[Chorus]
Been a while since I've seen your smile
And I don't know when I'll see you again
Hopefully soon in old Magnolia's room where I will be waiting
(Waiting for you)
Been a while (Been a while) since I've seen your smile
And I don't know when I'll see you again
Hopefully soon (Soon) in old Magnolia's room
Where I will be waiting for you

[Bridge]
For you, I would swim 'cross the ocean
Fly 'cross the widest sea for you
For you, there ain't nothing in the world
That I won't give to make you happy
I gave up my nightlife to be by your side
Only if it will bring you home to me

[Chorus]
Been a while since I've seen your smile
And I don't know when (I don't know when, baby)
I'll see you again (I don't know)
Hopefully soon in old Magnolia's room
Where I will be waiting
(I will be waiting, baby; I will be waiting)
Been a while since I've seen your smile
And I don't know when
(It's been a long, long, long, long time)
I'll see you again
Hopefully soon in old Magnolia's room
Where I will be waiting
(I will be waiting, I will be waiting)
Been a while since I've seen your smile
And I don't know when I'll see you again (I don't know)
Hopefully soon in old Magnolia's room
Where I will be waiting
(I will be waiting, oh, no, no)
[Outro]
(Been a while) Said it's been
Such a long, long, long, long time, yeah
Oh, oh, Magnolia's room is getting kinda cold
And you've been gone too long, too long, yeah
And I'm going crazy, baby, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woo, hey
