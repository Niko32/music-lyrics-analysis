There are those who'd love to love me
Take me home and take care of me
Treat me just the way you never do
But I'm here on your doorstep
Something I can't seem to help
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you

[Chorus]
Oh, you don't love me, you don't love me
You place everything above me
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you
You don't want me, you don't want me
You just hurt and disappoint me
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you, ooh, ooh
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you

[Verse 2]
What is this spell that's on me?
Makes me think you own me
Why do I keep holdin' on to you?
I just can't shake the feeling
I only know it's real
And I keep holdin', holdin', holdin' on to you

[Chorus]
Oh, you don't love me, you don't love me
You place everything above me
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you
You don't want me, you don't want me
You just hurt and disappoint me
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you, ooh, ooh
Like a fool, I'm holdin' on to you

Holdin' on to you
Holdin' holdin' on to you
Holdin' holdin' on to you
I just keep holdin'
I just keep holdin'
I just keep holdin' on to you
Why do I keep holdin'
Holdin' holdin' on to you
Holdin' holdin' on to you
