A marathon of nosebleeds
Heads down on the glass

Your eyes are red and you’re convinced
You’re made of gold
And you won't stop until
You’re finding inspiration on the bathroom floor

The night’s not over until it’s overdone
Until you overindulge
The night’s not over until you’re over her

Tonight we’re on top of the world
And we’re not coming down

I’ll see you in the ICUYou might also like
