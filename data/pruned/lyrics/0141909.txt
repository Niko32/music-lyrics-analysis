As we gaze upon stars
With dreams to go far
We fuse with these means to stack cheese you see
And as we proceed to give you what you need
We get it by any means in the county of the kings x2
Its just another day in the county of the kings
Its just another night in the county of the kings
We in the county of the kings

Verse Chachi:
Another night in kings county with my niggas
Smoking on the dankest loud,this ain't for no beginners.
Talkin' bout some shit that we probably won't remember
Probably cuz' we mixing stimulants with some depressants
But fuck it 
There's only one time that you livin'
We poppin' mollies with shorty's that wanna' get lifted
Turning all these good girls into bad bitches
Especially when the liquor hits the system
Now listen
To your conscious talking you can feel it
All of these emotions they go in
Ballistic
With god on my right and the devil on my left
To sin or not to sin...that is the question
It is what it is and it was what it was
They all in my ear and they blowin' my buzz
Im doing my thing im just livin' my life
Live from BK its just another night

Verse Khari:
Another night in kings county
With my head on the bounty
Money on my mind get ya head out the gutter
Your equinox fluttered
And your trynna' grip butter
Slippy tip fingers on the mic
Shit stuttered
You choked out this scene
Man you trynna' get nutted
You grinding weak shit like your sex game
Fuck it
No soul attached your ego prone whack its a fact that your artificial on the boom bap
Work with metronomes so you dont get juiced by the men in tiny suits looking for a group to soup
Mix em in the pot no sir i will not
Won't be afraid of the man with the shades
And i won't shake your hand even if you just blazed

Walker
From the dark side to the light
Evolution got my eyes seeing right
Its live from bk its just another night
