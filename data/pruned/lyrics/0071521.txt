This me I'm still the same

After you pay attention please collect your change

I'm doing me don't want no problems

Papa was a rolling stone but still a role model

But he did the best for me and my brothers

His wife raising the kids he should be thanking my mother

He shouldn't be taking another

Broken hearts will recover

And I get high yall can't even hover
Waking up early in the morning the
Money never sleep I'm bearly yawning

Leave some girls relationship got boring

Looked in the mirror all I saw was an opponent

Heading to the top I'm coming home
You might also likeL.O.L ha ha yeah funny bone

Cloudy days is coming yeah sun is gone

Problems coming back now the moneys gone

[Introlude]
This my realest song right my own song
Puting it on rapgenius hoping I would get discoverd by lil wayne
Funny right?yeah anyway

[Verse 2]
Rainy days where the sunshine

When we where struggling I saw y'all less then one time

Now I'm rapping now get the punchlines

Money's here see y'all more than enough times

But I guess that's something called life

Daddy's working hard can't see he's kids n his wife

Haters being cruel acting like all there nice
But don't have to love just try n be polite

Back again Like I put it in reverse

And times where getting blue and I ain't talking bout the smurfs

I just talk the truth so I put it in a verse

Well it didn't kill me but sure did hurt

Peace I'm out
