You chill everything that you see
You chilled the nerves that live in me
With your eyes, they never lie

[Pre-Chorus]
Deep as the ocean, cold like the sea
I’m lost and you're stoned
You poured it out on me
With your eyes, they never lie

[Chorus]
Oh she's never coming back
To me
She’s never coming back
To me

[Verse 2]
I see her in my hands
I know she’s in my soul
But she left me here trailing
In the cold December snow
Oh her smile, Oh her smile

[Pre-Chorus]
Deep as the ocean, cold like the sea
I’m lost in your storm
You poured it out on me
With your eyes they never lie
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh she's never coming back
To me
She’s never coming back
To me
Oh, she’s never coming back
To me
Oh, she’s never coming back
To me
Oh, she’s never coming back
To me
