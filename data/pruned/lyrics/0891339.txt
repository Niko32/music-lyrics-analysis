A scarecrow and a yellow moon
And a roadhouse on the edge of town
Hear that midnight rooster crow
Well, I'll have one more before I go
But Honey, don't turn out the light
'Cause I think I'm in the mood for love tonight

[Verse 2]
The night is cool beneath the stars
Ridin' home in John's old car
Got my head out in the wind
Here I am drunked up again
But Honey, don't turn out the light
'Cause I think I'm in the mood for love tonight

[Verse 3]
Me and John in a pickup truck
Bottle of gin and a paper cup
Runnin' wild and livin' hard
I passed out in our front yard
But Honey, don't turn out the light
'Cause I think I'm in the mood for love tonight

[Verse 4]
The moon is high, the sun is down
Honey came out in her night gown
On the porch at a quarter-to-three
Talkin' to the deputy sheriff and me
But Honey, don't turn out the light
'Cause I think I'm in the mood for love tonight
I said Honey, don't turn out the light
'Cause I think I'm in the mood for love tonight
And I said Honey, don't turn out the light
'Cause I think I'm in the mood for love tonightYou might also like
