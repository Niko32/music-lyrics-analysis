And yo bitch going change
All I wanted was the love but ain't shit goin be the same
So the only way to work
Is to put blood on the work
That's that real shit coming
Cause that real shit first

Niggas hate for the moment
Then I work for the moment
Then they see the bandwagon
Now I see them jumping on it
Whats the deal with these niggas
What's the deal with these hoes
Sick and tired of the hate
But I got love for my foes
A billion people around and still  real all alone
I feel like a defect because I walk among clones
Get the fuck out my face
I just hate to see fake
Favors with they hand outs
Nigga I don't owe you shit
And
Still I Keep My Composure
Still I Keep My Composure
Still I Keep My Composure
Still I Keep My Composure
Still I Keep My Composure
Still I Keep My Composure
Still I Keep My Composure
Still I Keep My Composure
You might also likeBitches ask for my advice like how would I even know
If what I say can help you
Then when IM sitting single
Man I hate the friend zone
IM yelling fuck me please
Cause love is not what you want
That shit will make you bleed

You see yo niggas goin change
And yo bitch going change
All I wanted was the love but ain't shit goin be the same
So the only way to work
Is to put blood on the work
That's that real shit coming
Cause that real shit first

That's that real shit coming
Cause that real shit first
That's that real shit coming
Cause that real shit first
That's that real shit coming
Cause that real shit first
That's that real shit coming
Cause that real shit first
