I've searched high and low
I've looked deep inside
But how can I know
For such a long time
I've hoped for a sign
That one day I'd find
We've been and found
Either inside or out
I have to take time
Your meaning contained
Your value displayed
By speaking your name

[Post-Chorus]
You revealed yourself in a dream
Then you told me how to believe

[Refrain]
Dreaming, I'm dreaming
I can still believe in
I'm dreaming I can still believe in you

[Chorus]
I've searched high and low
I've looked deep inside
But how can I know
For such a long time
I've hoped for a sign
That one day I'd find
We've been and found
Either inside or out
I have to take time
Your meaning contained
Your value displayed
By speaking your name
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
You revealed yourself in a dream
Then you told me how to believe

[Refrain]
Dreaming, I'm dreaming
I can still believe in
I'm dreaming I can still believe in you
Dreaming, I'm dreaming
I can still believe in
I'm dreaming I can still believe in you
I'm Dreaming, I'm dreaming
I can still believe in
I'm dreaming I can still believe in you
