You could have been more than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard

[Verse]
While you still have the time you could get away and find
A better life, you know the grind is so ungrateful
Racing cars, whisky bars
No one cares who you really are

[Bridge]
You're the keeper of the cards
Yes, I know it gets hard keeping the wheels turning
And the wife she keeps the keys
She is so pleased to be a part of the arrangement

[Chorus]
You could have been more than a name on the door
On the thirty-third floor in the air
More than a consumer
Lying in some room trying to die
More than a credit card
Swimming pool in the backyard
You might also like[Outro]
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, dee
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more than a name on the door
You could have been more
You could have been more
You could have been more
