We've been through the storm
We've been through it all
We had some close calls
But never would fall
We climbed all the mountains
Walked through all the valleys
And you never left me behind

[Pre-Chorus]
I found my way through the clouds
No more runnin' scared and closing my eyes, oh
I will be true, this love from my heart
I'm laying my life on the line

[Chorus]
Oh, I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side (hey)
I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger)

[Verse 2]
They said we wouldn't make it
But guess what, we made it
And we got them wondering how
You were always for me
Never been the one to hurt me
You gave me peace of mind
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I found my way through the clouds
No more runnin' scared and closing my eyes, oh
I will be true, this love from my heart
I'm laying my life on the line

[Chorus]
Oh, I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side (hey)
I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger)

[Bridge]
Sometimes I can't believe
That you are with me
There's nobody lucky as me
So I get on my knees
To make sure that He
Knows that I'm grateful
For what He gave me

[Chorus]
Oh, I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side (hey)
I will survive (hey, hey)
As long as it's you by my side
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger, stronger, stronger)
I'm stronger, stronger, stronger (stronger, stronger)
