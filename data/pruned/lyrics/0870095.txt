As they’re marching through the square
As they’re running for the Tube train
That could take them anywhere

Do you think and imagine
Where exactly that is
Will they kiss
Will they kiss

Well I dream of overtime
Rush hour trains that will be mine
I dream of overtime and
Rush hour trains and parking fines

We stand line by line
Everybody’s feeling fine
Tickets in our hands
So many dreams and plans

We dream nine to five
It’s better than a Soho dive
It’s better than anything anything

We dream of overtime and
Rush hour trains that will be mine
We dream of overtime and
Rush hour trains and parking fines
