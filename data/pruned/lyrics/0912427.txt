Night I was thinking 'bout her
Always man I'm thinking 'bout her
You could tell I'm drifting in and out when I'm thinking 'bout her
You could tell I'm smiling when I write and I'm thinking 'bout her
All the blues lose a little color when I'm thinking 'bout her
All the little things that she does keep me up
Night's occupied with her presence in a cup
Filled to the brim with a wink and a smile
These small thoughts that I wrestle for a while
Thinking 'bout her
I was thinking 'bout me
I was thinking 'bout us
I was trying to gain trust
Play it cool
Stay friends
Keep it up
Pretend
Go for the gold
Have a story to be told
Situations in my mind what'll play out
Ask her on a date or be consumed by doubt
The small details that I need to figure out
But I'm done playing safe I think I've found my route

[Hook:]
You plus me life's better with two
But I think I'll always be better with you
And if I wanna stay real honest and true
I think that I'll always be better with you
Better with you (x3)

Half of a whole
Hard to count like a mole
Hard to catch like a fall
And my heart that you stole
You need to give it back
Before I take yours too
Leave you right here with a thought more to chew
I see white rice
Bright lights in our future
I see long looks
Baby books in our past
Today is a gift
So we'll start and we'll last
And it all starts somewhere the first chloroplast
See if I can summon my courage and might
Adrenaline is running it's fight or its flight
Will they or won't they the teenage plight
My hands getting clammy it's lust no it's fright
Who ever even knows if I'm wrong or I'm right
Who ever even knows what I'll do on sight
I'm too scared to speak so I'll think and I'll write
That this is what I think about
