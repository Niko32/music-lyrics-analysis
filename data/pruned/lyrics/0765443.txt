I remember the day when we first met
We both got caught in the rain
And we were soaking wet
I looked in your eyes
You gave me a smile
You told me your name
You told me about your career
I told you about my hopes, my dreams, my fears
We had some laughs
One month has past
Tonight, can't you stay, can you stay?

[Chorus]
Now that the time is feeling just right
Candles burnin', turnin' out the lights
Anticipate the feelin' of your skin
Shall we begin? (Shall we begin?)
Hit repeat and let the music play
Until the night turns into day
Open-up your heart and let me in
Shall we begin?

[Verse 2]
Over time we've gotten closer than close
You're the one I wanna be with the most
Neither one of us was in a rush
Agreeing to wait
Now I feel my patience running thin
Anticipating when you tell me when
The time is now, tell me you'll stay
You might also like[Chorus]
Now that the time is feeling just right
Candles burnin', turnin' out the lights
Anticipate the feelin' of your skin
Shall we begin? (Shall we begin?)
Hit repeat and let the music play
Until the night turns into day
Open-up your heart and let me in
Shall we begin?

[Bridge]
We're gonna take our time
We're gonna take our time
Don't hesitate to come inside
Relax your mind
Everything is alright
The candlelight and you
Just pour the wine
We're gonna take it nice and slow
Auto pilot, steady as we go
Not in a hurry, no
'Til I hear you say
That you're so glad you stayed, yeah

[Chorus]
Now that the time is feeling just right
Candles burnin', turnin' out the lights
Anticipate the feelin' of your skin
Shall we begin?
(Shall we begin? Shall we begin? Shall we begin?)
Hit repeat and let the music play
Until the night turns into day
Open-up your heart and let me in
Shall we begin?
(Shall we begin? Shall we begin? Shall we begin?)
Now that the time is feeling just right
Candles burnin', turnin' out the lights
Anticipate the feelin' of your skin
Shall we begin?
(Shall we begin? Shall we begin? Shall we begin?)
Hit repeat and let the music play
Until the night turns into day
Open-up your heart and let me in
Shall we begin?
(Shall we begin? Shall we begin? Shall we begin?)
Now that the time is feeling just right
Candles burnin', turnin' out the lights
Anticipate the feelin' of your skin
Shall we begin?
(Shall we begin? Shall we begin? Shall we begin?)
