[Verse 1]
Venetian expertise, inspired by Titian
Which he modified, fine tuned along dutch lines
He's painting revenge
Embittered by lack of success, oh

[Verse 2]
With signature techniques, attention to details
And fine tell tale brushstrokes of badger and sable
Expressing contempt, oh
For greedy dealers getting rich at the artist's expense

[Chorus]
Infamous forger and restorer
Judas unrepentant
Branded a charming old lovable rogue
Judas unrepentant
Hey! (Judas unrepentant)
Hey! (Judas)

[Verse 3]
His time bombs are in place and anachronisms
Clues pointing to the truth if ever they are X-rayed
Wrote legends in lead white to trick the experts
And hoodwink, hoodwink the trained eye
You might also like[Chorus]
Infamous forger and restorer
Judas unrepentant
Branded a charming old lovable rogue
Judas unrepentant
Hey! (Judas unrepentant)
Hey! (Judas unrepentant)

[Post-Chorus]
Establishing provenance
Acquiring old frames with Christies numbers
Then paints a picture in the same style
Specialising in minor works by major artists

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
"All rise!"
Thirteen watercolours by Samuel Palmer
Have proven to be his undoing
And so he confesses, then he is arrested
Charged him with conspiracy to defraud

Years of chain smoking and breathing in fumes from restorations
The stress of the court case had taken its toll
His trial was halted due to ill health
[Pre-Chorus]
So now we can all buy real genuine fakes
(Ah, ah) That's posthumous fame, it's always the same

[Chorus]
Infamous forger and restorer
Judas unrepentant
Branded a charming old lovable rogue
Judas unrepentant

Feeling like Robin Hood, just as good
As Rembrandt or Titian
Hey! (Judas unrepentant)
Hey! (Judas unrepentant)
Judas unrepentant!

[Outro]
