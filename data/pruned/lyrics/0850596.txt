Listen

[Verse 1]
Something about you that I can’t explain
Compared to the other girls, you’re not the same
Your hairstyle is different, your walk is too
When you’re in doubt, you ask what to do

[Chorus]
Do what you want to
(I will love you anyway, hey)

[Verse 2]
Time you stopped listening to what they say
It’s time to pass on and live your best today
Stay out of trouble as much as you can
I’ll always remain your man

[Chorus]
Do what you want to
(I will love you anyway)
(Not just one, but every day)

[Bridge]
In my eyes, you can do no wrong
That’s why I keep on singing this song
You might also like[Verse 3]
Yours is a property that’s hard to find
Whatever you do, bear this in mind
In my eyes, you can do no wrong
A kiss from you makes Billy strong

[Chorus]
Do what you want to
(I will love you anyway, hey)
(I will love you anyway, hey)
(I will love you anyway, hey)

[Chorus]
Do what you want to, baby
Do what you want to
(I will love you anyway)

[Verse 4]
Time you stopped listening to what folks say
It’s time to pass on and live your best today
Stay out of trouble as much as you can
And I’ll always remain your man

[Chorus]
Do what you want to
(I will love you anyway, hey)
Do what you want to
Come on, now, come on
Get it, get it, get it, get it
Get it, get it, get it
(I will love you anyway, hey)
[Outro]
(I will love you anyway, hey)
(I will love you anyway, hey)
(I will love you anyway, hey)
(I will love you anyway, hey)…
