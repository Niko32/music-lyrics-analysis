I ain't looking for confession, I ain't come to raise the dead
I ain't much for you to offer, just a cargo of tears and of pain
I ain't come here for forgiveness, I'm not paying for my sins
I betrayed you, my sweet Jesus, I have chosen hell on Earth

[Chorus]
I will get away with murder
I will get away with crime
It's the innocence I rape
I won't stop until I'm done

[Verse 2]
I ain't come here for a coffee, I ain't looking for no fun
Don't expect me to be sober, well, you know I'm running wild
I don't wear no crown of thorns, well, you know I never pray
I won't offer no salvation, I was born to raise some Hell

[Chorus]
I will get away with murder
I will get away with crime
It's the innocence I rape
I won't stop until I'm done

[Verse 3]
In the garden, met my old friend, he's the one with many names
You have always been like a brother, good to have you back again
Now I wear my graveyard suit and I smoke a black cigars
I sing "Hosanna, Hosanna" at the funeral of the God
You might also like[Chorus]
I will get away with murder
I will get away with crime
It's the innocence I rape
I won't stop until I'm done

[Outro]
We ain't come here for forgiveness, we're not paying for our sins
We betrayed you, our sweet Jesus, we have chosen hell on Earth
We ain't come here for forgiveness, we're not paying for our sins
We betrayed you, our sweet Jesus, we have chosen hell on Earth
We ain't come here for forgiveness, we're not paying for our sins
We betrayed you, our sweet Jesus, we have chosen hell on Earth
We ain't come here for forgiveness, we're not paying for our sins
We betrayed you, our sweet Jesus, we have chosen hell on Earth
