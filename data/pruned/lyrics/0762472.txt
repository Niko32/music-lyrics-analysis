I ran outside and ran back in
And I just couldn't get away from myself
I don't care what tomorrow brings
I won't back down for anything
I want to think that I was made for something else
I can't wait anymore
I'm ready to reach
So I'm closing the door behind me
All that I can do is hold onto you
And follow where you lead
Where you're leading me
All that I can do is hold onto you
And let you bring me through
It's all that I can do
There are days I think I don't need you
There are days when I can't see the truth
I need you to save me from the lies
Because every thought that's in my head
And even when I draw my next breath
You knew it all before there was time
When the waves begin to rise
And all my hope fails
In confidence I'll close my eyes
Trusting you'll be thereYou might also like
