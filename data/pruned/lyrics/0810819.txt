And said things that I wish I hadn't
Felt bad for animals in a zoo
Wanted to walk in someone else's shoes
Have you? Have you?

I've spilled secrets by accident
And kept ones that I wish I hadn't
Washed my denims with my whites and turned em blue
Waited in vain for the truth
Have you? Have you?

Have you needed to know that someone other than you feels this way
I do need to know so I don't think I'm going crazy

I've forgotten to pay parking tickets
Gave my love to one who didn't want it
Imagined my funeral and who'd come through
Did what was right when I didn't want to
Have you? Have you?

Have you needed to know that someone other than you feels this way
Have you needed to know that someone other than you feels this way

I was wondering… have you?
And I was wondering… have you?
And I was wondering… have you?
Have you needed to know that you're not alone?
Have you? Have you needed to know that you're not alone?
I do, I do
Ever needed to know that you're not alone?
Have you?You might also like
