My heart it goes out to that poor little Dutch boy
Who stopped a great flood with the tip of his thumb
Through parades and medals he felt no joy
And took to his bed with a bottle of rum

[Verse 2]
The queen she arrived in her motorcade
To give the good Dutch boy a commemorative pen
But he watched as the milkmaids all withered and grayed
And he knew that the waters must rise again

[Verse 3]
Because the world is made up of milk and scissors
Milk and scissors in a spiraling chain
Milk and scissors like a cheap squirting flower
Milk and scissors like worms when it rainsYou might also like
