Yeah
Hahaha
I don't know, I just thought every rap song is supposed to start with a "yeah"
I don't rap though so I wouldn't know
I just wanted a better way to get my feelings out
You know?

[Chorus 1]
This is for the kids rapping in the high stands
The up and coming artists fiendin' for high demand
The folks that’d be dreamin' seeing it’s all grand
Young Simba conquering take back the Pride Lands
Check it out

[Verse 1]
You would never understand my story
Follow no path, no guidance before me
No one believed ‘till I made it, the top
But people still questionin' why I’m hot
Well, why not?
Cuz' I got the passion your ass can’t fathom
Lights, Cameras, n' Action, the main attraction
Was a young boy so feeble
But now with God’s plan, I’ll hold it down for my peoples
Speakin' of God’s plan, don’t want to be God damned
Gotta pull it together, get dealt by thy hand
And with all this pain around the world I have only one endeavor
Another young man keeping his soul from getting severed
Yeah, people say that I should smile more
I reply dirty, like “Why for?”
Why for? Why Bother?
I already got friends: these demons in my closet
Check it out

This is for the kids rapping in the high stands
The up and coming artists feenin' for high demand
The folks that’d be dreamin' seeing it’s all grand
Young Simba conquering take back the what?

[Verse 2]
Mama forgive me for all the things that I’ve done
Baba forgive me for all the sins that are fun
I’d love to shed light, heed warning to my rising son (Sun)
But that would result in telling him all the things I’ve done
But the Son will rise and the day will come
When every other man is overshadowed by his throne
And people will chant, praying that the day will never come
That the greatness before them will up n' vanish, dead n' done
And to that I say two things that you would not object
Every soul will taste death and every sun will surely set
To my family, I’m blessed and to the fake people I’ve met
To the years of grinding and all the tears my mother’s wept
The courage and inspiration I’ve gained upon this road
Though the journey seems bleak, know that I’m never alone
Got God on my side, my supporters, my fam
Young Simba conquering take back the Pride Lands

[Hook 1]
[Outro]
Pride Lands
Pride Lands
Pride Lands
I told y'all I don’t rap, man
