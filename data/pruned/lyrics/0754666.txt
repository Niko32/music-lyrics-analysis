But now I'll tell you bout one all the southern folks have seen
She's the beauty of the southland listen to that whistle scream
It's that Pan American on her way to New Orleans

She leaves Cincinnati headin' down that Dixon Line
When she passes that Nashville Tower you can hear that whistle whine
Stick your hand right out the window and feel that southern breeze
You're on that Pan American on her way to New Orleans
[ dobro ]
If you're ever in the southland and want to see the scene
Just get yourself a ticket on that Pan American Queen
There's Louisville Nashville Montgomery the capitol of Alabam
You pass right through them all when you're New Orleans bound
[ harmonica ]
She leaves Cincinnati...You might also like
