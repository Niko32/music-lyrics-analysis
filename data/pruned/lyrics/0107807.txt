My Flow is hydro,so righteous,so nice
You can't possibly tell me nothing that could pertain to what I know
And I go,harder than most,hotter than toast
You might as well jump in the pot
I've already started to roast

[Verse 1:Shad Fer]
My Flow is so aquatic
Your flow is just so domo arigato mr.robotic
Don't attempt to test my knowledge
Yet they tempt my tolerance
Which is dumb as the thought of following
A rottweiler that's annoyed and
Isn't wearing a collar and
I'm hollering at college kids
That leave me unacknowledged when
I pop up on their monitors,momentarily anonymous
With the flow of a King Kong carnivorous cobra
Slowly slithering,visiting all the villages
I'm pillaging this game because I'm realer than the famous names
That you hear on your television screens
My ill agenda came through
Kill them and remain true
They complaining and debating cause I make them look like grade school
Students,I was thoughtful,I was prudent and I'm proving
I could be two or twenty-two and still gain the world's approval
They think rap's about to make a revolution
Feeling's mutual
I may be a mutant and unusual but...

[Verse 2:Duckie]
Somebody witness this flow that be ridiculous
Think he quick and shit,but still sicker than prescriptions is
A blunt will lift a kid
Bunch of unwritten shit
Check the arithmetic
Check how the rhythm kick
Shining like prisms bitch
Bars like prisons bitch
The bar is risen bit from bazaar shit I spit
The harder it gets,the more shit I spit
These soft niggas quit,I'm lost in this shit
Too much opinions given,when they lack the wisdom
Too much criticism,of that lyricism
They try to blur the vision of what I envision
Fuck these niggas,no matter what I'm winning
Not a fuck was given,what you take me for
They try to pull me down,but they make me soar
Like a medalist,been in this race before
That stupid flow,is what they hate me for
