Every time I feel alone
And slightly blue
That's when I begin to think
It's what I'd like to start to do
And though it may not be the kind of thing
That's quite your cup of tea
I recommend you pay attention
To the little dance you're gonna see

(Spoken)
I love pigeons and I love how they walk and I've created a really cool dance called...

(Sung)
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon
Dancing a little smidgeon of
The kind of ballet
Sweeps me away
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon
People may smile but
I don't mind
They'll never understand
The kind of fun I find
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon (I love it)
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon (It's me)
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon everyday

Oh boy is that exciting? Now, now I'll show you how to really do the dance good. Oh this is gonna be way out
Alright feet do your stuff
Dig this
Oh I'm grooving now

(Sung)
People may smile, but
I don't mind
They'll never understand
The kind of fun I find
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon
Doin' the (coo, coo) pigeon everyday
