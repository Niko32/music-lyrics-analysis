Riches do not come in silver and in gold
It comes in the happiness you find
I place my gold and silver before my precious queen
But now there's only memories left behind

[Chorus]
If you've ever lost a loved one
Then you'll know just what I mean
For what good are treasures and a kingdom
If you're a king without a queen

[Verse 2]
Now that she has gone and found another love
My castle is empty and so cold
For her leaving brought me heartaches that I have never known
And there's sadness in the treasures I now hold

[Chorus]
If you've ever lost a loved one
Then you'll know just what I mean
For what good are treasures and a kingdom
If you're a king without a queen
If you're a king without a queenYou might also like
