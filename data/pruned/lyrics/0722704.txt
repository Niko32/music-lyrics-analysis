There's a redhead from my hometown that loves to let her hair down
She tears my heart out when she starts to sing
She's from the right side of Red River and she's pretty as a picture
Don't you know she's this ole cowboy's dream
There's a boy from Okie City and I sure think he's pretty
But I know he's trying to steal my heart away
Oh my mama tried to warn me he's done time in California
But he'll be an Okie til his dyin' day

[Chorus:]
There's a dance we do in Oklahoma
A dance like you've never seen
Sit back and we're gonna show ya
How to do that Oklahoma swing

[Verse 2:]
Well when two Okies get together man
There's nothin' they like better
Than to hold each other on a sawdust floor
Oh I love it when we're swayin' to those sweet twin fiddles playin'
Come on boy what are we waitin' for

[Chorus][x2]You might also like
