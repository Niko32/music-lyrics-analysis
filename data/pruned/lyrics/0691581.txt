Sorry I lost it, something came over me
Is there a lesson somewhere in this awful tragedy?
You didn't deserve that, nobody does
Maybe we will make it, maybe not
Only time can tell you what you really got

[Chorus]
Time is all that can undo those things I said
I'm gonna have to wait 'till you forgive me in your head
Summer will come but winter's what I dread

[Verse 2]
Your disappointment isn't easy to bear
My mind is hard awaking up to find that you aren't there
Now that you've seen it, my demons revealed
Maybe we'll get better, maybe worse
Only time will tell us how much it really hurts

[Chorus]
Time is all that can undo those things I said
I'm gonna have to wait 'till you forgive me in your head
Summer will come but winter's what I â€“

[Bridge]
Dread to think I've thrown away the only love I ever had
Made a really stupid mistake, makes me really fuckin' mad
I wanna see you happy, hope it's me that makes you happy
But I know you need a minute or a month or a year
To forgive me
You might also like[Chorus]
Time is all that can undo those things I said
I'm gonna have to wait 'till you forgive me in your head
Summer will come but winter's what I dread

[Outro]
What I dread
What I dread (I want to see you happy, happy happy, happy, really really)
What I dread
What I dread (I want to see you happy, happy happy, happy, really really)
What I dread
What I dread (I want to see you happy, happy happy, happy, really really)
What I dread
