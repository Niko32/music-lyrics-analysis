You don't
You don't know who I be

[Verse 1]
Nowadays when I meet girls I'm afraid to tell em that I rap
‘cause nowadays when I meet em and I tell em that I rap, their eyes roll back
Then they get green
Ask me, chelly have you ever been in a magazine?
Ask me, you sure you rap ’cause you really look like you sing
Well I can sing a little song for you
Nevermind the front I'm putting on for you
Still got feelings for my ex girl but my ex girl got a phone full of phone numbers
And not a single one is mine
Never even noticed I was racing against time
‘cause I log on all in the middle of the night her facebook status is the one that I like
The first that I like
The first one that I like
You the first one that I liked ’til I loved to the point that I never thought twice
About us in danger
Whoever thought we'd ever find our love endangered, yeah
I said go to hell to an angel
Now we ain't nothing but strngrs


[Bridge 2]
Moving, moving, moving on
We keep moving on
You might also likeMove along, move along
I'm still all alone, all alone

Bring around the rosé
Bottle full of gold flakes
Ashes, ashes we all fall

Bring around the prozac
Pocket full of gold packs
Ashes, ashes we all high
