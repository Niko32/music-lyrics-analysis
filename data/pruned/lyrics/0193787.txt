[Godfather Don]

It's like some crazy shit..

Sir Menelik..
Peace to the other nigga..
Scaramanga Shallah..
Baby pa..
Lookin' fa' ya'll..

Come off, baby, give it to me..

[Verse 1: Scaramanga]

Identic temple
Hygienic mental
Aaliyah sauce, wit' a tart
Sparkin' proverbs
Lock words
Plot curves in the Universe
First fruits sermonic
Crease a fine feast
Curse the Greek beast
Trick talk, fear assault
From the city of the exalted
Understanding seven instructions of judgement integrity
Equity discretion
Lesson wisdom
Whirlwind pearl gem
World spin
Diligent militant hand that built the seven pillars
Will is balanced by the counselor
Crown of  twelve stars, Lazarus
Mountain of Avuh Rat
Parasite of the light
Who Solomon to James
Translate jewels to leave helmets in flame
The pentacost' ghost offended most
Even who don't believe in what they seein'
Debauchery, sorcery, torturey
Alpha Omega
Move through waters wit' me
In the Holy City come quickly
Butt of fire
The Star Of The Empire..

Star Of The Empire, ughn!
Star Of The Empire, ughn!
Star Of The Empire, ughn!
Star Of The Empire, ughn!

[Verse 2:Scaramanga]

The streets are pure gold
Transparent glass
No sun or moon
The Lord and the Lamb as the land
River of water's clear as crystal
Christ as the new life official
Finally, an issue I can grasp
The venomous ash doesn't represent medicine
6-6-6
A strange woman let you in to her blood stream of embalming fluid
Armor ruined
You start pursuing a cure
Insure this needle endure
Furious searchin' for a luxurious antidote
Salvation in a white envelope 'tenant coat rolled up
Bent on hen, no hope at the end
Doped up, coked up, choked up
With no friends, no ends, no wins
Just sold ya' Benz
Pop used to rock top non-stop
The fall slow and crawl low yo
His man with the LAND Lexus got busted in his solar plexus
For the rolex and the cuban link necklace
Sleepless these kids in New York is reckless
24 hour violence
We all affected boo by the iron rod god by the Star of the Empire
[Hook]

[Godfather Don]

Yeah.. Star Of The Empire, yeah, ughn!
Star Of The Empire, ughn!
Star Of The Empire, ughn, yeah!
Star Of The Empire, ughn, yeah!
Star Of The Empire, yeah, ughn!
Star Of The Empire, ughn, yeah!
Star Of The Empire..

[Verse 3: Scaramanga]

Now cool as a tiger or born to be a fighter
Or writer read it lead it don't need to heat it
Or teeth the gnash
Your brief to bash
To feed the crash
The curse MCs is wrathed
The worse disease is path
Peep the math - see the task of the Seraph
Connect chain like a crab blast
Arabs blast Palestine wit' nines
While we sip Ballentine's on Valentine's
A bloody heart
A muddy start when we part this lifetime and never recover
Discover another intellect
Reflect my section elegant angelic genesis protection
Calmness.. the bombness of the seven seas
Heavenly degrees of elevation
Pacify vibrations through 14 stations..
[Godfather Don]

“Yeah, what is it?”

[Scaramanga]

“Star of the Empire!”

[Hook]

[Godfather Don]

Yeah.. Star Of The Empire, yeah, ughn!
Star Of The Empire, ughn, yeah!
Star Of The Empire, ughn!
It's the Star Of The Empire, ughn, yeah!
Star Of The Empire..

[Outro]

[Scaramanga]

No doubt..
Scaramanga Shallah..
Hands of Pelonicus..
Word up, peace to Green..
Word up.. Peace to my man Kristoff..
All those locked down.. Hold ya' head..
We out in the field..
Word up, kid..
Path.. know what I mean?
Path.. to the math.. Drop this..

[Godfather Don]
