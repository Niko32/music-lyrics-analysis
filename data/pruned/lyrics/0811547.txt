Look at the options I have in front of me
There's a fork in the road, up ahead, which way will I go?
Up above to the wall worn track or the valley below?

[Chorus:]
There's one way I've got to go
Despite Everything I know

There's one way I've got to go

I wish I could take the easy way out of this
It's not ideal but I have to commit
I would take to the high road but there's no other way
Taking everything in my stride I fight through the fray

[Chorus x2]
There's one way I've got to go

[Chorus x3]
There's one way I've got to go (I've got to go)
I've got to go
I've got to goYou might also like
