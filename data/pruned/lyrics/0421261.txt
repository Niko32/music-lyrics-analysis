Fly away from here, I'll take you where you want to go
Far away from here, You name the place and then we'll go

[Verse: Jesse]
Thinking 'bout it now this life has turned out more than great
Slip on back to my soul just to find escape
Solitude is a nice place to be alone
Leave the world behind, purify your broken soul
If you really lost it all would it bother you?
To be able to feel the pain and not know the truth?
I'm here to write the words and just relay 'em on to you
Even if that means I have to live my life inside a booth
Young envoy, just another messenger
Trying to find my way so, can you please help me sir?
They say we feel alright, but its more like all alone
I can still talk with my God and we don't even use a phone
Where are we going? Where have we been?
I've started walking this road, so, let me begin
Lord help me tonight, cause I'm all on my own;
All I'm asking of you, is to guide me back home

[Hook: Jesse]
Fly away from here, I'll take you where you want to go
Far away from here, You name the place and then we'll go
