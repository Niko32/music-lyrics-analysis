When destiny calls, I trust in the feeling
You know well I've been here before
My feet on the floor
My head spinning round
Out of control, I reach for a lever
In the heat of the night, I'm pitched to a fever
You know well I''ve been here before
My feet on the floor
My head spinning round
Running for a reason
Run for a reason
Someone to hold onto
I change with the season
You know that I'm coming through
Like I always do
It's cold in the night, I hide in the corner
I keep up the fight, though I'm getting warmer
You know well I've been here before
My feet on the floor
My head spinning round
Running for a reason
Run for a reason
Someone to hold onto
I change with the season
You know that I'm coming through
Like I always do
Yeah, I'm coming through
Like I always do
Run for a reason
I run for a reason
Climbing the walls, touching the ceiling
When destiny calls, I trust in the feeling
You know well I've been here before
My feet on the floor
My head spinning round
Running for a reason
Running for a reason
Running for a reasonYou might also like
