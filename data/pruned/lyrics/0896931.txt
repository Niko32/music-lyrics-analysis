Jah Jah children is lifted on higher calling - calling
Never seen the righteous man be forsaken - forsaken
Neither does it see his seed beg your bread, your bread - no no
I and I are separated from the heathen
We always meet in one meditation, hey
Lick we cup and I chant to Jah
Giving thanks and praises unto the most high - most high
Jah guide, Jah bless and keep up
No evil doers shall overcome us, no
Blessed is I who behold a man in his fullness - fullness
So daughters of Israel come gather around us - around us
Learn the truth and rights of the wisdom - wisdom
Which is love and overstanding, yes
Love and overstanding..........You might also like
