All kinds of things I never did before
I thought she wasn’t comin home no more
But she called me up today
She told me how to gather up her stuff
She’s comin over later to pick it up
She borrowed her boyfriend’s pickup truck
But I’m gonna try to make her stay

[Chorus:]
My baby’s comin back today
I’m gonna try to make her stay
It’s ten o’clock now and I’ve got til four
When she comes walkin through that door
She’ll forget about him, she’ll want me more
I’m gonna try to make her stay
My cash is short and my credit’s low
I guess I’ll go to the goodwill store
To get a new suit of pre-owned clothes
I want to look my best today
Evidently I’m quite a slob
It’s a little late now to get that job
But I’d beg, I’d borrow, maybe even rob
If I could make her come back to stay
Chorus

When she told me she was leavin
I guess I did not quite believe
If she tells me now I’m dreamin
That’s when I’ll get down on my knees and say please
Just give me one more chance
To try to save our sweet romance
I’d even tell her I could learn to dance
I’m gonna try to make her stay
It’s ten o’clock now and I’ve got til four
When she comes walkin through that door
She’ll forget about him, she’ll want me more
I’m gonna try to make her stay
