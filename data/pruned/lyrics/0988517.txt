You came when I was happy in your sunshine
I grew to love you more each passing day
Before too long, I built my world around you
And I prayed you'd love enough of me to stay

[Chorus]
If you love me, let me know
If you don't then, let me go
I can't take another minute of the day without you in it
If you love me, let it be
If you don't, then set me free
Take these chains away that keep me loving you

[Bridge]
The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says "Hello, it's good to see you"
Anytime I turn around to find you there

[Verse]
It's this and so much more that makes me love you
What else can I do to make you see?
You know you have whatever is mine to give you
But a love affair for one can never be
You might also like[Chorus]
If you love me, let me know
If you don't then, let me go
I can't take another minute of the day without you in it
If you love me, let it be
If you don't, then set me free
Take the chains away that keep me loving you

[Outro]
Take the chains away that keep me loving you
