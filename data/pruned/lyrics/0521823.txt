Skin burned, my eyes hurt
And I always leave my curtains wide open
But the light never stays here, no the light never stays
Light never stays here, stays here, stays here
And I’m drinking cold coffee
And the cd in my car still plays in me
But the light never stays here, no the light never stays
Light never stays here, stays here, stays here

[Chorus: Denai Moore]
Tell me am I the only one
Getting lonelier, losing love in my heart

[Chorus: Denai Moore]
Tell me am I the only one
Getting lonelier, losing love in my heart

[Chorus: Denai Moore]
Tell me am I the only one
Getting lonelier, losing love in my heart

[Chorus: Denai Moore]
Tell me am I the only one
Getting lonelier, losing love in my heart

Sustain the noise out my window
And the wind fills all the places no one goes
But the light never stays here, no the light never stays
Light never stays here, stays here, stays here
I feel the time burn under my feet
And I can’t control the way my heart beats
The light never stays here, no the light never stays
Light never stays here, stays here, stays here

[Chorus: Denai Moore]
Tell me am I the only one
Getting lonelier, losing love in my heart

[Chorus: Denai Moore]
Tell me am I the only one
Getting lonelier, losing love in my heart

[Chorus: Denai Moore]
Tell me am I the only one
Getting lonelier, losing love in my heart

[Chorus: Denai Moore]
Tell me am I the only one
Getting lonelier, losing love in my heart
[Outro: Denai Moore]
I feel my heart go in my darkest hours, my darkest hours
I feel my heart go in my darkest hours, my darkest hours
It brings me to you
