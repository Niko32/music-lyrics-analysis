Is it everything you hoped for?*
Is it flawless, like the moon is tonight
Is it everything you’ve worked for
With the latest technology, with all we can achieve
Does your heart break as you fall through that snowstorm
Does your heart break as you fall through submarines, helicopters
And all the world’s adventures
To fight, to fight for your life
Will you fight, will you fight for your life
Cause will we talk about this game for years to come
Or will we talk about you, about you
Oh what might you do?
Is it every bit the sequel that you wished for
On your favourite star
Are you every bit the soldier that you know you are
In your secret heart
Are you in love with the countless weapons you will never touch
Are you in love with the feeling of living all the world’s adventures
Will you fight, will you fight for your life
Will you fight, will you fight for your life
Cause will we talk about this game for years to come
Or will we talk about you, about you
Oh what might you do?You might also like
