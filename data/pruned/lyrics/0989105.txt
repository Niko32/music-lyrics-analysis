Our captain takes command
He's drunken like a madman
The pilot sights the land
He slobbers like a toddler: "Full stream ahead"
The tanker runs aground the cliff
And thousand square miles are dead

Straight ahead
Straight ahead into disaster
Money talks
Bullshit's walking fast and faster
Straight ahead
Straight ahead into confusion
Money talks

He's hungry for adventure
He's longing for a kick
He saw these things on TV
And takes his hockey stick
Tonight he'll have his crime time
He walks the streets at night
Some people even saw the fight
But ran away to hide

Straight ahead
Straight ahead into disaster
Money talks
Bullshit's walking fast and faster
Straight ahead
Straight ahead into confusion
Money talks
You might also likeI'm fallin' fallin'
I hear them callin'
I'm fallin' fallin'
I hear them callin'

The mighty men of power
They meet on floor nineteen
They are the old white yuppies on dope
Their faces cruel and mean
They would stick at nothing
They merely hunt for cash
They play roulette with our lifes
For them we're only trash

Straight ahead
Straight ahead into disaster
Money talks
Bullshit's walking fast and faster
Straight ahead
Straight ahead into confusion
Money talks
