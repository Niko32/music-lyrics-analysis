Spinning the backsides bare
Praise be a little daisy
Who makes my bed of prayer

Fuss a little on the slave ship
She's arriving at the source
Talk trash about a liar
Who's day has run it's course

Don't take it from a mantra
Dusty music magazines
Just wait to see the french bull dog
Fly on the high trapeze

Hard to keep me unfriendly
Even providers get lost
Rock out you better log out
And save that pleasures cost

Hard to keep me fancy
Living as natural studs
Love to tie the leather harness
And suck thy neighbors blood

Don't take it from a mantra
Dusty music magazines
Just wait to see the french bull dog
Fly on the high trapeze
You might also likeHard to keep me hungry
Spinning the backsides bare
Praise be a little daisy
Who makes my bed of prayer
