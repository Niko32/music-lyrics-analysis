Where's the place where fade the stars
How should i know
How it feels to live in tide as last

How should i know
How it feels to dive in the sky
How should i know
How it feels to escape

I can't slip away.....

Just a wee bit to rest
Take my hand - let us twosome flee home
Seven tears
Melt away by your grace
How you sleep warm and safe
Please agree....

How should i know
That the cold would pass me by
And how shall i sleep
On a final lullabyYou might also like
