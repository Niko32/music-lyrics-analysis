Get in line against the wall
I've heard enough from your black tongue
Whichever way I turn around
I'm taunted by a voice on the ground
There's already miles to go
I've got nothing left here to hold
Got so many footsteps to go
Heavy from the burden that I chose

[Chorus]:
Hanging on a tightwire
Hanging on a tightwire
Tied up in this quiet trial
Hanging on a tightwire

[Verse 2]:
Keep your eyes on everyone
Two false moves, blink and it's gone
Nothing waits for you to start
No time to mend a fractured heart
It was over hours ago
There is nothing left to unfold
It was finished so long ago
Weighed down by the story I was told
