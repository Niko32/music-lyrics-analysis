Cashed my check
Send a mass text to all my rednecks
Party at my casa
Make sure you bring a lot of beer
Iced out coolers, fire in the pit
And if you don't show, you ain't worth dip spit
So you better come around cause you know it's going down out here

We can get a little crazy
But you ain't seen nothing yet
It's a night you won't remember
But a time you won't forget

Cause there ain't no party like a backyard party with me and all of my friends
Barbecue to the left, kegs to the right, everybody come on in
'Til you step through the door
Hit the dirt dance floor
Go on and pop a top
Cause there ain't no party like a backyard party
And a backyard party don't stop
Party don't stop

Gather 'round, Bubba's down for the count
IPhones out, YouTube bound
How many hits is he gonna get this year?
Bonfire's hot and the girls are blazing
Grace showed up, she's so amazing
And I can't wait for her date to disappear
You might also likeGo on and have a little fun
That you might regret
It's a night you won't remember
But a time you won't forget

Cause there ain't no party like a backyard party with me and all of my friends
Barbecue to the left, kegs to the right, everybody come on in
'Til you step through the door
Hit the dirt dance floor
Go on and pop a top
Cause there ain't no party like a backyard party
And a backyard party don't stop
Party don't stop

GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! GO! (continued under next four lines)

Backyard party
Back back back, backyard party don't stop
Backyard party
Back back back back, backyard party don't stop

Go on and have a little fun
That you might regret
It's a night you won't remember
But a time you won't forget
Well there ain't no party like a backyard party with me and all of my friends
Barbecue to the left, kegs to the right, everybody come on in!

Cause there ain't no party like a backyard party with me and all of my friends
Barbecue to the left, kegs to the right, everybody come on in
'Til you step through the door
Hit the dirt dance floor
Go on and pop a top
Cause there ain't no party like a backyard party
And a backyard party don't stop
Party don't stop
