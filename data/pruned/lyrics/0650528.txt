I've got a war inside my head
It's got to set your soul free
I've got a wheel inside my head
A wheel of understanding

[Chorus]
I'm a-loadin', loadin' my war machine
I'm contributing to the system
The breakdown scheme
I'm a-shuttin' down
I'm shuttin' down your greed for green
I am here to gun it down, now gun it down

[Verse 2]
I see little flowers at my feet
Cool breeze, clean air, hospitality
Pretty please, pretty please, pretty please
Get the hell away from me

[Chorus]
I'm a-loadin', loadin' my war machine
I'm contributing to the system
The breakdown scheme
I'm a-shuttin' down
I'm shuttin' down your greed for green
I am here to gun it down, now gun it down

I've got a war inside my head
It's got to set your soul free
I've got a wheel inside my head
Well, a wheel of understanding

[Chorus]
I'm a-loadin', loadin' my war machine
I'm contributing to the system
The breakdown scheme
I'm a-shuttin' down
I'm shuttin' down your greed for green, baby
I am here to gun it down, now gun it down
