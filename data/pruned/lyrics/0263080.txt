Infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio on
And how could anyone

[Verse 1]
You are in my dreams
Half human, half machine
You're with someone else that I have felt and seen
I cannot rest, or my consciousness contest
Looking right through the lens
From winter brings the spring again

[Chorus]
Infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio on

[Post-Chorus]
And we fall asleep again
With ties to mend
So please let the cleaning
Begin with evolution
You might also like[Bridge]
Hold my breath 'til communication
Is only just a test
Hold my breath 'til communication
Is only just a test
Hold my breath 'til communication
Is only just a test

You are in my dream
Half human, half machine
Looking right through the lens
From winter brings the spring again

[Chorus]
Infinite silence
Flowing right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio on

Infinite silence
Rolling right in with the dawn
This is wrong, this is wrong
And I cannot sleep without the radio
