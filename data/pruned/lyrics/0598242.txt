[Verse 1]
Everybody got a role i play mines well
See the bigger picture rest in peace to Big L
Dreams of success but am i getting better
Paint brush dry but the canvas getting wetter
And life is a bitch but i never disrespect her
Changing my ways but the money never do that
But the past niggas gon claim that they knew that
I wasn't gon stay the same
But face it like it novacane
You niggas funny but that's a shame
How you niggas stay the same and expect a change
I could of swore nigga that's was just called insane
But here i go here i go with these problems mane
You might also likePaid n Full really taught me well
That you can still win even if u face an L
Well Imma keep grinding till my time to go
So when i flow best believe that shit is gold
I'm in too deep just to stop now
And im still trying to live a better lifestyle
Someway and somehow
I believe i can make it out

Yeah
