Could've had it all, but instead you chose to bag up off it/
Shouldn't have gave me no breathing room, cause once I drop Im moving faster than Haley's Comet/
The beat, I stay up on it, your girl, she lay up on me/
All this southern hospitality, hard to believe that she's from california/
She a south beach baby, love her a nigga from the deep south lady/
Swag on anybody call they self hating/
She say, jeans off, scream shout, go deep baby/
Thats my type of female, more into real life than retail/
Got my mind racing, I'll buy anything that she sell/
Thick hips, slim waist, ex-pen-sive taste/
Running through my mind, thats the thrill of the chase/
Can't forget about that face, bad enough, make a gay nigga turn straight/
From head to toe, her outfit's a go/
From work to play, to department stores/
Every name brand's a game plan/
And I'm like her number one fan/
So while you strut and wear it out/
Ima stand here and clap and shout/
Every aisle's a style, she can pull it off/
When we hit the crib, she gone pull it off/
You know me, I do a lil more than ball/
I ask her why you only bought that/
You could've had it all/

Verse 2
She shut it down when she dressing up/
She in the club, something in her cup/
Them 4 inch heels was just enough/
And that dress she bought is hugging her/
Showing all the right curves/
I can tell she bad though my sight blurred/
I been pouring up and knocking them back/
Can't tell if I drove the dodge or the lac/
She said, "Once I start ain't no stopping that"/
So good, I put a lock on the cat/
I keep the key and know where she at/
So I dont need that treasure map/
Ima pirate in her caribbean/
The experience is serious/
Her sex game too mean/
Boy that thang is furious/
She got attitude, I show gratitude/
Cause something that bad/
Don't just happen dude/
No explanation, thats just nature/
And I thank the one that did create you/
Let me play a game on that frame/
I'ma throw this cash and you can keep the change/
Im rolling in too deep/
Bad enough to make me creep/
I'ma wish I never met her/
Cause when she gone, Im gone fiend/
She say "You know how we do"/
"So don't hesitate or stall"/
"You only got a piece"/
"When you could have had it all"/You might also like
