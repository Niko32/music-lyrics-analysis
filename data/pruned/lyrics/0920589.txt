She didn't know a single thing about the ways of my world
I was a lesson in doing wrong, she learned real fast
She went from Sunday school into Saturday nights
The girl next door into neon lights
School girl dresses into jeans that fit skin tight

She went from good to bad to worse to gone
And like a fool I thought she knew where she belonged
Everything I did she tried and it turned out wrong
She went from good to bad to worse to gone

I took her places she'd never been before
Now she don't need no help with them swingin' doors
Thought I was living fast in that passin' lane
'til she flew by like I was standin' still
With no hands on that steering wheel
Left tire tracks on this heart that she road killed

She went from good to bad to worse to gone
And like a fool I thought she knew where she belonged
Everything I did she tried and it turned out wrong
She went from good to bad to worse to gone
She went from good to bad to worse to goneYou might also like
