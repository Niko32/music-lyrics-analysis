Stoplight, lock the door
Don't look back
Undress in the dark
And hide from you, all of you

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never know the way your words have haunted me
I can't believe you'd ask these things of me (Ever and ever)
(Ever and ever) You don't know me
(Ever and ever) Now and ever

[Chorus]
"You belong to me
My snow white queen
There's nowhere to run
So let's just get it over
Soon, I know you'll see
You're just like me
Don't scream anymore, my love
'Cause all I want is you"

[Verse 2]
Wake up in a dream
Frozen fear
All your hands on me
I can't scream, I can't scream
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I can't escape the twisted way you think of me
I feel you in my dreams, and I don't sleep (ever and ever)
(Ever and ever) I don't sleep

[Chorus]
"Say you belong to me
My snow white queen
There's nowhere to run
So let's just get it over
Soon, I know you'll see
You're just like me
Don't scream anymore, my love
'Cause all I want is you"

[Bridge]
I can't save your life
Though nothing I bleed for is more tormenting
I'm losing my mind
And you just stand there, and stare as my world divides

[Chorus]
"You belong to me
My snow white queen
There's nowhere to run
So let's just get it over
Soon, I know you'll see
You're just like me
Don't scream anymore, my love
'Cause all I want is you"
[Outro]
All I want is you
All I want is you
All I want is you (Ever and ever)
(Ever and ever)
