I came in three days early
To meet my boat
It ain’t the life of Riley
But it’s keeping me afloat
It’s quiet over Christmas
If you got no place to go
I got my home from river rats
The only home I know

[Verse 2]
I found myself a flophouse
And I hit the streets at nine
Get some grub and drink a beer
Maybe go down the line
These chips will take your money
Shake a young man down
It’s the same in every one of these
Sorry river towns

[Chorus]
River towns, sorry river towns
River towns
River towns, sorry river towns
River towns
You might also like[Verse 3]
Well I picked me up a bottle
To take back to the room
Then I saw a young girl standing
In a doorway in the gloom
We’d hardly started talking
The old scenario
And I just let her work me over
Down by the Ohio

[Chorus]
River towns, sorry river towns
River towns
River towns, sorry river towns
River towns

[Verse 4]
When I asked her if she’d like to stay
She was down my stairs so quick
I never asked what got her started
With the sorry river tricks
So I get the bottle open
But something’s hit a nerve
And I’m looking in the mirror
At the face that I deserve
[Chorus]
River towns, sorry river towns
River towns
Oh, river towns, sorry river towns
River towns
