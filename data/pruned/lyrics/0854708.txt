Well, how were we to know what they would steal
We put our faith and trust in them
Not knowing they pretend to have the faith and trust in us to play

Then we met the dude
And he was interested in our strumming hands
So, he took his golden ear and made us platinum deal
To reach the top ya' all just have to pay
