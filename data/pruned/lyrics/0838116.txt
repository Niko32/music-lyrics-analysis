On Parliament Hill Fields fol the day
He saw her by the lido lie
On Parliament Hill Fields fol the day
He met her by the bandstand high
On Parliament Hill Fields fol the day

How time flies, so sick of goodbyes
I wish that I could stay
I lost my friends down loves dead ends
All lost along the way, lost along the way

Fair lady, lay your robes aside
On Parliament Hill Fields fol the day
No longer glory in your pride
On Parliament Hill Fields fol the day
But after the fair lady died
On Parliament Hill Fields fol the day

How time flies, so sick of goodbyes
I wish that I could stay
I lost my friends down loves dead ends
All lost along the way, lost along the way

"Write on my tomb" the lady cried
On Parliament Hill Fields fol the day
"His name is death and he resides
On Parliament Hill Fields fol the day"
