Up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up

[Verse 1]
I had to come through and let you know who it be
It's that -in -gga V-I-P-E
Viper, catchin' boys slippin'
Deep in the game while haters steady trippin'
While these boys suspect, droppin' mixtapes
I'm droppin' real albums like four drop grapes
What's up partner, you see a G on his grind?
I know you hatin', guess I'll drop the deuce one time
And I ain't even trippin' 'cause I'm deep in the game
Stars call me boyfriend, I done forgot they name
Got three right now, 'bout to hit one eight
Two hittin' unannounced, and one hittin' it late
And that's what I'm hittin'
And I'm patient 'cause of all the other dimes I'm splittin'
Superstars and models
That's when I roll, I don't mash the throttle

[Chorus]
Get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up

Ever seen a G
Stepped in the spot and have stars at his knees?
And you ain't know who it be
'Til you hit VIP, and seen it was V
-I-P-E-R
It's gravy, bein' a rap star
Especially when you one that knows how to ball
Except it's hard to find hoopers when you're dunkin' on 'em all
Cars lookin' for a spot, constantly on move
Gotta lean like the way you're movin' to the groove
Do it, baby girl, go and and work it for your boy
Let me get in the package like a brand new toy
I'm like a kid in a candy shop
With stars lookin' in for my lollipop
And when I step out
They runnin' up on me like I done got shot

[Chorus]
Get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up
Get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up
You a dime, get up
You fine, get up
