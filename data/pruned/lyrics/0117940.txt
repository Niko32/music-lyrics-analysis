We're just spinning leaves in the flight of a dawn, little girl
Falling through an eternal horizon of time
But as we lie here I'd like to think
That all we've got will be ours forever

[Chorus]
Don't you think we're forever
Don't you think we're forever

[Verse 2]
I can hear a voice on the wings of a dream, little girl
Melting me into love as it touches my heart
But sheltered in the distance of your sleep
Is all that I could love in a lifetime

[Chorus]
Don't you think we're forever
Don't you think we're forever

[Verse 3]
Open your eyes to the call of the winds, little girl
Can't you here them all saying I'll always be yours
Lying in the misty morning sun
The pillow of the night still beneath you
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't you think we're forever
Don't you think we're forever
