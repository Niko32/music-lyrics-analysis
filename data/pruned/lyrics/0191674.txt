Girl you were always my yellow rose and I was your one lone star
We always said together till death do us part
We had a love bigger than Texas, where is that feeling now?
It's taken some hits and losses
But it's fighting on and standing somehow

[Chorus]
Remember the man who asked for your hand
In the moonlight of San Antone
There by the mission you let your position be known
That you loved me so
Don't forget where it started
Remember the Alamo

[Verse 3]
I think we can hold on and make it together if we remember when
And get back to love the way that it was back then
When we were hopeless romantics needing each other, willing to take a chance
We strolled and we talked down the ol' river walk to the heart of where it began

[Chorus]
Remember the man who asked for your hand
In the moonlight of San Antone
There by the mission you let your position be known
That you loved me so
Don't forget where it started
Remember the AlamoYou might also like
