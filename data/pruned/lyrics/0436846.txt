Mmm
Before we get started
Are we all alone?
'Cause I'm about to get open-hearted
It's time to send your company home and turn off your cell phone
Baby, can't you see I just wanna get you satisfied?
(Satisfied)

[Verse 2]
This is gonna be a long night (Long)
A little bit longer afternoon (Afternoon)
Girl, if we get this thing right (Ooh)
Ooh, you gonna get satisfied real soon
(Can't you see) Baby, can't you see I'm just trying?
That I wanna get you satisfied?
(Satisfied)
Yeah

[Bridge]
I ain't talking about nothing physical
'Cause foreplay starts in the mind (In the mind)
I'm just tryin' to get you to think about doing things
That you've always wanted but could never find

[Verse 3]
I'm going to seek this thing like a buried treasure (Seek)
Like Columbus sailing over the sea (and destroy)
Till I discover, babe, the land beyond expertise and chastity, ooh yeah
I'm just trying, trying, I'm just trying to get you satisfied
(Satisfied)
(Satisfied)
Oooh, yeah
You might also like[Outro]
I'm sure you had another lover (Another lover)
Well, let me tell you, baby, all tricks aside
I can get you out of your body
Have you ever felt like you were dying and felt satisfied?
