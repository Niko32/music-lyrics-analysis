I remember you back in 1956
You had all the moves and you knew all the tricks
You left all the ladies in a hell of a fix
When your voice took wing
Then you'd shake around and oh, how you'd sing
Just an old boy from Memphis with a big diamond ring
A country girl's prayer and a city girl's dream
Hail the king

[Chorus]
But it's all right now
Keep on singing loud
It's all right now
Heaven should be proud

[Verse 2]
The fifties left town on a crowded dance floor
The sixties came in with a bang and a roar
The world heard a knock, it was Janis at the door
They let her in
And when it seemed this whole world was falling apart
The house lights would fall and the music would start
She'd be giving us all a piece of her heart
Once again
You might also like[Chorus]
But it's all right now
Keep on singing loud
It's all right now
Heaven should be proud

[Verse 3]
It was October in St. Louis town
When we heard that the Free Bird had fell to the ground
And we all said a prayer before we went down
To play
And Ronnie, my buddy above all the rest
I miss you the most and I loved you the best
And now that you're gone, I thank God I was blessed
Just to know you

[Chorus]
But it's all right now
Keep on singing loud
It's all right now
Heaven should be proud
