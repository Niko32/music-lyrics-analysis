[Bridge]
They don't hear me though (x4)


[Chorus]
Yayo I don't do no yayo
But I got a couple hundred pounds on the way though
Getting to the mula so we all about that payroll
This that time I say so
Better watch your Seiko
Yayo I don't move no yayo
But I got a couple hundred pounds on the way though
Getting to the mula so we all about that payroll
This that time I say so
Better watch your Seiko


[Verse 1]
Real talk no play dough
Run these circuits no bagel
Getting to this bread its all I said that ain't no fable
You might also likeWhat We Drop the label
Lay it out on the table
All about that payroll
All about that payroll

Getting to these pesos
Fiends shoot shit up like halo
They Hit you up you lay low
No I dont do no yayo

But they gon' do what I say so
Always willing and able
All cream no mayo
No I dont do move yayo

Shout out to them niggas that be on the grind
All about their figures money on they mind
Shout out to them bytches that be chasing dimes
Moving all that yay' ain't no wasting time
Out!


[Chorus]
Yayo I don't do no yayo
But I got a couple hundred pounds on the way though
Getting to the mula so we all about that payroll
This that time I say so
Better watch your Seiko
Yayo I don't move no yayo
But I got a couple hundred pounds on the way though
Getting to the mula so we all about that payroll
This that time I say so
Better watch your Seiko
