I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time
I felt it from the moment we met, you didn't ask me my sign
I love my daddy, but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day

[Verse 1]
You're a gentleman
And a gentleman is getting mighty hard to find these days
And you're a tender man
And you're man enough to show your love and tender ways

[Chorus]
I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time
I felt it from the moment we met, you didn't ask me my sign
I love my daddy, but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day

[Verse 2]
I love those silly things you do
You make me feel once more like an innocent child of two

[Chorus]
I really got the feeling that I'll love you for a long long time
I felt it from the moment we met, you didn't ask me my sign
I love my daddy, but it really don't matter what my daddy might say
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day
You might also like[Outro]
I really got the feeling, got the feeling
I really got the feeling, got the feeling
I really got the feeling that I'll love you 'til my dying day
