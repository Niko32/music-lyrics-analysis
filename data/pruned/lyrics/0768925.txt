I'ma drive you crazy
'Til you be my baby
'Cause you're giving me the signs
It's just a matter of time 'til you're mine
So you stay on my mind, 24/7 on my mind
And I keep reading into every one of your moves
Every little thing you do, thinking, should I pursue you?
Should I pursue you? Oh, darlin'

[Pre-Chorus]
So I start making plans
Take you out to slow dance
Light up a romance
Wrap your hands in my hands
Then I hold you
And we get closer
And I want you

[Chorus]
And I wanna drive you crazy, love
How can I just let go
If your eyes say yes, but you won't fall in love?
If I were a painter, you'd be my Mona Lisa
If I were a scientist, baby, I'd find the right chemistry
So you say yes to me, and I keep hanging on, hanging on
'Til you say yes to me, say yes to me, say yes
You might also like[Refrain]
I'ma drive you crazy
Til you be my baby
I'ma drive you crazy
'Til you be my baby

[Verse 2]
So I'm back in my room
Yesterday's ended too soon, way too soon
Staring at the canvas, watching the time pass by
I got all of my colors spread out around me
My glass of champagne is almost empty
Every stroke I make is a stroke on your body
Run my mind through your hair, it's only you I see

[Pre-Chorus]
So I start making plans
Take you out to slow dance
Light up a romance
Wrap your hands in my hands
And then I hold you
We get closer
And I want you

[Chorus]
And I'm gonna drive you crazy love
How can I just let go
If your eyes say yes, but you won't fall in love?
If I were a painter, you'd be my Mona Lisa
If I were a scientist, baby, I'd find the right chemistry
So you say yes to me, and I keep hanging on, hanging on
'Til you say yes to me, say yes to me, say yes
[Outro]
I'ma drive you crazy
'Til you be my baby
I'ma drive you crazy
'Til you be my baby
I'ma drive you crazy
'Til you be my baby
I'ma drive you crazy
'Til you be my baby
