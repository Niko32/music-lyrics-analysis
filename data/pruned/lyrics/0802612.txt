People dancing on a hill
Our song will reach across the valley
Take a day off from the mill

There'll be a high lit celebration
We'll string colored lights through pine
There'll be a party on the mountain
If you say that you'll be mine

Be a party on the mountain
Coleslaw, pickles, sweet and dill
And we'll roast ham and turkey
Make purchase from the still

There'll be red potato salad
Deviled eggs and custard pie
There'll be a party on the mountain
If you say that you'll be mine

The women clear the dishes
As the sun was goin' down
Then some ladies suggested
It was time to hit the town

No way
Jose
We'll stay
You might also likeAnd with the fire glowin'
With the music groovin'
It's too late for slowin' down

We'll party on the mountain
There'll be dancing on the hill
Our song will reach across the valley
Take a day off from the mill

There'll be a high lit celebration
We'll string colored lights through pine
There'll be a party on the mountain
If you say that you'll be mine

Be a party on the moutain
If you say that you'll be mine
