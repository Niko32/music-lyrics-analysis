Love is a powerful word
And you've been on my mind so much lately
How can I say this? Huh

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
I'm always late to dinner dates looking in her face
Marathon love making but she win the race
I live a certain life, it's hard for me to feel I'm safe
Tony Montana money, greet the guards at the gate
Greeks and gods on the lawn, on the estate
Versace couches, sandals, candles, and matching plates
This picture better than Basquiat's greatest endeavor
I'm kissing shorty in the rain but I'm making her wetter

[Verse 2: Chrisette Michele]
It beats every single time that I see
Your cell number showing up on my phone
It beats every single time that you're near me
I'm not ready yet, just leave me alone
I feel it deep in my veins, it's trying to say it's okay
But I ain't ready to go
Without my permission, my heart is all on a mission
It's got a mind of it's own

[Pre-Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
I say no and my heart just goes wit' it
No control, so I'm trying to flow wit' it
I'm so gone and it shouldn't have told me
Never should have told my heart I'm so

I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh (Yeah) in love
(Never should have told my heart)
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh in love
(And my heart is saying)
Boom boom clap clap boom boom boom
(And my heart is saying)
Boom boom clap clap boom boom boom
(I never should have told my heart)
I, I, I'm so (Yeah), oh, oh, oh (Yeah) in love
(Oh, so in love)

[Verse 3: Chrisette Michele]
Pitter, pitter, patter, patter
Everything is scatter scatter
Something is the matter with me
Boom like the radio, loud like a stereo
This is how my heart beats (Yeah yeah yeah yeah)
It's like a broke record, but I can't eject it
Feels like it's on repeat
I got new a confession, love's my new obsession
My heart's talking to me â€” it said: boom boom boom

[Pre-Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
I say no and my heart just goes wit' it
No control, so I'm trying to flow wit' it
I'm so gone and it shouldn't have told me
Never should have told my heart I'm so
[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh (Yeah) in love
(Never should have told my heart)
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh in love
(And my heart is saying)
Boom boom clap clap boom boom boom
(And my heart is saying)
Boom boom clap clap boom boom boom
(Never should have told my heart, yeah)
I, I, I'm so (Yeah), oh, oh, oh (Yeah) in love
(So in love)

[Verse 4: Rick Ross]
I'm chillin' courtside, Jordan six rings
You know we courtside 'til we get our six rings
We both on common ground, it ain't a big thing
But when we come around they make it a big thing
Still on the block in that drop chicken box
They asking "What that is?" "Is that a different watch?"
When I'm stunt mode, I gotta let the city watch
Or it's the clearport, jet to a chillin' spot

[Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh (Yeah) in love
(Never should have told my heart, yeah)
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh in love
(And my heart is saying)
Boom boom clap clap boom boom boom
(And my heart is saying)
Boom boom clap clap boom boom boom
(Never should have told my heart)
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh (Yeah) in love
(I'm so in love)
I, I, I'm so (Ooh), oh, oh, oh (Ooh) in love
(I'm so in love)
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh in love
(Never should have told my heart)
Boom boom clap clap boom boom boom
(And my heart is saying)
Boom boom clap clap boom boom boom
(I'm so in love)
I, I, I'm so, oh, oh, oh (Yeah) in love
[Outro: Chrisette Michele]
Never should have told me heart
Should have kept it from my heart
