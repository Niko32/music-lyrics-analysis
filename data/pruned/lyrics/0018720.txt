Been an done some shit
Been an done some shit quick
An Psyde gonna ride fo tha bloody money bitch
Why Psyde wanna pull it why?
So I grab Young Buk an them guys for real nik
Here goes the real deal
Cuz if I ride I'm a die fo y'all
I'm a drop on the shits clip
Ain't nuthin but max hits
So when we ride
It's S-U-A-V-E to the last tip
I done did some shit
That's why I gots to keep my ass outta this
Because I'm a nervous hit
I'm trapped in a padded roof
But did get to weap an theres no loot for it
An I gotta buy some bitch
Knew that's disasterous
Oh it's like the ass
An that's after
It's laughter an havok tricks
Respectfully niggas pull it, an we sick
Big ball an Psy
Wit Psyde I got
All I see is penitenteries
See all these demons big as pistols
Magnums
I'm so dispareless
Get down fo yo ground
Juss give me Young Buk an my raps
Nigga may slap me
My pockets gettin leathal an I
Gotta feed my kids
Wacky niggas fo my peoples

My niggas know what's up wit yo false
Where the fuck that fall?

Verse 2 *(Buk)*

I'd a been an done some shit
Cuz it's so many questions I ain't got answers fo
Maybe it's some shit I don't really need to know
So I juss chill
An keep my mind stuck on my own fuckin business
But these niggas here
They be all in my physics
Tryin to count my figgaz
Like what I done made
An who I done laid
What I done spoke
How many rocks, an how many blows
Lord knows
It don't stop
What if I popped yo knot an locked yo spot
Must have forgot
Who dropped yo boys off at that vacant lot
Yeah that's what I thought
Brought it on yoself, an pleed
An ain't gonna help nuthin
Shoulda let me let it slide
When I tried to let this shit slide
But I guess you said forget it
So I came to yo set an wet it
Wit Buk an Psyde gettin Buk on the side
Me screamin S-U-A-V-E
Don't fuckin play wit me
You'll fate'll be known
To the chrome
Leave me lone
I'm goin through hard times
An on the come up
You can keep them opinions to yo self
Because I'm shorty

Chorus

Verse 3 *(Young Buk)*

Let a mutha fucka do some shit
A young nigga do some shit
Shit can get fatal an hard like anvils
You know the man real
An on the stand still
Niggas get popped like can't feel
Then it's a damn thrill
To be Psycho Dramatical
Too much to han-deal
But it be certian mutha fuckaz that down me
Actin like they wanna get a man killed
Y'all don't wanna fuck around now do y'all?
I don't give a fuck about who call theyself
Been in shit
I been a hurt you like a U-Haul
Full 'o niggas wit blue ballz
An bitch
Leap at it
Idiotic ass tendacy
To be doin some shit
When a mutha fucka cross me like a crucifix
Lucifer gonna loosen it
That mean
Would you do that shit
An come back
Even more confusin bitch
If I come back before that shit
That's concrete wit yo shoes in it
An abusin fists
Gonna be distributed
Fo you hoes who calculated
An miscomputed
I'm in the booth gettin booted
Nigga got 18
Mutha fuck you seconds
Before who's ass die?
Shovin 2 mutha fuckin slugs into his shit
Juss to blow his high
Enterin angel spells
Born in anotha thang
You see the vein
When the pain repell it
An the brain reveals
Mouth mad like southern caine
An pain to kill
Chorus
