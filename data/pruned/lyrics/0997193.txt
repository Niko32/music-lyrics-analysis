There's always a way, there's always some free time
There's always a play, there's always a new guy
It's a home on a lake, I want to be clear
There's always a way and I don't want to be here

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll sue you, I'll sue you
I'm suing you
Yeah subterfuge

[Verse 2]
There's always a strain, there's always a beeline
There's always a play, I want the free ride
It's a home on a lake, I want to be clear
Nothing you will take with you, what will you leave here?

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll sue you, I'll sue you
I'll impugn you too

[Chorus]
What can I say?
You have everything that I want you for
You raised the stakes, that makes these feelings grow stronger
So what can I say? You were always my favorite
You paved the way, but I don't want to let you go
You might also like[Bridge]
I let go of myself and I am blown away
It's alright, I don't need this anyway
And then we'll fly away
And then we'll fly away
And then we'll fly away
And then we'll fly

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll sue you, I'll sue you
I'm suing you

[Verse 3]
She looks so much better on me
I'll take a ride in those sheets
I've looked inside, itâ€™s all peace
See I took your girl to see Jai Alai
Jai Alai

High alive
High alive

[Chorus]
You raised the stakes
And that makes these feelings grow stronger
So what can I say?
You have everything that I want you for
You made the way and I don't want to let you go
