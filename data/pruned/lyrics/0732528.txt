If I could only win your love
I'd make the most of everything
I'd proudly wear your wedding ring
My heart would never stray when we're away

[Chorus 2]
If I could only win your love
I'd give my all to make it live
You'll never know how much I'd give
If I could only win your love

[Verse 1]
Oh, how can I ever say
How I crave your love when you're gone away?
Oh, how can I ever show
How I burn inside when you hold me tight?

[Chorus 2]
If I could only win your love
I'd give my all to make it live
You'll never know how much I'd give
If I could only win your love

Oh, how can I ever say
How I crave your love when you're gone away?
Oh, how can I ever show
How I burn inside when you hold me tight?

[Chorus 2]
If I could only win your love
I'd give my all to make it live
You'll never know how much I'd give
If I could only win your love
