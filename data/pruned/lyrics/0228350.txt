He kisses her goodbye
And heads for the radio station
Oh, he hates to leave her
But he's got another show to do
He knows she gets lonely
So he lets her know that he's thinking about her
And though millions are listening
She knows who he's talking to
Chorus: (Sang)
Comin' to you live like I do every night
From the heart of your radio
I play a little sad, and I play a lotta glad
And a few ol' cheatin' songs
Here's hopin' everybody out in radio land
Found a love just as true as mine
Good night angel, sleep tight darlin'
Close your pretty brown eyes
When the show is over
Your radio lover
Will be home by your side
She's laying in bed
As her DJ tells her that he loves her
It would break his heart
If he knew she wasn't there alone
She knows when to cheat
And when to tell her lover to leave her
She knows they'll be safe
Just as long as his show goes on
(Spoken)
He planned a surprise
For the night of their first anniversary
He taped his show just so he could be home
The radio was playing and
As he walked in on her and her lover
He heard himself saying
The last words that they ever heard
Chorus: (Sang)
Comin' to you live like I do every night
From the heart of your radio
I play a little sad, and I play a lotta glad
And a few ol' cheatin' songs
Here's hopin' everybody out in radio land
Found a love just as true as mine
Good night angel, sleep tight darlin'
Close your pretty brown eyes
When the show is over
Your radio lover
Will be home by your side
Chorus: (Sang)
Comin' to you live like I do every night
From the heart of your radio
I play a little sad, and I play a lotta glad
And a few ol' cheatin' songs
Here's hopin' everybody out in radio land...You might also like
