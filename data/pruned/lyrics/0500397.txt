Come on along and listen to
The Lullaby of Broadway
The hip hooray and ballyhoo
The Lullaby of Broadway
The rumble of a subway train
The rattle of the taxis
The daffodils who entertain
At Angelo's and Maxi's

[Interlude: Tony Bennett, Tony Bennett & The Chicks]
When a Broadway baby said good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies didn't sleep tight
Until the dawn

[Chorus: Tony Bennett & The Chicks, Tony Bennett]
Good night, baby
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
Hey

[Refrain: Tony Bennett & The Chicks]
Come on along and listen to
The Lullaby of Broadway
Da-di-dop, di-dop, di-dop, di-dop
You might also like[Verse: The Chicks & Tony Bennett]
The band began to go to town
And everything groove hazy
You rock-a-bye your baby 'round
To Ellington and Basy

[Interlude: The Chicks & Tony Bennett]
When a Broadway baby said good night
It's early in the morning
Manhattan babies don't sleep tight
Until the dawn

[Outro: Both, The Chicks, Tony Bennett]
Good night, babies
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
But listen to the lullaby
Of old Broadway
Good night, babies
Good night, the milkman's on his way
Sleep tight, baby
Sleep tight, let's call it a day
But listen to the lullaby
Of old Broadway
Ah, da-do-do-bop
Ba-ba-ba-ba-bo-bay-bo-bo-ba-bo-da-do-ba (Ta)
Ba-da-da-bo-ba-da-ba
