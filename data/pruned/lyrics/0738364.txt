I'll be gone in the morning
Got my bags at the door this one last time
But while I'm here tonight
Let's pretend that we're still in love
Last time I'll be ignoring
All the things that you did to break my heart
I knew it from the start
We never could last but let me just ask for one last kiss
For you to..

[Chorus]
Touch me
Make me feel like I'm the only you want
Baby I want you to love me just like we used to love
Like I'm the only

[Verse 2]
Turn back time if you want to
It still won't change a thing I'm leaving you
Before I say we're through
Let's pretend that we're still in love
So will you..

[Chorus]
Touch me
Make me feel like I'm the only you want
Baby I want you to love me just like we used to love
Like I'm the only
You might also like[Bridge]
Put your arms around my body
And I'll forget the past for one more night
Since I decided to let go
I need you to pull me close
And baby..

[Chorus]
Touch me
Make me feel like I'm the only you want
Baby I want you to love me just like we used to love
Like I'm the only
Touch me
Make me feel like I'm the only you want
Baby I want you to love me just like we used to love
Like I'm the only

[Outro]
Touch me
I need you
I do
I need you
The only one
