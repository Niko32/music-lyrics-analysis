Oh, I recall some barroom brawls that I got myself into
Just a stitch or two got me back together
But what's it take to ease the ache
That came with losing you?
I thought I was tough but goodbye's too much
This healing is taking forever

[Chorus]
Woman, you sure got this old redneck feeling blue
What's going on inside me I'm not used to going through
This old country boy's hillbilly heart is breaking in two
Yeah, you sure got this old redneck feeling blue

[Verse 2]
I've never seen anything hit me quite like this
You know the pain and loneliness, they keep hanging with me
Oh, this good time Joe, he took quite a blow
Oh, why'd you call it quits?
It will take some time to mend my mind
And put me out of my misery

[Chorus]
Woman, you sure got this old redneck feeling blue
What's going on inside me I'm not used to going through
This old country boy's hillbilly heart is breaking in two
Yeah, you sure got this old redneck feeling blue
You might also likeWoman, you sure left this old redneck feeling blue
