Forget forgetfulness
You've made your way into my heart
Like a pulse running through my veins
I should never forget such vital things
Loathing you proved to be inadequate

[Refrain]
So I will love you in my sleep
And this will be less of a burden on me

Breath colors and feel alive
You mendacious little girl
You've crept onto the dance floor of a dangerous mind
And your pirouetting poison
As fresh as the air it destroys;
A familiar decoy
But I feel this is the only way to keep you
Is this the only way?
With a pillow in hell to rest my head
I am omitting the filial love I had for the original vision of you
I'll watch you grow into a woman

[Refrain]
And I will love you in my sleep
So this will be less of a burden on me
You might also like
[Outro]
Twisted hearts, like strings
Split and tangled
Leave thirst for serenity
Leading me to the only solution:
To kill the regimen
I will submerge my thoughts underwater
I'll show you a mind is less buoyant than a heart
