Everything once cast off I'm retrieving
Just to find I'm a born retriever
Golden to the core, silver pulleys and levers

Sore Barn Burners, don't judge us
I'd sooner just leave the crust
The plated pig wants to count our bless-yous
Could you count them and clean them, honey

Save yourself, strut your stuff
Cut the color commentary, trust your stats, man
Fishing for compliments and this is what I catch
Fuck, I'm never setting foot there again, no

Nothing good can come from leaving London
(Nothing good can come from leaving London)
Nothing good can come from leaving London
(Nothing good can come from leaving London)
Nothing good can come from leaving London
(Nothing good can come from leaving London)
Nothing good can come from leaving London
(Nothing good can come from leaving London)
Nothing good can come from leaving London
(Nothing)
