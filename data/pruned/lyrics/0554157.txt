I love, i love my dog
Yes I love, I love my dog
And I love, I love my dog

Going
Walkinâ€™ down babylon way
Gots to keep going straight
Got to love my lady love
Gots to keep going away

And I
Love my dog
Gots to keep it from going stray
And I
Love my dog
Gots to keep my PMA

And I love, I love my dog
And I love, I love my dog
Yes I love, I love my dog

And I
I love my dog
Got to keep it from going stray
And I
Love my dog
Gots to keep my PMA
