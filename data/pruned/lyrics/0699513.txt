What you doing?
You asleep?- wake up
Cuz I'm zoomin
What you mean what I mean wake up?
I'm trying get to it
And I'm almost at the exit that's almost at your exit
So close to your essence I feel you pulling
Can you intuit my intentions as I'm inching closer?
One glimpse of you will send me over
I'm mentally in you don't come
Out of bed yet
Nah, dont come out of bed yet
Let me into it
Let's have a meeting of minds, hearts, spirits
Bodies all blending
Recently I've been starving but I'm here
And its familiar and warm
Like visiting home
Grab a bite from your kitchen
You like when I nibble
Prior to entering the living room
Sit right in the middle
While I'm in here
I will still be the fiddler on
Your roof sunrise to sunset
Drink l'chaim to life-you're some catch
Hold tight cuz this isn't done yet
We finish up one set and mentally connect...
It's been too long, but I always says it's too long
You thinking what I'm--yeah you are
And that's ridiculous we complete each other's...

Hold on, here I come. I’m burning to something real
So close, I can feel you burning to something real

[Chorus: Marga Marion]
Could you wait up, I’m still on my way
Its been awhile since I have seen your face
When I make it back there you will know
All my heart is here for you to hold

[Verse 2: Marga Marion]
We’ve been here before, right here before
This isn’t the first or the last time, no
They say love is patient, they say love is kind
So love be kind and stay up now
Can you hear? I can hear the sirens calling you, calling me
So I’m asking

[Bridge]

[Chorus]
[Outro:]
I'm in love with You
And don't know what to Do
But looking in your eyes
I can see you love me Too
Things ain't always what they Seem
You're the woman of my Dreams
But when we get together
We stay up we never Sleep
