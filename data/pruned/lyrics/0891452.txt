I wanna break all regulations
Because we all go the same way
And we all pass the same stations

For just one day

No responsibilities, just everything is okay
No desires, just surviving is the key

For just one day
I wanna ignore our senseless fate
Colours are victorious over the grey
Stop to get controlled by the state
