I heard about love, but I'm not ready
I heard about trust and what you said, I believe
So, what about us?

It's already too much and it's only just found
There's no masking love
When you're pouring it out
When you can't get enough

[Chorus]
I will never leave you in the dark
Gave you the center of my heart
The only one who shines a light on me
If you're leaving for somewhere
No matter what you do, I will be with you, ooh
Like a sinking ship out there
I will get to you, before I go sinking too

[Verse 2]
I'm running out of places that I can hide in
Why should we care what they say?
Do you know how it feels?
You don't know much

[Chorus]
I will never leave you in the dark
Gave you the center of my heart
The only one who shines a light on me
If you're leaving for somewhere
No matter what you do, I will be with you, ooh
Like a sinking ship out there
I will get to you, before I go sinking too, ooh
You might also like[Outro]
If you're leaving for somewhere
No matter what you do, I will be with you, ooh
Like a sinking ship out there
I will get to you, before I go sinking too
