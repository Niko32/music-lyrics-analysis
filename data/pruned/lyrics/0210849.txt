Drink some water, replenish my body
Gotta admit, last night, I fucked that party in the asshole
That's how it goes
And then after I left, I heard that shit was a fiasco
'Cause Chank Smith bring 'em out
Not them barrels, but them bitches that go south
On my dick and my dingaling
Touch the balls with your tongue, bitch, ooh
Yeah, uh, yo, I feelin' this shit, Green
Unlike a paraplegic could feel his jeans
Sunny choppin' shit, fitted hat, all black on
I love bitches when they titties stack my max on
I don't trust women, I do trust sluts
Madonna whore complex syndrome, my mom was nuts
"Chank Smith, Chank Smith, ain't that Colin Hanks, bitch?"
Yeah, but she with me now 'cause I'm the life of the party

[Chorus]
I'm on my Anne Heche shit, I'm life of the party
I walk in the room and I'm fucking everybody
Only girls though, not dudes, I'm not gay
Anne Heche, she fucked girls
That's why they call me that name
I'm on my Anne Heche shit, I'm life of the party
I walk in the room and I'm fucking everybody
Only girls though, not dudes, I'm not gay
Anne Heche, she fucked girls
That's why they call me that name

This party is for adults, ha, no kids
But kind of ironic 'cause we about to start making some right now
But kids shouldn't have sex, that's my PSA
Your shorty felt me up like she was TSA
Yeah, I got a big package and I got to check it
You know what I mean? Yeah, you know what I mean
So anyways, where's your girl Atlas? Get involved
Let's have fun now and let's party, y'all
Damn, girl, you make parts of my body hard
But your body in trouble, need a bodyguard?
Maybe if it's a chick 'cause I don't let dudes watch me
Because then they might steal my mousse and try to copy
I got the swoop down, move, shh, don't tell
Anybody, that's my move bro
One dude creeped through the doorway and stole it
Fucked a girl and she screamed out, "Anne Heche"

[Chorus]
I'm on my Anne Heche shit, I'm life of the party
I walk in the room and I'm fucking everybody
Only girls though, not dudes, I'm not gay
Anne Heche, she fucked girls
That's why they call me that name
I'm on my Anne Heche shit, I'm life of the party
I walk in the room and I'm fucking everybody
Only girls though, not dudes, I'm not gay
Anne Heche, she fucked girls
That's why they call me that name
[Outro]
That's a two minute song, man, play that shit again
