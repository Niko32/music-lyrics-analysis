Along with my rattle and pen
I nursed them for a while
Or until I couldn't pretend

All auctions start with tears
It's bankrupt but regret
Is the love of what's gone wrong
When love is meaningless

Into the sourdays
Like lemon mixed with piss
Long before you realised that you'd lost your way
You had already swallowed it

In all that you're confined
None resemble you
I don't resent your luck
But I suspect you do

The flowerpot that's cracked
On the step to your front door
Well that's my wish for you
To be thirsty and barely hold water

Into the sourdays
Like lemon mixed with piss
Long before you realised that you'd lost your way
You had already swallowed it

While we're driving through these hills
Between our heads will be the sound
Where sunlight never spilled
