Welcome to Love City: population two

[Verse 1]
It isn't a big place, our little town
But it's filled with lovely sights all around
A park filled with flowers, a beautiful lawn
The streets are the driveway that leads to our home
Just a small house on an acre of ground
We call it Love City, our little town

[Chorus]
Welcome to Love City: population two
Founded on a little love that just grew and grew
Between me and you

[Verse 2]
We built our home on love's avenue
The taxes are low and it has a nice view
We've got home cooked meals that are fit for a king
And all kinds of love to fill every dream
A room just for friends if they happen to
Visit our Love City: population two

[Chorus]
Welcome to Love City: population two
Founded on a little love that just grew and grew
