One, two, three

[Verse 1]
I bit my tongue and stood in line
With not much to believe in
I bought into what I was sold
And ended up with nothin'

[Chorus]
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea

[Verse 2]
You thought that I would never see
What was meant for you was meant for me
I was distracted at the time
Forget about yours, now what about mine?

[Chorus]
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea

[Verse 3]
You thought I was a little girl
You thought I was a little mouse
You thought you'd take me by surprise
Now I'm here, burnin' down your house

[Chorus]
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea of a good time
This is not my idea
[Live Ad-lib 1]
Oh you've got blue eyes
Oh you've grey eyes
Oh you've got green eyes
Oh you've got blue eyes
Oh you've grey eyes
Oh you've got green eyes

[Live Ad-lib 2]
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright now
Everything's gonna be alright now
