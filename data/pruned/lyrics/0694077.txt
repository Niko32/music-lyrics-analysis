When my morning comes around, no one else will be there
So I won't have to worry about what I'm supposed to say
And I alone will know that I've climbed the great big mountain
And that's all that will matter when my morning comes around

[Verse]
When my morning comes around, I will look back on this valley
At these sidewalks and alleys where I've lingered so long
And this place where I now live, it'll burn to ash and cinder
Like some ghost, I won't remember when my morning comes around

[Verse]
When my morning comes around, from a new cup I'll be drinking
And for once I won't be thinking that there's something wrong with me
And I'll wake up and find that my faults have been forgiven
And that's when I'll start living, when my morning comes around

[Outro]
My morning comes around
My morning comes around
When my morning comes around
I know my morning comes
I know my morning will come aroundYou might also like
