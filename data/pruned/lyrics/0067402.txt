Every day the deficit grows
You spend more than you own
Papa always said to me
"Keep a close eye on your authority"

[Chorus]
'Cause you say that you cared
And I was unaware
You say that you cared
And I was unaware

[Hook]
All you do is push, pull, tear
We can't stretch it any farther
Push, pull, tear
We can't stretch it any farther

[Verse 2]
Every day taxes increase
So is this our land or is this our lease?
Papa says "Son, it's the land of the free"
As he broke his back trying to make ends meet

[Chorus]
You say that you cared
And I was unaware
You say that you cared
And I was unaware
You might also like[Hook]
All you do is push, pull, tear
We can't stretch it any farther
Push, pull, tear
We can't stretch it any farther
Push, pull, tear
We can't stretch it any farther
Push, pull, tear

[Chorus]
'Cause you say that you cared
And I was unaware
You say that you cared
And I was unaware

[Hook]
'Cause all you do is push, pull, tear
'Cause all you do is push, pull, tear
Push, pull, tear
We can't stretch it any farther
Push, pull, tear
No, no, we can't stretch it any farther
Push, pull, tear
We can't stretch it any farther
We can't stretch it any farther
Push, pull, tear
We can't stretch it any farther, no, no
