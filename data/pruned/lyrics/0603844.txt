She wanna leave drunk with me tonight
And pop bottles for the rest of her life, x2

[Verse 1: Rob Flo]
We can leave when the lights on
When the drinks stop coming see the sun and all the ice gone
Python money treat the cabby like a flight home
IPhone buzzin but I cut it like a knife on
You
I never met before
If it goes right honey will ya let me score
I got your nose right on it gonna let ya snort
Ya wanna blow snow white I know the seven dorf’s so
Can you metamorph out them denim shorts
Send them to the floor like they were headed straight for the court
She headed straight for the bores
I bent her over the Porsche
I hop in that pussy poppin I got her like kettle corn

[Bridge]
She don’t wanna fall in love
She’s my alcoholic drug
Lay loose, grey goose, in the tub
She don’t wanna fall in love
She’s my alcoholic drug
Lay loose, grey goose, so lets fuck

She wanna leave drunk with me tonight
And pop bottles for the rest of her life, x4

[Bridge]
She don’t wanna fall in love
She’s my alcoholic drug
Lay loose, grey goose, in the tub
She don’t wanna fall in love
She’s my alcoholic drug
Lay loose, grey goose, so lets fuck

[Verse 2: Vonte]
I like drugs
Said she wanna pop bottles
Then fuck her full throttle
And I don’t give a fuck unless you lookin like a model
Body hella tight, lookin like a fuckin coke bottle
Okay now
Let see something, baby stop playing
We sloppy drunk, I make it hot like I’m ?
Phone on silent but she yellin out my name
Mad scientist so she give me hella brain
I’m insane and she know that
She on top riding like its horse back
Throwin shots back don’t chase that
Smokin on the pack don’t face that
Got up, nose down, then I take that
Straight like that, haha
[Bridge]
She don’t wanna fall in love
She’s my alcoholic drug
Lay loose, grey goose, in the tub
She don’t wanna fall in love
She’s my alcoholic drug
Lay loose, grey goose, so lets fuck

[Chorus]
She wanna leave drunk with me tonight
And pop bottles for the rest of her life, x4

[Bridge]
She don’t wanna fall in love
She’s my alcoholic drug
Lay loose, grey goose, in the tub
She don’t wanna fall in love
She’s my alcoholic drug
Lay loose, grey goose, so lets fuck
