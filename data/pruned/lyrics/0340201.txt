Ope, fuck
Gimmie a second...

[Verse 1: MTFR]
I'm to turnt up for these bitches
Bet you niggas wish you was me
Man her head game so vicious
Made one tongue feel like it's three
But all these hoes can't help me succeed
Still ain't shit I'm just one year deep
I couldn't stop the shit if I tried boy this music shit that I bleed
Now what that mean?
Yeah i'm mad nigga
Damn right I'm a bad nigga
My pops don't even know I rap so fuck you and yo dad nigga
All these hoes just tryna boost my head they tell me I'm next up nigga
But I hate that fuckin phrase almost as much as I hate fuck niggas
I'm movin' and workin'
My hands are still hurtin'
From bars that I'm typin'
My hands need some Jergens
Yo hands get to jerkin'
You lonely ass nigga
That porn site you searchin'
I'm on it my nigga
Search yellow bitch with a rapper
My face might pop up
Hit dark skin ho with a pretty nigga
That's me again right after

My team heavy like straw hats kill em off with that chopper
Pirate all in that bay they might call me Jolly Roger
Nico Robin all in my shirt she with Nami so don't bother
See my haki on a hundred so bow down to your father
Oh no, Oh no
I'm with Yoko Ono
Smokin' on that chrono
Neva solo
If you try me don't know
Where your body's gunna go
So you can find me somewhere deep in Grand Kyoto
No kimono
Got her wishin' for my Domo, Roronoa Zoro
Three strikes and you out bitch
Fuck you and your outfit
I don't give a ho attention unless her titties mountains
G.H.S I'm never slackin' bet imma put in that work
Tell your gingerbread bitch she gon' have to catch me first
