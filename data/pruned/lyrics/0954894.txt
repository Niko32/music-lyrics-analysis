I don't have you for Christmas
Silent night, lonely night
I don't have you this year

But I'll have twelve long months to remember
And I'll have twelve long months to forget
And I've had a few lonely parties
But this is the loneliest yet

Silent night, lonely night
I won't have you this year

There are twelve long months to remember
And twelve long months to forget
And I've had a few lonely parties
But this is the loneliest yet

Silent night, lonely night
I won't have you this yearYou might also like
