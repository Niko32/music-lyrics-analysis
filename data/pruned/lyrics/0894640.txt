I can't help it, I'm a romantic fool
It's a habit of mine to watch the sun go down
On Echo Beach, I watch the sun go down

Echo Beach, far away in time
Echo Beach, far away in time

On silent summer evenings, the sky's alive with light
Buildings in the distance, surrealistic sight
On Echo Beach, waves make the only sound
On Echo Beach, there's not a soul around

From nine to five, I have to spend my time at work
My job is very boring, I'm an office clerk
The only thing that helps me pass the time away
Is knowing I'll be back at Echo Beach someday

Echo Beach, far away in time
Echo Beach, far away in time
Echo Beach, far away in time
Echo Beach, far away in time
Echo Beach, far away in time

It's a habit of mine
