Teach us tonight, because we're searching for the sun
You are the reason, though our world has come undone
Don't hide away, you are the reason we are here
We need you with us, and to guide us again without fear
You are the reason, you are the reason


[verse 1: soul frenzy]
Its sick but who could ever predict
Its save in that game weve played
But you are not a slut
Thats the reason im a mutt
Cause i love you more
You won't escape me whore
Dont you try to make sore
You left me
You throw me out the house
I throw you out the house
But the sex is to damn good
I throw you down on the couch
I punch you in the mouth
Fight til we turn this mother out
Where is this all about
Im living at the south
You are the reason for me
You are the reason for evryone
But im not probably done
We haven't won
Im not your son
Dont try to be the boss over me
Why dont you see it ?
Then just so be it
I can't sleep anymore in this home im living
Rest in peace

[verse 2: soul frenzy]
Cause i love you
Im right above you
You left me to day
Do you hate me?
Thats why you said you never date me
But please waith me
Im so fcking angry
But baby it isnt your fault
But at least we know
That we share this common bond
You're the only one I can fuck without a condom on
They are the only one who i can throw a fcking bom on
You are my motherfcking hon
But you know that we haven't won
You dont have a son
Im living right under the sun
Im shooting evry man with a gun
Because i know that is fun
I will leave this motherfcking place
Be right now to say farewell forever to me
So bye
I hope you dont die

Looking through the eyes of love, you know the world may seem a better place
And yet the moment that you realize, there's so much pain before your very eyes

Bridge 2 :pimp knuckles
But im now own your fucking life
But what do you if you
Just losing your life
Then im owning this place
Wasted your own fucking time
Man i just do this without a reason
Cause im gonna kill you
But everybody knows you
Everybody miss you
Everybody hate you cause you murdered yourself
Doing without a reason
