I got my money in my pocket
I got my guitar in my hand
I got my copy of Das Kapital
I'm gonna go down to the library and read it

[Verse 2]
I got my needle and my syringe
I got my freedom from the world
I'm gonna kill my mum and dad
And then I want to get into real estate

[Chorus]
Anarchy
Anarchy

[Verse 3]
Yee-hah! Well, music is my ticket to freedom
Rock is my passport out of here
I'd rather wear a shirt and collar, yeah
And get fat drinking beer
Here we go

[Chorus]
Anarchy
Anarchy
Anarchy (Anarchy means crossing when it says 'Don't walk')
Anarchy
