Not a stinker on it
I feel like I've never done anything good
I said, "fallow times are times too"
Steve said, "I feel infinity bad...times two"
If I could have made something good, I would have by now

So I emailed Rick
Said "Do you wanna play with us some time?"
And he emailed me back
Said "Man our summer's looking pretty busy"
I said "that's cool,man"
Busy is a good problem to have
I said that's cool, man, I'll catch you later"You might also like
