Between me and you, I've been set up. I'm a patsy, It was so dirty
Fingerprints and DNA we're in for it, guilty for being an easy sucker
I dont want to kill her, but I gotta, cause i've been hired
So say goodbye to her
Tape over the mouth, arms tied to legs and her chair begins to shake, as she realizes her fate

Oh no, its not what you think
I've never done this before
But every single breath I breathe knocks me straight to the floor
This time, I'm coming down with more

Her voice is like the sunlight, breakin' the night, she's erasing my mind
I have no strength, she can put me in her arms with the blink of her eyes
Which are golden and have me tranquilized, I'm seeing double, and I like both sides
Why do I do this everytime

Our hands are like a radiotor, this is one cold winter
Burning up and the rattling kicks
The little hairs on my neck stand sooooo tall
She blossoms like the colors of the leaves in the fall
Wait, take two steps back dont let her whispers attach
She's got a way of misdirecting, everythingYou might also like
