When we failed to share a life, but tried
I think we lost perfection somewhere
Where I wouldn't dare to look again

For once drink with me tonight

Let's not waste another second
Let's wash down the years
And savor this coming night
Until the call of light

Pour the wine and let us drink
The pleasure we never dared to treasure
That stinging nostalgia
Indefinable memory
Locked away

For once drink with me tonight

What I see, what I hear
This scented sentiment
Had to come from somewhere
All I can do is try
For words to tell you why
I can't let go
All you can do is try
To remember why I
Can't just lock it all awayYou might also like
