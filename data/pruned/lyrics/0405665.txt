I know you're trying to protect me
Searching for another truth
With your language and your poetry
From my ignorance and youth
Hey i did not come to argue
My life never made much sense
I just wish that i could hug you
You're my only defense
I don't understand your writing
I could barely sign my name
All i ever learned was fighting
But i'm not the only one to blame
The streets were dark with danger
I have to stand up for my friends
In a land where i'm a stranger
And the hatred never ends
