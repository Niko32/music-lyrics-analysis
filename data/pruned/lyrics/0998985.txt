I wonder what could be his name
He looks good to me, and all I can see
Is his fine brown frame

How long have you been around?
Mister, when did you hit this big town?
I wanna scream, 'cause I've never seen
Such a fine brown frame

All that I have is a broken down chair
But I would gladly make him king on my throne
Don't be a square, why don't you come over here?
Together we would really be gold

Woah
He's got a fine brown frame
I wonder what could be his name
He is solid with me, and all I can see
Is his fine brown frame

Be be be be beep

He's got such a fine brown frame
I wonder what could be his name
He looks good to me, and all I can see
Is his fine brown frame

But I would gladly make him king on my throne
Don't be a square, why don't you come over here?
Together we would really be gone

Ooh, he's such a fine brown frame
Honey, won't you tell me your name?
He is solid with me and all I can see

Now Robert Taylor, Robert Young, Ameche and Gable
Are all as fine as mountain sable
You may not be classed with the elite
And you may not be hip to that jive-like foot, an' all reet

Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah baby you
You look like Hercules done up in bronze
And I know I'm a clown whenever you're around
Because I'm crazy 'bout, mad about, wild about
Your fine brown frame
