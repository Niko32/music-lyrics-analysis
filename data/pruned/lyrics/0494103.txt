Just wanna remain unnamed, my sharpness is dulling/
People just take and take, never pulling their punches/
You were my greatest gain, my love was so earnest/
My insides decay decay, now I gotta keep running/
Couldn't escape unscathed, these scars got me clutching/
My chest, gotta break away, demons say they'll be punished/
Ask me to explain explain, I won't tell you nothing/
Here's what the tapes contain, a silohette plunging/
Took my brain and weighed, climbed the building said fuck it/
Blood stained fatal plains, feels like my head is just gushing/
Stood up, came to strange, and walked away stumbling/
Just need you to stay away, these feelings are puzzling/
Still love you but major pain, this monster is yearning/
To pull your heart out, and show you what you did to mine/
To make you feel this pain and realize that you're still alive/

Listen to me honestly, I can promise you nothing/
I just wanna save today, but these horses are bucking/
Can't get out, to get away I just started running/
I don't know what caused this but more problems are coming/ x2

You took my son away, then acted like it was nothing/
And now I must escape, this fucking maze before it rushes/
I don't have much to say, just understand that I'm struggling/
We coulda seen the money game, and now you're just thumbing/
Your nose on another date, all of this pain is just numbing/
Me, I'm the one to blame, all this blood is just rushing/
See, I'm gonna fucking faint, you call this shit justice/
Please, notice the conundrum faced, how I'm getting punished/
These assholes took my gun away, and this weight is just crushing/
Me, These words must convey, when I'm trying to say something/
I'm done playing fucking games, I'm done with all the bluffing/
Sit high while I fucking chase, I'm tired of the chuckling/
Just need you to stay away, these feelings are puzzling/
Still love you but major pain, this monster is yearning/
To pull your heart out, and show you what you did to mine/
To make you feel this pain and realize that you're still alive/

That was the day my hope died, gave in to the monster/
He made my eyes go blind, all I could think was just constant/
Anger, why oh why, now I'll end up just like my father/
Let life roll by, passed out bottle after bottle/
Never high profile, just more baby mama drama/
Living behind closed blinds, my outlook always getting darker/
With my own nightmares, thought I would never ever falter/
Bottle of right old wine, down it to forget all my problems/
I'll never find those lights until I can make myself stronger/
But I might go wild, a fear I'll carry as a scholar/
Hit every milestone like, will I actually make good on my promise/
Blow up like dynomite, or just get forever softer/
Just need you to stay away, these feelings are puzzling/
Still love you but major pain, this monster is yearning/
To pull your heart out, and show you what you did to mine/
To make you feel this pain and realize that you're still alive/
