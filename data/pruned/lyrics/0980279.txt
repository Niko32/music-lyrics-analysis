Listen to my jingle jangle and I'll tell you what I'm thinking of
I'll tell you what I'm thinking of

Now this boy and girl were so happy
As happy as they could be until the time he had to leave her
Then began their misery
Then began their misery

All through the days and nights she waits for him, waits for him
Hoping that some day he will return to her
Other boys said that she wouldn't wait for him, wait for him
And if she did her heart would surely burn

Listen to my jingle jangle about a boy and girl in love
Listen to my jingle jangle and I'll tell you what I'm thinking of
Tell you what I'm thinking ofYou might also like
