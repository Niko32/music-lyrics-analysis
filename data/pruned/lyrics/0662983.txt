Have you ever loved someone you knew nothing of
Except you'd seen the light inside their eyes
Have you ever loved someone just because
Nothing felt so easy or so right

And I think of you like the others do
Wondering if you think of me
And if you do, if you really do
Who is it that you see

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved
Whether right or wrong
Have you ever loved someone
Just because

[Verse 2]
Have you ever tried to speak the truth instead of lie
When it seemed you had everything to lose
Have you ever tried to stand your ground instead of hide
When staying only made you look a fool

And I stayed by you though I think I knew
It wouldn't change a thing
Changes come to hearts with ease
But they come so hard to me
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Have you ever tried
To make it last not knowing why
Except you had to try
Just because

[Verse 3]
And every day that passes now
I suppose I'm getting older
Wiser with the things I've done
But I hope I don't grow colder
And now I see the ones, who've lost so much
They swear they're done
With love and all the chance it brings for pain
But have you ever touched, and by itself it was enough
To make you want to reach out once again

[Bridge]
And I'll touch you when I need a friend
Or just a small reminder
That I haven't grown too cold to feel
You penetrate my armour

[Chorus]
Have you ever loved
Whether right or wrong
Have you ever loved someone
Just because
[Outro]
Have you ever loved someone
Just because
