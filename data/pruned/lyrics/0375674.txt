I keep it '91
Like telephone tag with landlines
I'll make your whole fam hopscotch on a land mine
Psychiatrists dude, think I'm oh so sick
You couldn't crush my fucking hope with a two ton brick
And fuck Buddha, I'm blowing mucus
And you could be my Judas, cross me
Justified to a T
Leave me a cross feed
I'm awfully sorry for the things I say
So grab your daddy's 38 and straight
Blow me away
I got a mac in it
Vernacular, what's crackalackin'?
Crack your back into an acid aftermath
That ain't as spectacular as me
I know I got an ego like the Romans
And you emo like you Holden
And I'm lethal like I'm holding
Oh Lord, God bless my style
And you're fin to get laid on Cheshire Cat smile
I'm rearranging the tiles
My mosaic is wild
So versatile that I lose sight of myself for a while
