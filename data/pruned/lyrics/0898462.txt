She'll never grace the centerfold of Playboy magazine
And chances are you'll never see her on the silver screen
She's by far the biggest star the world will never see
But she don't shine for the rest of the world
She's too busy shinin' on me

[Chorus]
Shine on, shine on
Shine on though the world may never see
Oh, my baby won't you shine on, shine on
Shine all your sweet love on me

[Verse 2]
She won't be asked for autographs like all the movie stars
She won't wear Paris fashions or ride in chauffeured cars
But in her jeans, she's the sexy dream that they'd all like to be
But she don't shine for the rest of the world
She's too busy shinin' on me

[Chorus]
Shine on, shine on
Shine on though the world may never see
Oh, my baby won't you shine on, shine on
Shine all your sweet love on me
Shine all your sweet love on meYou might also like
