Called in sick to the coffee shop
Said let's go someplace the weather is hot
Bought two plane tickets and called a yellow cab
Drank all our money at beachside bars
Took pictures of each other smokin' cheap cigars
Stole a blanket from the hotel room and slept on the sand
We held the world like a glass of lemonade
It tasted sweet
Oh, man we had it made

[Chorus:]
Didn't we laugh, weren't we brave
Wasn't it cool actin' like fools
With nothing in our way
Picture in a frame, deep blue sky
You and I stuck in time like
We would never fade
Baby why'd we have to change

[Verse 2:]
Did we get old or too grown up
To do anything just because
Just because we just don't give a damn
Oh, when did we get so serious
What happened to that part of us
Baby can you help me out, I don't understand
We held the world like a glass of lemonade
It tasted sweet
Oh man, we had it made
You might also like[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Look at us in the photograph
So beautifully naive
I want it back

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Let's call in sick and leave this town
Don't matter where we go let's just go now
I'm thirsty for a glass of lemonade
