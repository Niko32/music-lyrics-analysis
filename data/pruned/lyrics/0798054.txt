Let those stupid birds fly
Let the dog sit on the chair
Let the cat shed its long hair
Let the goldfish swim outside

Let the smokers smoke
Let the politicians lie
Let grandma be a bitch
Athletes be filthy rich
Let the stoners get high

Let's make life a living hell
Let's make life a living hell
Let's take everything we know
Toss it right out the window
Let's make life a living hell

Let the homophobes be scared
Let the gays adopt with care
Republicans steal the dough
Democrats complain more
Let the system let us down

Let Charlton Heston have his gun
Let somebody shoot him just for fun
Pro-life be carnivores
Pro-choice be whores
Let's never help the bums

Let the acid rain fall
Let's not recycle at all
We know what we should do
But I don't care and you don't too
Let the earth decay and die

Let religion kill more
Let non-believers be tortured
Let the tyrants kill
Let the soldiers double kill
Let's all kill kill kill kill kill

Humanity
Fueled by fear and greed
Cultivate and kill
It's our great legacy
So much death to undo
But here's a fucking clue
If we can build a bomb
Can't we build heaven too?
Nah!

Let's make life a living hell
Let's make life a living hell
Let's take everything we know
Toss it right out the window
Let's make life a living hell

Let's make life a living hell
Let's make life a living hell
Let's take everything we know
Toss it right out the window
Let's make life a living hell

So let the damn cows moo
Let the children get abused
Let the goldfish swim outside
Steal from the old and watch 'em die
Lets make life a living hell

HRAH!!!
