This is your chance...
Revolt, resist!
Open your chest
Look down, reach in

[Chorus]
Shedding your skin
Showing your texture
Time to let everything inside show
You're cutting all ties
Now and forever
Time to let everything outside you

[Verse 2]
This is your test...
Come forth, confess!
Extend your tongue
Speak out, go on

[Chorus]
Shedding your skin
Showing your texture
Time to let everything inside show
You're cutting all ties
Now and forever
Time to let everything outside you

Shed your casing
Show your lines and shapes
Wear your insides
On the outside
Show your enemy
What you look like
What you look like
What you look like
From the inside
From the inside

[Refrain]
You're cutting all ties
Now and forever
Time to let

[Chorus]
Shedding your skin
Showing your texture
Time to let everything inside show
You're cutting all ties
Now and forever
Time to let everything outside you

[Outro]
Shed your casing
Show your lines and shapes
Wear your insides
On the outside
Show your enemy
What you look like
What you look like
What you look like
From the inside
From the inside
