[Verse: Justiiice]

I'm lost in my dreams
The haunting of me
There's blood at the scene
I'm seems like I'm leaving
I need your release
You cling to my demons
I sing set me free
You think this is easy
Too much like a dream
I have to be sleeping
I'm clinging to peace
I'm leaping from regret
I land on my feet
I ask for my defense
There's you at my feet
You're asking for me back
