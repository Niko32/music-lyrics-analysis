A mansion on a hill is a lovely sight to see
But like any other house, it's only temporary
Home is anywhere you choose to put your heart;
If there's no love inside, it'll soon fall apart

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust
Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up
And so it goes with everything but love

(And so it goes) with everything but love
(So it goes)

[Verse 2]
You can drive around in a long limousine
If you don't know where you're going, it don't mean a thing
He who'd walk a mile, just to hold an empty hand
Knows what it means, to be a wealthy man

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust
Houses will crumble, bridges will rust
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up
And so it goes with everything but love
You might also like(So it goes) with everything but love
(So it goes)

[Bridge]
Worldly treasures will all pass away
There's just one thing that's put here to stay

[Chorus]
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust
Kingdoms will crumble, bridges will rust
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up
And so it goes with everything but love

(So it goes) with everything but love
(So it goes) with everything but love
(So it goes) with everything but love...
