In the mornin' on a Saturday, I got my girls and we're skippin' town
In my '67 442 got the rag top down
Aldean's on the radio, ain't it funny how they sing along
Makes you smile just a little bit because it's not a Miley Cyrus song

[Pre-Chorus 1]
These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there

[Chorus]
Loadin' up and livin' right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and the fishin' poles
What a way to save my soul
This endless summer

[Verse 2]
Now we're at our little getaway, Zoe go and grab the fishin' poles
I can't think of any other better way for us to cleanse our souls
Fresh trapper on the wheel tonight, cherrystones straight out the shell
Just another day in paradise, another story I can tell
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
These are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there

[Chorus]
Loadin' up and livin' right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the moon is bright
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and the fishin' poles
What a way to save our souls
This endless summer

[Verse 3]
Monday mornin' and it's gettin' late
There's no traffic at the tollbooth line
Aldean's on the radio
And my three girls know every line

[Pre-Chorus 3]
And these are the moments we can share
Come on let me take you there

[Chorus]
Loadin' up and livin' right
Fast cars on a summer night
Breeze is warm and the music's right
This endless summer
Boogie boards and diggin' holes
Sand castles and fishin' poles
What a way to save our souls
This endless summer night
