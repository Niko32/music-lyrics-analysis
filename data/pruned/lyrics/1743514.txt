I'm far from perfect, nothing even close
But that's what makes me beautiful, that's something you should know
I'm not looking for someone to tell me how to row my boat
So let me live and let me learn I promise we will grow

[Chorus]
If you love me like you say you love me
You'll be a man, you'll grab my hand
Take me as I am
I wanna l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love unconditional
I wanna l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love unconditional
I wanna l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love unconditional
I wanna l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I come home and I'm sweaty from the day
And my hair's all in a messy bun 'cause I had to get it out my face
And I rather lace my sneakers up 'cause high heels ain't my thing
And I don't see a flaw in that, I never want to change

[Chorus]
If you love me like you say
You'll be a man, you'll grab my hand
Take me as I am
I wanna l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love unconditional
I wanna l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love unconditional
I wanna l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love unconditional
I wanna l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love

So if you love me like you say
You'll be my man
Grab my hand
Take me as I am
