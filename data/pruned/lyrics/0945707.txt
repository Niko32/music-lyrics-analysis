So fine...
I'm statin' my case for someone
Puttin' it on the line
Are you gonna be the one?

I've been waitin' for someone
So fine...
I wanna know if you think in your life
Maybe you got some time?
Are you gonna be the one?
Are you gonna be the one?

I've been waitin' for someone
So fine...

She's just around the corner
She's tough, fast and sly

I've been waitin' for someone (I've been waitin')
So fine...
I wanna know if you think in your life
Maybe you got some time?
Are you gonna be the one?
Are you gonna be the one?
