[Verse]
I only love you
You know that's true
And you left me
But you're here by me baby

[Chorus]
You know I miss you
You're here by me
You don't care about me
But you're here by me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You know I miss you
You're here by me
You don't care about me
But you're here by meYou might also like
