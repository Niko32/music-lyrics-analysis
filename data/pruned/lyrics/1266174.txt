Have yourself a merry little Christmas
Let your heart be light
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight

[Verse 2]
Have yourself a merry little Christmas (Merry little Christmas)
Make the Yuletide gay (Make the Yuletide gay)
From now on, our troubles will be miles away

[Refrain]
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

[Verse 3]
Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Refrain]
Here we are as in olden days
Happy golden days of yore
Faithful friends who are dear to us
Gather near to us once more

Through the years, we all will be together
If the fates allow
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

[Outro]
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas
