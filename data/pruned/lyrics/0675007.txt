I beg your pardon, Momma, what did you say?
My mind was drifting on a Martinique day
It's not that I'm not interested, you see
Augusta, Georgia is just no place to be

[Chorus]
Just think Jamaica in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking that rum every night
We've got no money, Momma, but we can go
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove

[Verse 2]
Just keep on talking, Momma, I can hear
Your voice, it tickles down inside of my ear
I feel a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to that hillbilly beer

[Chorus]
Just think Jamaica in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking that rum every night
We've got no money, Momma, but we can go
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove

[Verse 3]
Voila, an American dream
Ah we can travel, girl, without any means
It's just as easy as closing your eyes
And dream Jamaica is a big neon sign

[Verse 4]
Just keep on talking, Momma, I like that sound
It goes so good with the rain falling down
I feel a tropical vacation this year
Might be the answer to that hillbilly beer

[Chorus]
Just think Jamaica in the moonlight
Sandy beaches, drinking that rum every night
We've got no money, Momma, but we can go
We'll split the difference, go to Coconut Grove
