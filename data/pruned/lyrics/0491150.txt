You feel out of breath, used up, and broken down
Just like shattered glass in pieces on the ground
Some days you wanna scream but you can't make a sound
But your not alone
Here comes another day, here comes another fight
You'd rather give it up then give it one more try
Cause no one understands the way you feel inside
But your not alone

[Chorus]
Right now it feels like the end of the world
All your battles are lost
You've been cheated (mistreated)
Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer
Hold on a little bit longer
Trust me, you'll see
You'll be so much stronger

[Verse 2]
It's only temporarily but it feel like your stuck
Like no wishing well but it will change your luck
They say when one door closes another opens up
You walk right through yeah you know what to do

[Chorus]
Right now it feels like the end of the world
All your battles are lost
You've been cheated (mistreated)
Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer
Hold on a little bit longer
Trust me, you'll see
You'll be so much stronger
You might also like[Bridge]
You'll might have to bend but you're not gonna break
Wipe the tears from your eyes and the fear off your face
You know deep down inside, you've got what takes

[Chorus]
Right now it feels like the end of the world
All your battles are lost
You've been cheated (mistreated)
Just when you think that you can't hold on any longer
Hold on a little bit longer
Trust me, you'll see
You'll be so much stronger
You'll be so much stronger
