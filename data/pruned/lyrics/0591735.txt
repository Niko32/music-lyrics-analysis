Do I have to go through this with you again
Cryin' on my shoulder
Whenever the nights grow colder
And you need more than another fair weather friend
Will it end before sundown
Before the prettiest girl in this town
Runs away from a showdown with me again

[Chorus]
(Look at me now)
Come on baby, you need a rock you can't toss out
When you're under the covers
You think you're so strong
Holdin' on to me now
You know why you come around
I'm the rock you can't toss out

Don't kiss me say you're gonna miss me
Then ditch me till you come back again
Don't touch me
Tell me how much you love me
If you're not gonna love me
Like the world's gonna end
Maybe I never told you
That I want to hold you
And never wanted to be just friends
You might also like[Chorus]
(Look at me now)
Come on baby, you need a rock you can't toss out
When you're under the covers
You think you're so strong
Holdin' on to me now
You know why you come around
I'm the rock you can't toss out

I know you want to see me
'Cause you're always at my door
Do you leave 'cause you're afraid of seeing something more

[Chorus outro]
...You know why you come around, look at me now
I'm the rock you can't toss out
