I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the starlight, just like we used to do
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you

[Verse 2]
I walk for miles along the highway
Well, that's just my way of sayin' I love you
I'm always walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for you

[Bridge]
I stop to see a weeping willow, cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy, night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

[Chorus]
I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight, just a-hopin' you may be
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me

[Interlude]
You might also like[Bridge]
I stop to see a weeping willow, cryin' on his pillow
Maybe he's cryin' for me
And as the skies turn gloomy, night winds whisper to me
I'm lonesome as I can be

[Chorus]
I go out walkin' after midnight
Out in the moonlight, just a-hopin' you may be
Somewhere a-walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for me

[Outro]
I go out walkin' after midnight
Searchin' for... you
