Well something’s wrong in the brain, unreasons the tears
Whispers and voices masquerade through the fears
Allies now foes abusers in gears
You are alone in the dark reaching new frontiers

Your heart won’t give up after all these years
Constructed in your teens more than able it appears
Go brush your teeth and wipe all those tears
Who cares what you know, your hair look fierce

[Chorus: G]
Just hop out of the bed
Go ahead face the day
Who cares what you know
Don't let that in the way no way

Shut out all the doubt
Just get up and go
What's on the other side
You will never know unless

You rip your art apart
Take it from the start
Who cares if you’re slow
Go prove them wrong anyway
You might also likeUndress your suit of doubt
Address them through the veil
Put your good face on
Web your way up to the top
Top, top, top, tooop [x3]
Top, top, top, top dog

[Verse 2: G]
Step out of the game and its another show
Retreat and them goose stage another “ho”
Demanding be the level but where else can you go
Courage my friend we can’t avoid but grow

Quit the streaming and start the scheming
Though I beg you don’t forget the importance of the feeling
To be that dog need your shit be affecting
Make your heart out of gold, your spirit’s now resurrecting

[Verse 3: K]
We were gonna cancel
Felt like nothing left to show
Like a wild prey with a lost sense of home

We're not gonna cancel
Looking over D 17
Let the rumours live the day that they have
We're not gonna cancel
Still here when time and grants have long moved on

Everything is clear now
No it's not and never will
But the lie keeps depression at bay

[Chorus: K]
No one cares what you know
We all care who you know
The ghosts of your networks
Will haunt you til the day you die
The only skill you need
Yeah, only one, come to think
Is to shut out all the fear
This starts with an n and an o

No, no, no
Learn the word
[x4]
No thanks

[Verse 4: K]
I do Helsinki and London
Like Drake, from the condo
Skip the parties throw in the work
I've been in Athens with phones off
They say attention is a graveyard
Where even the ghosts are scared to be
I'll spend this life carving my torah
Lost all hope for the agora
Agora, i go around, and come back, changed
