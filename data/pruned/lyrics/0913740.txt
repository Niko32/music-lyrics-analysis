Some will say it can't be won
So it gets harder when your shoes are snake ( Not sure of this lyric)
But I had set my mind to run

But it was harder than I bargined for
Broken dreams at evey turn
I had hard enough to almost make it through
And a lesson yet to learn

I slipped at fell before the finish line
Just when it seemed I couldn't loose
I can fall anytime you want me too
You are the shit beneath my shoeYou might also like
