Tears on my pillow keep falling
And I'm crying over you, crying over you
How long will the time last before my heart
Is blessed to see the day I'm back with you
The day I'm back with you
See, I'm yearning for you, baby, constantly I'm reminiscing
Always think bout the things we used to do, oh yeah
And I'm singing, baby...

[Chorus]
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
Love can't hide
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
The pain inside

[Verse 2]
Am I wrong for love that's been lost and found
Looking for someone to make the claim, oh tell me
Why am I an example of heart turned cold
Looking for someone to take the blame
Won't nobody take it for me, baby?
Reflections of your silhouette at the corners of my bed
I try to close my eyes and go to sleep
Still I see you in my dreams, yeah baby
I'm singing...
You might also like[Chorus]
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
Love can't hide
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
The pain inside
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
Love can't hide
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
Oh...

[Bridge]
Are my dreams of love a mirage of paradise?
As the weeks turn to months
And so many sleepless nights
For the day I pray my tears are wiped away
You'll hold me in your loving arms always
And I'm singing, baby...

[Chorus]
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
Love can't hide
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
The pain inside
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
Love can't hide
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
The pain inside
[Bridge]
Can you tell me, are my dreams of love a mirage of paradise?
As the weeks turn to months
And so many sleepless nights
For the day I pray my tears will wipe away
You'll hold me in your loving arms always
I'm telling you love can't hide...

[Chorus]
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
Love can't hide
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
The pain inside
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
Love can't hide
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
The pain inside
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
Love can't hide
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
The pain inside
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
Love can't hide
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
The pain inside
Bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da, bop-ba-da
Love can't hide
