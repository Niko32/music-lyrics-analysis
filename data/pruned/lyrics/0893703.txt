Well, I'm not sure if this'll come out right
I've been playin' it over and over in my mind
So just in case you want to know
Exactly how I feel, well here it goes

[Chorus]
I'm sure that my heart pounds a little faster when you're near
And I'm positive that I would go crazy without you here
There's no doubt in my mind
Am I sure that I'm in love?
Well baby, I'm sure enough
Yeah, I'm sure enough

[Verse 2]
I don't claim to know everything
Your guess is good as mine what tomorrow will bring
One thing's clear and it stands above
I want to be with you, yeah I'm sure enough

[Chorus]
And I'm sure that my heart pounds a little faster when you're near
And I'm positive that I would go crazy without you here
There's no doubt in my mind
When you ask if I'm in love
Well baby, I'm sure enough
Yeah, I'm sure enough
You might also like[Chorus]
And I'm sure that my heart pounds a little faster when you're near
And I'm positive that I would go crazy without you here
There's no doubt in my mind
Am I sure that I'm in love?
Well baby, I'm sure enough
Yeah, I'm sure enough
