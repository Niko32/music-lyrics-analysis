Look into my eyes
You will see
What you mean to me
Search your heart
Search your soul
Oh, when you find me there
You search no more

[Chorus]
Don't tell me
It's not worth tryin' for
You can't tell me
It's not worth dyin' for
You know it's true (You know it's true)
Everything I do
I do it for you!
(Yeah, babe)

[Verse 2]
Look into your heart
You will find
There is nothin' there to hide
Take me as I am (Take me as I am)
Take my life
I would give it all
I would sacrifice!
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't tell me
It's not worth fighting for
I can't help it, nothin' I want more
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do it for you!

[Bridge]
There is no love
Like your love
An' no other
Could give me more love
There's nowhere
Unless your there
All the time
All the way!

[Break]
Oh-oh
Ba, da, da, da, da
Everything I do!

[Verse 3]
You can't tell me
It's not worth tryin' for
Just can't help it
Nothin' in the world I want more
Oh, I would fight for you
Yeah, I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you
Yeah, I'd die for you!
[Outro]
You know it's true
Everything I do
I do it for you!
(Oh)
