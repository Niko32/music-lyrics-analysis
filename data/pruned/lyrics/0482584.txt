So I don’t wanna go (wanna go back)
I just wanna chill wanna take it slow
Fuck it ill just turn off my phone
And il decide when its time to go X2

Yeah this life is so crazy man
Mum thinks im a fuckin damn maniac
Cause im trapped in a room and I love to rap
And I don’t think there is anything wrong with that

Cause Im in the sky
Flyin like a jump jet (a jump jet)
Runnin behind and I can't even take off yet (take off yet)
Im in the clouds where I live
I ain't comin down for none of this shit
Your just tryna fight im blockin my ears
I am just a kid with peace signs in the air

(Hook/chorus)
And  I don’t wanna go (wanna go back)
I just wanna chill wanna take it slow
Fuck it ill just turn off my phone
And il decide when its time to go X2

Cause I am just a kid
And I ain't grown up yet
Lost boys day ones for the taken
Lifes a vacation
It is what you make it
So please don’t waste it
Please don’t waste it
Im getting faded
Up in a space ship
Fuck all these pirates
Im layin sunbaking
Wendy is over there getting so wasted
Boffin’ it all up on the fuckin’ pavement
Literally livin in a dream
This is really how it seems man
You may think that this is all make believe damn
But this is all I know (this is all I know)
Im in a world where theres no government
And wars and shit
I fuckin love it here
I don’t wanna go go back again
You might also like(Hook/chorus)
So I don’t wanna go (wanna go back)
I just wanna chill wanna take it slow
Fuck it ill just turn off my phone
And il decide when its time to go X
