Sweet simple song
Of different lights and different shades
The sound of life erupts and fades
And all the world must play along
My life has been a song

[Verse 2: Robin Gibb]
Here as I sleep
The love I dream will gently creep
Inside my heart I softly keep
The tune that plays too long
My life has been a song

[Hook: Barry Gibb]
Every sound in my head
Every word that I said
Is like a melody, melody
That no little person like me
Could ever change
Every sound in the street
All the cold and the heat
Is like a symphony, symphony
Which has never before been rearranged

[Verse 1: Robin Gibb]
