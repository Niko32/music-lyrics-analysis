Possess the stamina for more than 12 rounds
Cause I give my whole heart, it’s Mr. Seven Pounds

[Hook: Tremell and Shawn B]
If you look me in my eyes
You would realize that I’m headed for the skies
Pushing for success, I’ma bring it home
I’ma hold my own, if I gotta stand alone, yeah
But they try to tell me slow down
Haters try to stop me, but I’m on a roll now
Try to understand this is all I am
I’m just a broken man, take all I am

[Verse 1: Derrell Peoples]
Developing better plots, caught up in clever thoughts of trying to grow
But you know it's a process
Trying to go from being feeble to monstrous, frosty the snow man to lochness, mayne
In this society, trying to find sobriety, deprived of pride & my rights been denied to me
A slogan goes to be all that you can be, but its tough when you lack all the tools that you may need
Just a dollar and a dream, and a member from my team, a remembrance of the ones who really didn't believe
See, back at home the situation was gloom we needed room so we made the move to Orlando to bloom
And now I make it hard to respirate, with no hesitation, exceed expectation
Posses the stamina for more then 12 rounds, cause I give my whole heart, it’s Mr. Seven Pounds

It’s hard to see far when your vision is so cloudy
And it’s hard to settle down when your mind is so rowdy
Oh no, don’t go, can’t move, too fast, see snakes in grass can’t let them pass, at all
Gotta pick yo back right up off of that wall
Cause they just wanna see you fall, and all in all wanna see you fall
They want you dead or go to jail, oh well play ball or go to Yale
This world so tough make you wanna yell, oh well
Tell me what it’s hittin fo
See me right now watch me give some mo
Can’t go back to the days when we was po
All my life I’ve seen highs and lows
Lows and highs, feel like Will Ferrell in The Other Guys
Probably got evicted bout 6 times, and right back then write 6 more rhymes, life and times
Yeah, and that’s real rap, wanna ride in somethin’ that’s black on black
Wanna keep the peace but I will keep that strap
Sorry young niggas we don’t know to act, oh man
But I’m so glad when one becomes and when its all said it done, you’ll see what we’ve become

[Hook]

[Outro: Lavell Jones]
Possess the stamina for more than 12 rounds
Cause I give my whole heart it’s Mr. Seven Pounds, go
Seven Pounds, it’s Mr. Seven Pounds, whoa
Seven Pounds, it’s Mr. Seven Pounds, you hold it down
Seven Pounds, it’s Mr. Seven Pounds
Cause I give my whole heart it’s Mr. Seven Pounds, go
Seven Pounds, it’s Mr. Seven Pounds
Give my whole heart it’s Mr. Seven Pounds, hold it down
