Ay, ooh yeah
Ay, ooh yeah
Oh yeah
Ciara
That's me
The dreamer
The-Dream
Ohh yeah, ohh
Baby...

[Verse 1: Ciara & The Dream]
Wanna say come over, but I told you that it's over
How much pain can my heart take? Oh yeah
And well, I wish that you were closer
So I can love over, over again
Today I may have lost my friend
(Girl)

[Chorus: Ciara & The Dream]
You, you are my baby
I can't just let you leave
I'm caught up in this lover's thing
It's love, and that I can't deny
Won't even start to lie
I'm caught up in this lover's thing
Baby, you

Baby (Ay), baby

[Verse 2: Ciara & The Dream]
Girl, take back your decision
And paint me back in your picture
I'm calling on your phone girl
You keep sending me straight to voicemail
Now why ain't he persistent
I'm sure by now he misses this
Calling on the phone, you won't answer my call

[Chorus: Ciara & The Dream, Both]
And you, you are my baby
I can't just let you leave
I'm caught up in this lover's thing
Yeah, it's love, and that I can't deny
Won't even start to lie
I'm caught up in this lover's thing
[Post-Chorus: Ciara & (The Dream)]
Baby (Ay), baby (Ay)
Baby (Ay), baby
Baby (Ay), baby (Ay)
Baby (Ay), baby

Ooh (Ay), uhh
Ohh and he knows that I care
Ooh, uhh
Will you ever forgive me?
Ooh, uhh
Hello, are you there?

[Chorus: Ciara & The Dream]
And you, you are my baby
I can't just let you leave
I'm caught up in this lover's thing
Yeah, it's love, and that I can't deny
Won't even start to lie
I'm caught up in this lover's thing
