I'm sittin' here lookin' at some mighty hard times
Money ain't growing on trees
A little while ago I was rollin' in dough
Singin' all you want when you please

[Chorus:]
All you want when you please girls
All you want when you please

[Verse 2:]
The wind blows up this road all summer
In the evening it cools one and all
If you like a good breeze you can have all you please
If you don't get blown away in the fall

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
My money's all gone
And my breeze died down my bloom of youth's gone to seed
I sit here and cry for the days all gone
By when I sang all you want when you please

[Chorus]
You might also like[Verse 4:]
Well the meat's all lean and the bread's all done
And the cook rides a big white horse
You just come like you look and if you get your picture took
You can tell 'em you was at the Mardi Gras

[Chorus]
