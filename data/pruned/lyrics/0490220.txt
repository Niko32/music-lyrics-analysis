Streescape
Treetop
Lo City You ready? Come On!

(Verse One: Kehmak)
Who's sayin whose sane? Go Hussain on em
In a dark cave and going all Bruce Wayne on em
New wave flow they bang tho
That 2 Chainz Dough D'jango Durango

Filled fulla bitches built for the bitches
Me no speak no language me no alblo English
Your politicking while were partying with college women
Got my wallet dripping like the faucet in your mommas kitchen

I'm a alcoholic all I wanted was a honest living
Built this Brick House feeling like I'm Lionel Richie
Feeling like Obama winning ain't no fucking comppition
We the hottest in the city we ain't got a pot to piss in

Getting pissed off and I smack bitches and
Casper slapped somebody with his Jack Richardson
It's big Mizzy with a chip on his shoulder
Only chick I ever loved Ms Vickys no the bridge isn't over

(Hook x2: Del Reze)
We better then ever there ain't no falling now
You name calling with no name  worth calling out
Treetop call it out Streetscape call it out
Lo City we showing you what were all about


(Verse Two: Del Reze)

All off the brain take a minute fall off the chain
We wining its not gonna change precision I've gotta aim
Now I'm on one yeah I'm taking my time
Homie you want some cause I've got plenty of rhymes

I'm hot with the flow it's just not gonna stop gotta focus
In on the mind of a wordsmith poet feeling the moment go its
Not a game no controller no console
Not a remote chance so drive slow (drive slow)

You feel it right ????? when I hit the mic
We on a roll and we get it right we get it right
We kill a mic we kill a mic
Reveal the mic conceal the knife (Slice)

What happened to all of the rappers yapping involved
Ya'll are just talking while were actually off
On the road to it so we go do it
And if we ain't involved then there's no movement

(Hook x2)


(Verse Three: Casper The Ghost)
Now that the alcohol is outta the system
Allot of people gave me opportunities I dissed em
I was ignorant as fuck I could write like John Grisham
Turn my life into a book kept it focused on the mission

I'm a fucking idiot but I'll admit it won't I
Ever since my big head had to pop up with that holy water
When I woke up was thinking bacon cake and more vagina
Sick of waiting I just lost my mind I can't afford to find it

Til I'm resorting in a warmer climate
The only time I'll give a shit is at the porter potty
I can call myself the ghost cause I'm the son of Joyce
I had to do it dog I really had no other choice

Life's real you can hear it in my fucking voice
There's a fine line between art and a bunch of noise
And this here is a bunch of art
I'm rebuilding what I helped destroy

(Hook x2)
