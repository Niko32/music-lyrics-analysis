Yo Uh smoking Arizona good weed gonna put me in acoma
These days never catch a nigga sober live La Vida Loca
Posted on the corner, New york all the way too California
Smoking kush blunts everyday on the sofa, make em last longer
Sitting in the sauna where niggas got revolvers
Uh purp blazing jamming on vacation out to Jamaica
Where Bob Marley made it, beach house taken girls butt naked
Smoking spliffs all day my lungs can't take it
Woman get faded drugs get raided road block 4 am the
Cops Ain't playing ha where my Yardies got block partys
Gunshots go off gonna stop the whole party
Respect to the Sargent death to the hornets
Suppressed in the darkness evaluate my options
Respect to my father raise me as a Rasta
Now im smoking weed everyday it ain't a problem
Shank you for a dollar bronx niggas taught me
Now im laying low in the Chevy with a 40
Pack of niggas storm in at 8 in the morning
Catch me off guard high as fuck with a shawty
Full of happy stories liberty and glory
Aiming for the better things success
And the money bring, ball out like
The Jeffersons nice car big crib
In the Netherlands, more expensive
Shit soon get obsessed with it
The more important things in life
Get neglected quick, thats some
Extra shit watch who you stepping
With they lead you right to
Your death be prepared for it
You feel me
