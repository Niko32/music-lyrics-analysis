I got that work, come and cop a Lava t-shirt
Teeny boppers flirt, I'm just slinging merch
I don't even really know my worth
But I can tell you about these CDs and tag up your chichis
Getting money is the thing
Plus I got these fans, they're my friends and they're hip-hop fiends
Never let another rapper shine
Cause after I rhyme, I'm at the merch booth
On my grind, the grit and the grime
The Sankofa sign
Pep Love get the money when I go for mine
I can talk obnoxious and walk with a bop
Just because I know I got this stock in boxes
The crowd gathers round and flocks us
I'm perched at the merch booth trying to get acquainted with your pockets
Hot chicks, you can get a discount
When you meet me at my room you don't want to miss out

[Hook]
Clocking that merch, stocking that merch
Rocking that merch, we got that merch

[Verse 2: Pep Love]
I love y'all, you know I love y'all
I'm standing on stage, but not above y'all
We A alikes if you listen to the music
From the booth to the stage to the booth with my new shit
I'm enterprising, I'm improvising
I'm catching eyes because I'm rocking so many different items
I got a purpose
I'm a motherfucking merchant and making moves urgent
Rhymes in my mind get dimes on my line
To reach mankind I just take it one person at a time
The product that I conduct
Will have that merch moving like water in an aqueduct
And whatnot
I got my own, I got my crew, too
Sweatshirts, stickers and hats is what the booth do
For my true blues we bringing good news
And you can get it from us, I thought you knew
