Dark, you can't come soon enough for me
Saved from one more day of misery
Everything I love, get back from me now
Everyone I love, I need you now
Don't forget a million miles from me
Safe and another day can pass by me
Everything I love, get back from me now
Everyone I love, I'd need you now

[Pre-Chorus]
(So what?)
So I conned, I lied
I lie to me too
(So what?)
So I conned, I lied
I lie to me too
(So what?)

[Chorus]
Hold out for the ones you know will love you
Hide out from the ones you know will love you
You, you too

[Verse 2]
Right to the edge I'm barely there
Slow to make my move, I'm almost there
Everything I say, I say to me first
Everything I do, I do to me first
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
(So what?)
So what, I lied
I lie to me too
(So what?)
So what, I lied
I lie to me too
(So what?)

[Chorus]
Hold out for the ones you know will love you
Hide out from the ones you know will love you
You, you too

[Outro]
Dark, you can't come soon enough for me
