The separation of re-lig-i-on
I feel the wisdom in God's word could help everyone
In your state-owned school
My homeroom teacher
My famished heart is more than eager
But my reason for readin'
Is gettin' the truth
And if you said this Bible ain't good enough
For the real-life world so give it up
I could change my mind to better suit your rules
But it's still true
Well, it's just like the notion that one and one is two
It's the same as any question on a test from you
You've got to find solutions that can be absolute
So live in the dark ages still ... or else go get a Bible
I'll tell you one thing
If you don't read it it's a cryin' shame
Can't live by bread but every word I hear that came
Out of His mouth
I love the Bible so
It's like arithmetic and reading though
I feel the learning of the world goes awful slow â€" shutting it out
And if you said this Bible ain't good enough
For the real-life world so give it up
I could change my mind to better suit your rules
But it's still true
Well, it's just like the notion that one and one is two
It's the same as any question on a test from you
You've got to find ya something that can be called truth
So live in the dark ages still ... or else go get a Bible
