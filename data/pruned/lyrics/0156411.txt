It's all because, yeah

[Verse 1]
I waited for so long, you showed me you were the one
I gave you my heart, right from the very start
So every time you lied, I knew inside, get another chance
I was hurting, I was broken, I stayed too long
And so that's why you didn't think that I'd move on

[Chorus]
It's all because I loved you
(Because) I held you
(Because) I believed you
You're not what I needed
(Because) I'm stronger
(Because) I'm better
(Because) Without you
You thought I'd be in pieces because
(You thought I'd be in pieces) Because I loved ya
(Because) I loved ya
(Because) I loved ya

[Verse 2]
You gave me just one thing, but taking from the beginning
You left me a heartache, how much more could I take?
With every alibi that made me cry, I'd still give you more
I should've given up, when I had had enough
But I stayed too long, that's why, you didn't think that I'd move on

It's all because I loved you
(Because) I held you
(Because) I believed you
You're not what I needed
(Because) I'm stronger
(Because) I'm better
(Because) Without you
(You thought I'd be in pieces) Because
(You thought I'd be in pieces) Because I loved ya
(Because) I loved ya
(Because) I loved ya

[Bridge]
I made a mistake of giving me to you
I made a mistake of loving you
I made a mistake of giving me to you
I made a mistake of loving you
I made a mistake of giving me to you
I made a mistake of loving you
I made a mistake of giving me to you
I made a mistake

[Chorus]
It's all because I loved you
(Because) I held you
(Because) I believed you
You're not what I needed
(Because) I'm stronger
(Because) I'm better
(Because) Off without you
(You thought I'd be in pieces) Because
(I loved you, I loved you, I loved you because, yeah)
(You thought I'd be in pieces) Because
(I loved you, I loved you, I loved you because, yeah)

(I loved you, I loved you, I loved you because, yeah)
(You thought I'd be in pieces) Because I loved ya
(I loved you, I loved you, I loved you because, yeah)
(Because) I loved ya
(Because) I loved ya
(Because) Yeah, yeah
