And there's angels defeating themselves
And you can't get past half past eleven
Without feeding the sharks on the shelf
Then...
Faster than the setting sun we'll run away
Faster than the setting sun
Faster than the setting sun we'll run away
When you can't sleep for all of these visions
Of the iridescent lands
And you can't reach a single decision
Without your wet face kissing your hands
Then throw it in the sand
(breathe it in, breathe it out)
Try to understand
Love lands
Faster than the setting sun
Faster than the setting sun we'll run away
Faster than the setting sun
Faster than the setting sun...
No they don't slow dance 'round here no more
No they don't slow dance 'round here no more
No they don't slow dance 'round here no more
No they don't slow dance 'round here no more
Faster than the setting sun we'll run away
Faster than the setting sun
No they don't slow dance 'round here no more
No they don't slow dance 'round here no more
No they don't slow dance 'round here no more
No they don't slow dance 'round here no more
No more
