Hello

[Verse 1]
My luck was so bad
I thought I used up all the luck I had
Everytime I thought I'd get it on
Someone put me on

There's been a change

[Verse 2]
Beautiful and strange
My life's gone through a change
Somehow I know (somehow I know)
Bad luck's in the past
All good things here at last
So now we'll grow

There's been a change
Mmmmm
Bad luck (no more)
No bad luck (no more)
No bad luck (no more)
No bad luck (no more)

No bad luck (no more)

I got news for you
There ain't no blues
I got news for you
No bad luck (no more)
No bad luck (no more)

I got news for you
There ain't no blues
I got news for you
No bad luck (no more)
No bad luck (no more)

[Outro]
Listen to the voice loud and clear
Come on folks, withstand you fears
Celebrate the choice is yours, you choose
Celebrate the news, there ain't no blues
