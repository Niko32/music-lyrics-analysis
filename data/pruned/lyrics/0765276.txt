I wanna dedicate this song
To all the women, all over the world
That have to still deal with this issue
You know I've been there too
I had to deal with it with you
But come on now ladies, how many times he got to say her name?
Listen...

[Verse 1]
You came home late last night
You smelled just like the scent of her
Not only that but you had lipstick all over your shirt
I'm thinking to myself
This man has no respect for me
I knew it all along 'cause you were talking in your sleep

[Chorus]
It's a wrap (It's a wrap)
Why you go and do me like that?
(Why you wanna do me like that?)
I thought the love was good
(Thought the love was good)
But I misunderstood, baby
(I misunderstood)
It's a wrap (It's a wrap)
And I am not surprised
(Said I'm not surprised)
How you could sit right here (How you could sit right here)
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
I heard you callin' her name (Heard you callin' her name)
In your sleep last night (In your sleep last night)
What are we gonna do? (What are we gonna do?)
'Cause I'm through with you
I heard you callin' her name (Heard you call her name)
In your sleep last night (In your sleep last night)
What are we gonna do? (What are we gonna do?)
'Cause I'm through with you
I heard you

[Verse 2]
What you were saying in your sleep
It violated me
No doubt about it
But there's nothing left for you and me
Because you're busted
And I might as well go on
Boy, it's gonna take a long time
To make this a happy home
You know

[Chorus]
It's a wrap (Yeah)
Why you go and do me like that?
(Why you wanna do me like that?)
I thought the love was good
(Thought the love was good)
But I misunderstood, baby
(But I misunderstood)
It's a wrap (It's a wrap)
And I am not surprised
(Said I'm not surprised)
How you could sit right here (You could sit right here)
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie
[Post-Chorus]
I heard you callin' her name (Heard you callin' her name)
In your sleep last night (In your sleep last night)
What are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?)
'Cause I'm through with you
I heard you callin' her name (Heard you callin' her name)
In your sleep last night (In your sleep last night)
What are we gonna do? (What are we gonna do?)
'Cause I'm through with you
I heard you

[Bridge]
All you had to do was say (All you had to do was say)
I don't wanna be with you (I don't wanna be with you)
Why don't you tell the truth? (Why don't you tell the truth?)
'Cause I already got the proof (I already got the proof)
It'll never be the same (It'll never be the same)
You know it's crying shame (It's a crying shame)
Because now I am disgusted (So digusted)
You are so busted

I heard you callin' her name (I heard you callin' her name, yeah yeah)
In your sleep last night (In your sleep last night)
What are we gonna do?
(What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do?)
'Cause I'm through with you
I heard you callin' her name (You called her)
In your sleep last night (Over and over again)
What are we gonna do? (Over and over and over)
'Cause I'm through with you
I heard you callin' her name (I washed my hands with you)
In your sleep last night (I'm so so through)
What are we gonna do?
'Cause I'm through with you
I heard you callin' her name (I heard you call her name)
In your sleep last night (In your sleep last night)
What are we gonna do?
'Cause I'm through with you
I heard you

[Chorus]
Why you go and do me like that?
I thought the love was good
But I misunderstood, baby
It's a wrap (It's a wrap)
And I am not surprised
How you could sit right here
And look me in my eyes and tell a lie
