Though you're gone I can't forget
Right or wrong I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with that same old regret

And all along I thought I'd lose you
And still I prayed that you'd be true
In your heart please just remember
Right or wrong I'm still in love with you

Oh, play it for me
Oh, yeah

Oh, right or wrong I'll always love you
Though you're gone I can't forget
Right or wrong I'll keep on dreaming
Still I wake with the some old' regret

And all along I thought I'd lose you
And still I prayed that you'd be true, Lord Lord
In your heart, please just remember
Right or wrong I'm still in love with you, ohYou might also like
