Hey, [?] Lil Spook
Yeah, yeah
You know you're so sexy, babe
You know you're so sexy, babe
You know you're so sexy, babe
Yeah


Baby, you see me in the dark
Please don't break my heart
Why do you push me away?
Stay the night with me in my place
All I have to say is girl you make me feel famous
Speak in only body language (Yeah)
I've been waiting just to say this

Creeping through alleys with you
Is all that I want to do
All the resin residue
To you I'll forever be true
Wander the forest
The rain always pouring
The heavens they cover our shoes
Whatever you do either ride with my crew
Just know you'll always be my boo
You might also likeJust take my hand, let me be your man
And we'll never come back to this place again
Grant me one wish, just give me a kiss

Just shoot for my heart, please baby don't miss
Just shoot for my heart, please baby don't miss
Just shoot for my heart, please baby don't miss
Just shoot for my heart, please baby don't miss (now)

(Yeah this is Lil Spook)

All I have to say is, girl you make me feel famous
All I, all I, all I, all I have to say is, girl you make me feel famous
