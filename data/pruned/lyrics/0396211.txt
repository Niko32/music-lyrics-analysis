Walking on the streets of DC
On the East Coast - where I live
You say "What's the problem?
What's with this angry kid?"
You don't like the way I walk
Or the way I talk
Or the way I swing my hands
You don't like the words I speak
Or the thoughts I think
And I know you'll never understand

[Pre-Chorus]
You know
On the East Coast we ride until we die
You know

[Chorus]
Well there's a place inside my mind, yeah
A place you'll never find
There's a place inside my mind
Walk this way
You know

[Verse 2]
And wouldn't it be perfect
If I could sit with you?
And we would change a thing or two?
We'd change a thing or two?
We would change the way you think
We would change the way I think
We can't change the way they think
So we're not changing anything
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You know
On the East Coast we ride until we die
You know

[Chorus]
Well there's a place inside my mind, yeah
A place you'll never find
There's a place inside my mind
We'll leave today
You know

[Bridge]
Cause on the east coast, we ride
Until the day we die

[Chorus]
Well there's a place inside my mind, yeah
A place you'll never find
There's a place inside my mind
Walk this way
There's a place inside my mind, yeah
A place you'll never find
There's a place inside my mind
We'll leave today
You know
