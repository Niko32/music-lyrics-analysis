My momma didn’t raise no fool
At least so I thought
Then I fell like all the rest
Like it or not

From across the room it seemed like
A harmless glance
But once she’d set her sights on me
I didn’t stand a chance

[Chorus]
'Cause she’s easy on the eyes
Hard on a heart
That girl stole mine away
And then she tore it apart
I thought I knew better than to fall for her ways
But when I wasn't looking I got caught in her gaze
She’s easy on the eyes
Hard on a heart
Mmmm

[Verse 2]
She don’t mean nothing by it
It's just her way
She ain’t thinking about tomorrow
She’s living for today
And I don't know why I can’t be satisfied
With a feels right, all night, no strings, good time
And she says goodbye
You might also like[Chorus]
She’s easy on the eyes
Hard on a heart
That girl stole mine away
And then she tore it apart
I thought I knew better than to fall for her ways
But when I wasn't looking I got caught in her gaze
She’s easy on the eyes

[Bridge]
Ooh
You’d think I was hypnotized
Ooh
The way I can’t keep her off of my mind

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
She’s easy on the eyes
Hard on a heart
That girl stole mine away
And then she tore it apart
I thought I knew better than to fall for her ways
But when I wasn't looking I got caught in her gaze
She’s easy on the eyes
Hard on a heart
