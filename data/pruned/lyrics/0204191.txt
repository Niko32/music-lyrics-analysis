Darkness, drink
Bottles, drink
Stupid, drink
AR, drink
Trapped, drink
Broken, drink
Fuck you, drink
FUCK YOU, drink!

[Verse 1]
I been stressin' it's a blessin' that I'm still walking these days
I'm a stray with no collar I'm a dollar short, day late
Suffocate, hear me rape, my own mind with a damn vibrate-
OR not its your choice, but I'm drowning in my voice
What's the reason got me bleedin' gettin' caught up in the ignorance
But the catch to it is I started this with a pen and pape and the hope to spit
Now I sit, here I am, dying inside filled with emptiness
And its how I'm meant to live See me smile through the midst of it - Zell

[Hook]
I'm just looking for the exit so I can live my life normal
Fuck a suit & tie I'm trying not to be formal
Swimming pool full of liquor I'm a dive in it
Exits at the bottom I'm a dive in it
So fuck your pretty smile I refuse to fall in love
Magnums in my wallet let me know if you wanna fuck
Swimming pool full of liquor I'mma dive in it
Exits at the bottom I'm a dive in it

[Verse 2]
Lookin' for an exit but the door I cannot find
In a bind, breakin rules that I set up with my mind
Here's protection, told myself, its the way to keep my health
So I step up to the plate fuck the love I'm about that hate
Fuck the wealth of the spirit liquor fills the fuckin void
But emotions taking over and I'm so fucking annoyed
So much noise, fills my head, Romeo's voice is what I dread
So I'm sippin the bottle to drown out the nonsense
Diving much deeper into my subconscious

[Verse 3]
But I don't get it where's the picture so I'll slit my throat for paint
Now I can't focus with my life drained on the carpet yea, I CAN'T
But I don't care, maybe this is the exit that I need
Take a walk on the wildside as I watch myself bleed
Still I'm kissin' the bottle like fuckin' french model
Its down for the ride like fuckin' full throttle
So fuck automatic its manual hatred
AntiRomantic no feelings could change it
I'm falling on the ground I refuse to make a sound
Maybe the bottom of the pool is my fucking way out..
