But my window is closed
I'm drinking wine
And I'm scared to the bones

Woman in white dress
Stands outside
I know so good her name

Things went dark
Right before my eyes
I hear She's coming

Hello! Can You help me!

Hello my dear
My name is dead
Don't be afraid
Would you mind if I smoke

You've got five minutes
To pack your clothes
Then we are leaving

You have a right
To make one phone
But then we are leaving
You might also likeHello! Can You help me!
