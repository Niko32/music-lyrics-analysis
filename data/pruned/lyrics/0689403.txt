It's my life, God was the one to give it
And I ain't going to let nobody tell me how to live it
It's my song, right or wrong
You can tag along or you can stay behind
They're my troubles
Don't you let them worry you none
'Cause when I signed on to be a man
I, I knew I was going to have some

[Chorus]
Like I say, go or stay either way
You ain't going to change my life
You ain't going to change my life

[Verse 2]
When I'm low down and I'm lazy
And I'm ragged but I'm real
And I ain't never been nobody's pride and joy
Yeah, and you can take a boy out of the country
But you can't take the country out of the boy
Well, it's my troubles
Now don't you let them worry you none
Because I signed on to be a man
I figured I was gonna have some
You might also like[Chorus]

[Outro]
It's my song, right or wrong
You ain't gonna change my life
I said, it's my life
You ain't gonna change my life, oh no
