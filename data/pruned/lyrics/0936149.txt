Tell how you do those things you do
I’m really craving you
I think about you all the time, can’t get you off my mind
I do get through the day
I got so much to say
I’m really falling sick awaiting
Gotta make you mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I really gotta tell you, what's up?
As I’ve been thinking lately about us
Never thought I could want someone this much
Pure love is hard to find
So let’s give it a try
I need you in my life (In my life)
'Cause together, boy, we could be so right

[Chorus]
Baby, I wanna tell you that I don’t know how
Can’t deny all the feelings that I have inside
It’s time that you see
That I’m what you need
'Cause together, boy, we could be so right

[Verse 2]
I’ve been waiting patiently
For you to approach me
But time is passing so I’m thinking I should make the move
Hard, but I’ve got to try
Just look into my eyes
You’d feel what I feel, I know it’s real
There’s nothing left to prove
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, I really gotta tell you, what's up?
As I’ve been thinking lately about us
Never thought I could want someone this much
Pure love is hard to find
So let’s give it a try
I need you in my life (In my life)
'Cause together boy we’d be so right

[Chorus]
Baby, I wanna tell you that I don’t know how
Can’t deny all the feelings that I have inside
It’s time that you see
That I’m what you need
'Cause together, boy, we could be so right

[Bridge]
If only you’d know you changed my life
(In a thousand ways I)
I wouldn’t have to wish you were mine
(And it’s not the days or)
I gotta try telling you how I feel
'Cause I know that what I feel could be so real
And I would never let you go

[Chorus]
Baby, I wanna tell you that I don’t know how
Can’t deny all the feelings that I have inside
It’s time that you see
That I’m what you need
'Cause together, boy, we could be so right
Baby, I wanna tell you that I don’t know how
Can’t deny all the feelings that I have inside
It’s time that you see
That I’m what you need
'Cause together, boy, we could be so right
