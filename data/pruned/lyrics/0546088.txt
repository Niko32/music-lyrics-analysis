But everything’s going on
Bad news travels fast
Nothing is meant to last

You always write it down
Tell me when you have grown up
To face the truth in past
To fix the mess you left

We always got the chance to change
What ever happened to the good old days
What’s on your mind

Living day by day
The most legendary fairytail
All things must pass
That’s why we’re built to last

I know you take it slow
There’s fire down below
I hope it wirks out well for you
Meet us in hell

You lost your tongue
And now you come undone
Cause everything went wrong
But you still keep moving onYou might also like
