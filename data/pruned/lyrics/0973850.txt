'Bout a lazy farmer who wouldn't hoe his corn
The reason why I never could tell
But that young man was always well

He planted his corn in the month of June
By July it was up to his eyes
Come September came a big frost
And all the young man's corn was lost

His courtship had just begun
Said, "Young man, have you hoed some corn?"
"Well, I tried and I tried and I tried in vain
But I don't believe I raised one grain."

He went downtown to his neighbor's door
He had often been before
Said, "Pretty little miss, will you marry me?
Little miss what do you say?"

"Why do you come for me to wed?
Can't even make your own corn grain
Single I am and will remain;
A lazy man I won't maintain."

He turned his back and walked away
Sayin', "Little miss you rue the day
You'll rue the day that you were born
For givin' me the devil cause I wouldn't hoe corn."You might also like
