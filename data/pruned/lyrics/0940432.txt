Shining through the darkness you turn my night to day (You turn my night to day)
You light me like a lighter and make my fire blaze (And make my fire blaze)

[Pre-Chorus]
Every little thing we do is just to prove to you how special you are how special you are
This is to show and prove to you, you know what you do, you know who you are
Girl, you's a star
