That we call the sweet forever
And we'll only reach that shore by faith's decree
One by one we'll gain the portals
There to dwell with the immortals
When they ring the golden bells for you and me

Don't you hear the bells now ringing?
Don't you hear the angels singing?
'Tis a glory hallelujah jubilee
In that far-off sweet forever
Just beyond the shining river
When they ring the golden bells for you and me

We shall know no sin nor sorrow
In that Heaven of tomorrow
When our bark shall sail beyond the silv'ry sea
We shall only know the blessing
Of our Father's sweet caressing
When they ring the golden bells for you and me

Don't you hear the bells now ringing?
Don't you hear the angels singing?
'Tis a glory hallelujah jubilee
In that far-off sweet forever
Just beyond the shining river
When they ring the golden bells for you and me
You might also likeWhen our days shall know their number
When in death we sweetly slumber
When the King commands the spirit to be free
Never more with anguish laden
We shall greet that lovely Eden
When they ring the golden bells for you and me
