'Cause you memory has stopped haunting me
My heart has quit aching and contantly breaking
For the first time in ages I'm free
This torch I've been carrying for you
Burned out a few seconds ago
Now I'm just a breeze in the calm maple tree
Outrside you window, hello
I'm over you, I'm over you
My prayers have been answered, my dreams have come true
After long years of tryin' and gradually dying
Right now I'm over you
I kept on believing you'd come back
But I've spent my last night alone
Oh, I see you sleeping and soon you'll be weeping
When they call and they tell you I'm gone
So I think I'll just keep on wanting you
Up into the cool morning sky
I wish you complete happiness
I forgoive you, God be with you, goodbye
I'm over you, I'm over you
My prayers have been answered and my dreams have come true
After long years of tryin' and finally flying
At last now now I'm over you...You might also like
