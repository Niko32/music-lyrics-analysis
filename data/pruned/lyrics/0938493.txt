Let your head by the edge of the sea
The bliss of the firefly swirling confusing
Distracts your mind will reach out to me

Dark you walk in celebration
Focus Orion the blink of an eye
Secretly charming the opus dictator
Erased like a cloud in the October sky

Walking talking chasing moments
Closing a gate in a passage of time
Ephemeral madness impression distortion
Return of your triumph in a nursery rhymeYou might also like
