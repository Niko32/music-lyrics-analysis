Shout out all my niggas, out there, on Earth

All of 'em, all them humans

Vaping in the kitchen, I ain't missing grub, and jamming money making mission in the midst of it

All in an instance from the shit to undismissable a fist full of wisdom and a message that'll let you know i'm still fucking listening to moments in existence, that were glistening, to me, plus all the homies in a plastic case

Wondering which snake in this basket would've saved the day or made it grey

Either way I made it with a notepad and no ink, go figure, old beats, fast rap, half cabs and don't think

Act first, ask, and then grab it. Dip faster than a madman in an Aston Martin running from a martian at a carnival

Bar spitting chronicles of our kind of art seen from mars on a star ship, ain't tryna start shit but rap like I started it

Up, I'm incarnate of my past self but smarter and quite a bit sharper due to carving out the purpose of this life and rewriting it

I'm a rare opportunity, walking with immunity, that hand to hand, two of me

Had it with us truthfully, little like I used to be, perceptually influenced by the knowledge that I chose to keep

Loosing heat, cooler than the coldest creep in Bouldin Creek, raising no stress temptations out the window
You might also likeAin't no indigo, but any ho could spot it yo, I gotta know it in and out the back and passed the, track that just had killed it skipped the cat and curiosity, fucked animosity, on top of it i'm honestly admonished in the moment, stop it honestly

Hooked off harmonics with a perfect fifth place just to ace it in this case suited truthfully, flowing back choosing which infusions of illusions cropped a eulogy and usually i'm used to it

The blue music mystery of histories existing in the midst of me




[Verse 2: Prometheus]


Prometheus, DFK

I'm often getting cautious in this coffin that I call my home, spitting something nauseous, drinking coffee on my velvet throne

Never been the boss, but the cost is what I had in mind, smoking something so divine, it'll turn you to a life of crime

Never clearly saw the signs to turn around before you die, I'd rather kick my feet up, spark something till i'm out of time

Out of rhymes i'll never be, stay out of my vicinity, before you get the remedy of shrooms and telepathy

My past is what I never tell, didn't have it very well, until I realized the green grass gives me red eyes

You should snort an eighth of me, always skating swankily, I'm safely erasing schemes to get back into first place
In the first place i'm behind, never getting out of line, I sold my soul for these rhymes, no surprises when I die

I'm fine when it comes to, the opposite of humble, I'm trying not to mumble and wake the wolves in the jungle
