Way back in the day
I used to stay out late
And I would dance the night away
I used to have time to kill
'Cause every day was long
The first to come, the last to leave
Before you came along
Well, I used to leave my house
And my clothes were always clean
And all these wrinkles on my face
You never would have seen
And every day my hair was done
And always makeup on
I used to fit into my jeans
Before you came along
But I never knew a little face
Could take a breath away
And who'd have thought one single smile
Was enough to make a day?
I never heard a laugh that sounded
Sweeter than a song
Before you came along
Well, once upon a time ago
I remember when
I used to be good company
For all of my friends
And when I'd go to bed
Well, I would sleep the whole night long
I'd never seen the sun come up
Before you came along
But I never knew a little face
Could take a breath away
And who'd have thought one single smile
Was enough to make a day?
I never heard a laugh that sounded
Sweeter than a song
Before you came along
Yeah, I never heard a laugh that sounded
Sweeter than a song
Before you came along
Before you came alongYou might also like
