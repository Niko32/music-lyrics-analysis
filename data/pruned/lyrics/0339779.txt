1, 2, 3, 4

[Chorus]
I am a tou-tou-tou tough, tough guy
I tell no tales, I do no lie
I am a tou-tou-tou-tou tough, tough guy
Halo ‘round my head to tough to die

[Verse 1]
Main attraction in a freak side show
Down in the basement where the cobwebs grow
On my last leg just getting by
Halo round my head too tough to die

[Verse 2]
Rainy days, rain cool wine
I'll scratch your back if you scratch mine
Hot sweat on my face
I feel like going out someplace

[Refrain]
Too tough to die
Too tough to die
Too tough to die
Too tough to die

I am a tou-tou-tou tough, tough guy
I tell no tales, I do no lie
I am a tou-tou-tou-tou tough, tough guy
Halo ‘round my head to tough to die
I am a tou-tou-tou tough, tough guy
I tell no tales, I do no lie
I am a tou-tou-tou-tou tough, tough guy
Halo ‘round my head to tough to die

[Verse 3]
Up late light my chocolate sweet
Down at the gym where the muscle boys meet
I am very nice guy very sincere
In real good shapeI have no fear

[Verse 4]
At the concert when the band comes on
I am in the ring where I belong
On my last leg just gettin' by
Halo round my head too tough to die

[Refrain]
Too tough to die
Too tough to die
Too tough to die
Too tough to die
[Chorus]
I am a tou-tou-tou tough, tough guy
I tell no tales, I do no lie
I am a tou-tou-tou-tou tough, tough guy
Halo ‘round my head to tough to die
I am a tou-tou-tou tough, tough guy
I tell no tales, I do no lie
I am a tou-tou-tou-tou tough, tough guy
Halo ‘round my head to tough to die
