Well its been a year and there so much to tell
Been doing alright in spite of myself
Just wish I could stop feeling bad when I pray

[Chorus 1]
But I know I'm going to get there someday

[Verse 2]
Got that job I was dreaming about
Sometimes its tough traveling around
But who I want to be still seems so far away

[Chorus 1]

[Verse 3]
Glad I told you all I meant to
While I had the chance
Cause every moment I had with you
Made me who I am

By the way, I met someone new
And wouldn't you know, she's a whole lot like you
Still I ain't ready to settle down in one place

[Chorus 1]
You might also like[Verse 4]
Well I guess I'll be moving on
I'll just leave these daisies by your stone
And momma, I still miss you every day

[Chorus 1]
