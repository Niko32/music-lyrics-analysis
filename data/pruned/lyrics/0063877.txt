I know this beautiful young thing, around 16..
Takes her chances and makes choices off of dreams and things
Mama do her best to help her, and she makes it very clear..
But all she wanted was her ear
You see, it was a push of maturation
Close to graduation
When she stumbled up and fell a victim to infatuation
It was just a young mistake, it's somethin we be known for
But Mama saw it different, made her feel like she was wrong for it
And I ain't in to justifyin sides
But a parents there to help, despite her underlyin pride
But baby girl ain't get it, so the young inside her died
And now she flamin up the loud to confide

[Hook]
Cause she was just young
Misunderstood
Not dumb, but in the hood
It's no love for all the children
So we..
We hit the homie up, in lieu of our luck..
Escape our pain for the sawbuck..

[Verse 2]
I'm just this ignorant young thing, no longer 16
And the world is evil and they out to get me
Accordin to my mama, yeah thats somethin that she clear about
..but I just need for her to hear me out
See I'm not this asshole who chose sittin on my ass
Over tryna make some moves and gettin to my fuckin classes
Tell her everyday I'm on the grind fasho
She tell me I'm wastin my time and it's time to go..
Back to your lessons, so I can hit the lecture hall
I'm better off popppin ziplocs of adderall
She so impatient, tick tocks corrode her
Won't appreciate this new wrist watch I stole her
Guess not
My father wants his son to make it major
But can't seem to release his inner hatred for his neighbor
I couldn't do school, felt a victim of my age..
And when I called HIS ass a fool, I fell victim to his rage
And I ain't into justifyin sides
But my parents should be helpin, fuck they underlyin pride
They haven't, and awhile ago, the young inside me died
Now I'm flamin up the loud to confide
You might also likeCause shit, I'm just young
Misunderstood
Not dumb, but in the hood
It's no love for all the children
And muhfuckas say that it can kill me, I don't give no fuck..
Escape my pain for the sawbuck x2

I'm just this ignorant young thing..
