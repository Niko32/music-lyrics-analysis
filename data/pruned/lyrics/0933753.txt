Here I am fallin' again
In places that I've already been
I sure didn't plan it and I don't understand it
But here I am fallin' again

[Verse 2]
Here I am lyin' again
Making up places that I've never been
I thought I was through with these heartbreaking blues
But here I am lyin' again

[Verse 3]
Why don't a man ever take
Time to think what is at stake?
Is it the danger or the pleasurable stranger?
But those are the chances we'll take

[Verse 4]
I'd hate to come face to face
With her and her at the same place
'Cause it will be hell If I had to tell her
Someone has taken her place

[Verse 5]
I had a beautiful wife
She found it all out one night
And the pleasurable stranger, lord I didn't change her
And I lost it all this time

So here I am cryin' again
And callin' for sympathy from my old friends
He once loved her and she once him
And here I am cryin' again
