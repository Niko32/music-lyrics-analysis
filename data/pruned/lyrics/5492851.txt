Look, woo

[Chorus: Pop Smoke]
Look (Woo)
I'm downtown Chicago, on Michigan Ave with Polo and we on some woo shit (Woo shit)
I walk into Saks Fifth with a bad bitch and we both feelin’ ruthless (Ruthless)
If I see a opp in the spot, I look him in his face like, "You ain't gon' do shit" (Nah)
Saucin’ (Saucin'), too lit (Too lit)
Headshot (Headshot), clueless (Clueless)

[Post-Chorus: Fivio Foreign & Pop Smoke]
They fell in love with the movement
I see a opp and I'm boomin' (Boaw, woo, boaw)
You get the money, it come with confusion
Don't try to teach me, nigga, I know what I'm doin' (Ayy, ayy)
Fivi (Fivi), uh (Uh), she saw me and started droolin' (Woo)
Big dope (Big dope), boofin’ (Boofin’)
Snowflake (Snowflake), coolin' (Ayy, ayy, ayy)

[Verse 1: Fivio Foreign]
I get the money and dip, huh
I don’t go to war 'less I'm fully equipped, uh
Everywhere I go, I'm good with a bitch, yeah, look (Ayy, ayy)
I got a fast whip (Uh)
Shooter shootin’, then he pass grip, uh
Don't say you smokin' on my niggas (Nah), 'cause that be your last spliff (Bitch)
Hitter with me, he do mad hits (Ayy)
Turned my bitch into a bad bitch
Dropped a song and I got mad lit
All I did was give 'em ad-libs, ayy, ayy, ayy
Too rough, we know how to play, uh

I make them bitches go out of they way, Fivi
