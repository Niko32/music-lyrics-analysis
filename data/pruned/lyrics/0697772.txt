First Verse - Rise Rashid
Mommas gonna suffer
These Cops is killing kids and these kids killing each other
A lot is undercover, baby suffocated patiently waiting up in that back seat, in that heat, I bet that he is....
So I can't turn the other cheek tho
Cuz these people are foul and now they shooting us like a free throw
I don't chill with none of my equals
Cuz every weapon is lethal
And really the odds are higher of getting killed by one of my people
We so caught up in all the news feeds
The news feeds foolery
The Music is so polluted the fools is telling us what it's cool to be
Schools ain't improving, if we ain't losing then we soon to be
Pools of blood oozing up in the street
But you can't see that we....
That Young'n had a dream
Now he won't grow to see them fruits or none of what that means
And he won't grow to groom a queen or none of what that brings
The pun intended for Martin Luther's shooter to kill a King
But I am standing up on that balcony like Malcolm at that podium
Watching all the alchemy, and all of the pandemonium
It's lonely in the zone I'm in
Feeling like Napoleon
Small but I am part of a bigger picture that's eye opening

Waring your heart like a stolen dream
Opening the sky with your broken keys
No one can blind us any longer...
Repeat 3x

Second verse - Rise Rashid
Sleeping beauty, cutie like Rudy Husktable
Booty post in Instagram, who is that that touched her tho
Grown ass man, waiting for his que to go
Double tapping and planning so he can push up like a cuticle
Student tho, judy judging even though she doing the most
Shoot him a text to let him know, "meet me after the school close"
Seems like you ready, he ain't ready to be no daddy tho
Now ya stomach growing up under the baggy clothes I bet that she is...
That Young'n had a dream
Now she gotta raise a princess even tho she's not yet a queen
Best friend of a diamond but absent is the ring
See the pun intended Diana's accident to kill a queen
But I am one in a million like Aliyah on that Plane
So I'm gonna rock the boat until Columbus feel that pain
Of every slave that he carried
Tell Harriet I'm rolling
Running the underground, coming to take back them dreams stolen

Chorus
Waring your heart like a stolen dream
Opening the sky with your broken keys
No one can blind us any longer...
Repeat 3x
