Love King
Love King forever
My heart has chosen
And that's all I know

[Verse 1]
I never meant to confuse you
I never meant to complicate your life (complicate your life)
For loving matters of the heart
Being stuck in a triangle of emotion
Itâ€™s one thing to want somebody (versus)
Another thing to need somebody (versus)
And another thing to love somebody
My situation is

[Pre-Hook]
All I know is that I love ya
Love you like you love him
Like I've never loved another
That's all I know
It's kinda crazy that you love him
Love him like I love ya
I love you like I never loved nobody
And all I know
You might also like[Hook]
My heart has chosen
My heart is choosing you
My heart is choosing, that's all I know
My heart has chosen
My heart is choosing
My heart is choosing you
My heart is choosing
That's all I know

[Verse 2]
That night we laid down as friends
We graduated to lovers
You changed my heart and ways forever
Now we're stuck in this triangle of emotion (caught up)
It was one thing to want somebody (versus)
Another thing to need somebody (versus)
And another thing to love somebody
And all I know

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook] (x2)

[Bridge]
Oh yeah
There's no turning back now that my heart has chosen you
Oh no, no no
And all I know is baby
[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]
