The bright lights of the city are a pretty sight to see
Perhaps they're extra pretty to a country girl like me
Temptation waits at every turn and it won't let me be
So mama when you pray tonight
Say a special prayer for me

[Chorus]
I miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding
The good-night kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding
So mama when you pray tonight
And while you're on your knees
Mama say a special prayer for me

[Verse 2]
The nights get cold and lonely
When you're far away from home
And lonely makes it easy for a good girl to go wrong
Evil eyes search through the night for lonely girls like me
So mama when you pray tonight
Say a special prayer for me

[Chorus]
I miss your tender good-night kiss of love and understanding
The good-night kisses I get now are cruel and so demanding
So mama when you pray tonight
And while you're on your knees
Mama say a special prayer for meYou might also like
