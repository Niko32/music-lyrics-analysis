Even though I'mma beginner, im already a masta
I hear u can rap fast, but I can rap fasta
Pak attack if u didn't know, I own everything of urs, including ur ho
I put everything on, like I put on a show
So hear, why dont u check my flow
New shit, nbs, no bull shit/when im done, ill have this game head
But I hear hip hops dead
Well good, its time for rap step ahead
Listen up cuz I ain't finnish
I speak the truth, but I guess to you it's a foreign language
I eat posers for dinner, I spit them out like fruit
Thorw em out like a poor mans garbage
White belt or black belt, novice or expert
Dosent matter, this is just an excerpt
The future is near, no need to fear
Jump on this bandwagon, pack ur bags, this ride will never endYou might also like
