Let me sit on your porch, let me drink a beer
Let me scratch that hound dog's ear
Let me rock in your rocking chair

[Chorus:]
Gimme peace, gimme peace, gimme peace

[Verse 2:]
Show me your garden, I love to hoe
Let me walk in a fertile row
I got some seeds that I'd like to sow

[Chorus]

[Verse 3:]
And when that evening sun goes down
Drive me into your hometown
Let me buy your friends a round

[Chorus]

[Verse 4:]
Let me drink water from your well
Tell me a story that you'd like to tell
I think you'll find that I'll listen well
You might also like[Chorus]

[Verse 5:]
When you've had all of me that you can take
Say so long with a strong handshake
Don't get to drinkin' and ask me to stay

[Chorus]

[Verse 5:]
And when that evening sun goes down
Drive me into your hometown
I'll catch that next truck outward-bound

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
