His head turned and my heart jumped
When I saw that it was him
After two long years the love of my life
And I just held my breath in
Standing there smiling
With his eyes locked on mine
He couldn't hear me screaming on the inside

When I said, tear don't you fall
He's gone let him go
Eye's don't look back
Down that empty road
And lips you may move
But don't you say too much
Oh and please, please heart hush

I said something stupid
And reached out my hand
After making love and moving earth
We were shaking hands
A million sweet memories pin-balled through my brain
The want to hold him one more time
Ran through my veins

When I said, tear don't you fall
He's gone let him go
Eye's don't look back
Down that empty road
And lips you may move
But don't you say too much
Oh and please, please heart hush
You might also likeI kept looking at my watch
Like I had somewhere to be
Then he stopped talking
And kissed me tenderly

And I said, tear don't you fall
He's gone let him go
Eye's don't look back
Down that empty road
And lips you may move
But don't you say too much
Oh and please, please heart hush
Oh and please, please heart hush
