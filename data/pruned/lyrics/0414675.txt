Ain't nobody sicker, I'm the deadliest virus
I deserve to win this shit
If I don't, fuck Hi-Rez...fuck Hi-Rez...fuck Hi-rez
I deserve to win this shit
If I don't, fuck Hi-Rez

[Verse:1]

Ok, wait a second
Let me make just one correction
I'm the best to ever do it
Sex, Rap, you'll always be a second
Ain't nobody in my section
Goin harder than erections
Hater comments misconceptions
Understand I'm never threatened
Use my lyrics as my weapons
Grindin, ya'll on the fences
Takin shots just like injections
Rap addict, no intervention
I get more neck than a necklace
Fuck the beat with no protection
Watch me blow up like projections
Flow ill, it's got an infection
It'll wrap around your throat and leave your ass straight up breahtless
"He killed it!," you should expect it
Study beats, let me dissect it
301, I gotta rep it
"Whose the winner," ain't a question
Man, fuck Hi-Rez if it ain't me he selectin, bitchYou might also like
