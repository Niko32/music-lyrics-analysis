And it got so bad, I knew I had to leave
But halfway down the highway
When I turned around and saw
My little girl a running after me

Crying, daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow me down
Some 'cause you're making me run
Daddy, don't you walk so fast

It broke my heart to tell my little baby
That her daddy had to run and catch a train
She had no way of knowing
I was leaving home for good
I turned around and there she was again

Crying, daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow me down
Some 'cause you're making me run
Daddy, don't you walk so fast

Only for the sake of my sweet daughter
I just had to turn back home
Right there and then
I try to start a new life with the mother of my child
I couldn't bear to hear those words again

Daddy, don't you walk so fast
Daddy, slow me down
Some 'cause you're making me run
Daddy, don't you walk so fast
