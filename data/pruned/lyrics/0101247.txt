I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Verse One: Jose Grands]

I'm on some other shit
Like fuck the government
Get bitch slapped and I make yo' ho suck a dick
We on some huntin' shit, looking for deer meat
Got nigga's run, duck 'n hide, you ain't near street
Everybody knows whose nice with the flows
You can't get street cred just cause you got nice clothes
I can get psycho, this shit's a cycle
And blind nigga's, y'all can't see me like I'm micro
Late night, but I'm up on your ass like I'm Michael
And straight knife you
Then lacerate across your fucking windpipe tubes
No one likes you, lets get it right, dude
Got nigga's mic food
Fuck them niggas, I be going for the kill
But I ain't got the bill
When my shit drops that's another propeasil
Put 'em in the way, I'ma eat 'em like a meal
Them nigga's ain't real
You your own fan, you invest in your deals
So who do you appeal?
Living for the moment just to catch you a thrill
Couple days later you'll be going downhill

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand

[Verse Two: Jose Grands]

Watch the effect, this gon' fall like a domino
With a bad bitch and she look like a Navaho
And in her purse you know she always keep that calico
Fuck what ya heard, it's 'bout to be another Alamo
I beat the dead horse then I ash you where your saddle go
I'm pretty sure by now, that you know I got a battle flow
So if you think about contesting, you know where that'll go
Nigga's straight ass with they motherfucking gimmick flows
Well I'm here to fuck up your plans, and mix the chemicals
Hang with a bunch of goons and most of them nigga's criminals
Crazy individuals, don't give a fuck 'bout principals
Nigga, I feel invincible, these motherfuckers fictional
You smoking home grown, while we smokin' on medicinal
MMA, put a lock on yo' ass and then submission you
You watching dopey digital, get your 3D glasses
It's gettin' critical
[Hook]

I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
I'm going in for the kill
I'm doing it for a thrill
I'm hoping you'll understand
And not let go of my hand
