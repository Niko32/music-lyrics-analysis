(oohs)
In the night when the moon is clear
You my dear are very near and so warm
Like a hot summer day late in june

Remember when we were so young
We thought that everything was fun
But really life had just begun

I never want to leave you
I never want to go
I just want to be beside you
Everywhere you go
I never want to leave you
I never want to go
I just want to be beside you
Everywhere you go

Remember when we were so young
We thought that everything was fun
But really life had just begun

And I never want to leave you
I never want to go
I just want to be beside you
Everywhere you go
I never want to leave you
I never want to go
I just want to be beside you
Everywhere you go
