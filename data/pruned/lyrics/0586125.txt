You're my, you're my canvas lying naked
Let me paint a perfect picture for you baby
And I wanna hold you, gently lady
Then I'll keep you wake with every stroke I'm makin'

[Chorus 1]
When you feel me in between your legs
I'm pulling on your hair
I'll back up all the things I said
That I whispered in your ear
All on your body with my lips baby
And every bit of me
Will satisfy that's what you've been craving
Fulfill our fantasies

[Bridge]
When I get you alone
Maybe I can't wait till I get you alone

[Verse 2]
This is danger, this is crazy
You're the inspiration for this piece I'm paintin'
And I should know you like this baby
You're my best kept secret
My addiction, save me
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Cause baby we be fucking on the bed
I'm pulling on your hair
I'll back up all the things I said
That I whispered in your ear
All on your body with my lips, baby
And every bit of me
Will satisfy that's what you've been craving
Fulfill our  fantasies

[Bridge]

[Outro]  (x2)
Can you feel it?
(I got you open babe)
Can you feel it?
(You make me feel some type of way)
Can you feel it?
(There's something more than physical)
