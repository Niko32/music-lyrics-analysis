So what I was gonna tell you was—
Love you Barbra!
Thank you honey. 

In 1967, some of you remember, may have been even there, I did a concert in Central Park. And that show gave me such stage fright because I forgot the words to one of my songs. And it, it so frightened me that I didn't return to the concert stage, as some of you know, for twenty-seven years, on New Year's Eve 1994. Thank you. But I wanted to challenge myself, you know, to see if I could do it, face the fear. And when that tour was done I said to myself, that's it, you know, no more. 

But then I found from time to time that I was drawn back to the concert stage because you guys really make it very gratifying for me, you really do. Thanks. 

You're the best!
Don't get hoarse. 

Anyway, if I've learned anything, it's to never say never. Because it ain't over 'til the fat lady sings and I ain't that fat. 

You're gorgeous. 
Thank you. 
You're still hot, Barbra. 
Oh, that was a good one! I like that one. That was very good. 

Anyway, life goes by so fast, doesn't it? You know, one minute you're a child. The next you're a teenager. The next you're a parent. And then you're looking back on all of it, and it really makes me wonder. You might also like
