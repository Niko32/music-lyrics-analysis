And need is all you have
Left out in the dark alone
To see what you're made of

Nobody gives a hand
When you're in deepest pain
Crying both your eyes out
And swallow all your pride

I'm longing for the day
That you return to me again
And see me in the brightest light
That you have ever seen

With my heart open wide
To love you once again
Like I have done before
But you chose to ignore

I'll wait here for evermore
I'll wait here forever and ever more
I'll wait here until you return to me
I'll wait here for evermore

The path to me is winding
But you will always notice
Some presence of me around
When you want to see
You might also likeThere will be a time
That we will never part
For this is my biggest gift to you:
We were never two
