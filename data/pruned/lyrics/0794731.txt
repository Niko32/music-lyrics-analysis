Staying in is all I wanna do
And I get stars like you
Disease and tobacco free

Cabin fever hands won't ever freeze
Poppy eyes are beaming gasoline
And I'm so bored, baby
Disease and tobacco free

Stolen coal, your eyes are blazing blue
Staying in is all we oughta do
'Cause I see stars, light beams
Disease and tobacco free
Disease and tobacco free
