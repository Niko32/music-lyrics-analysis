Babe, got nothing but a losing hand
Yeah, the way you treat me, babe
Oh, it's like the shifting desert sand

Baby, yeah, and you would be my queen

Yeah, the way you treat me, babe
I don't believe I'll ever understand
The way you treat me babe

Gambling on your loving, baby, got a losing hand, yeah, babe
