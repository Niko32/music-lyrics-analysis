The race is won, a feat for man
80 days since it all began
Crowds are cheering for Phileas Fogg
Mice are dancing with cats and dogs

For he has proved with a positive mind
The world is yours and all mankind
Can live together and be as one
As the universe is, we are just one sun

In every nation

The meek and the gentle shall inherit the earth
So live your dream for all it's worth
And don't forget to shoot for the stars
