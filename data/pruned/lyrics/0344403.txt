Folks call me a maverick, guess I ain't too diplomatic
I just never been the kind to go along
Just avoidin' confrontation, for the sake of conformation
And I'll admit I tend to sing a different song
But sometimes you just can't be afraid to wear a different hat
If Columbus had complied this old world might still be flat
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain

[Verse 2]
Well, I've been accused of makin' my own rules
There must be rebel blood just a-runnin' through my veins
But I ain't no hypocrite, so what you see is what you get
And that's the only way I know to play the game
Ol' Noah took much ridicule for buildin' his great ark
But after forty days and forty nights he was lookin' pretty smart
Sometimes it's best to brave the wind and rain
By havin' strength to go against the grain

[Guitar/Fiddle Solos]

[Verse 3]
Hell, there's more folks than a few who share my point of view
But they're worried If they're gonna sink or swim
They'd like to buck the system, but the deck is stacked against 'em
And they are a little scared to go out on a limb
But if you're gonna make a difference, if you're gonna leave your mark
You can't follow like a bunch of sheep, you gotta listen to your heart
Go bustin' in like old John Wayne
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain
You might also like[Outro]
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain
