But now you've gone and left me, I'm so blue
I believe in you, darling that your heart would be true
But now you've gone and left me I'm so blue

Our vows have been broken, you have proven untrue
Another has my sweetheart and the love that I once knew
I believe in you darling that your heart would be true
But now you've gone and left me I'm so blue

Oh, the nights are so lonely, dreams of you haunt me so
What's happened little darling, I don't know
I believe in you darling that your heart would be true
But now you've gone and left me I'm so blueYou might also like
