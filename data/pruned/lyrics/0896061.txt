Of all rejected creatures unloved
Of all who defy the predestination
That divides mankind
Into the saved and damned
He was the first

[Verse 2]
The lurking punishment with blood he did reveal death
And trough the ages run a river deep and red
The ever present heirs for whom there is no rest

[Chorus]
And he shall walk in empty places
With a claim on destiny and self at hand
An endless journey towards the rising sun

[Bridge]
Towards the rising sun

[Verse 3]
"Remember this, you others;
The fire and the fury
The strength and defiance
This you admire, this you desire
I had to win them for myself"

In remembrance of the adversary
I conjure up the lion will:
Hungered
Violent
Solitary
Godless
