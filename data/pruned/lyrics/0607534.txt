Top speed racing better keep out my way
Got fiends aching so the deep route I play
Can’t relate with you if ain't no type of great in you
Take the view at heights with gods is all I'm in a race to do
Each step gives quakes a cue pure bass shaking through
Big return from more than two decades of all this bass is due
Heed the quote since that's how I feed the folk need to note
August first 88 my mom pushed out 4 keys of coke
Fucking right she still wanting all her proper profit
Plus more often clock in mach you copy not with
Ain’t the same with most lane approaches curve I hit the gas
Bitch you wish this whip would crash watch these pistons mash hey hey

[Hook]
Bitch I can't be stopped, bitch I can't be stopped
So you better keep out my way, bitch I can't be stopped
(x2)

Southside nigga we riding, fuck your breaks I'm sliding
(I can't be stopped)
(x4)


[Verse 2]
On a mission to make all my competition feel disrespected
Anytime my feet hit the section they standing in pissed and vexed with
The essence my presence provides get despised when I'm met with eyes deadly kind
Matter fact take that a little bit further till every time
My arrival makes rivals suicidal rather be dead than to let me shine
And witness it grip quick get dismissed wish your gift could sit next to mine
Make you hate success as much as I hated the struggle I had to get it
Then throw salt to wounds and serve pipe to your wife with delight just to add to debit
Have that bitch straight slurping up everything I'm squirting up like I paid her
Tell burp it for later jus savor my flavor you trade her
Those cute little kisses your misses eat this dick so great
Hope my name taste like my nut every time you speak that shit with hate hoe

[Verse 3]
I woke up today with no question bout my progression
Steps been etched in this mind for this quest in which I'm finessing
Stretching till I'm at the best and no less than complete perfection
Pressing passed any of the stressing that might be testing my blessings
Colder mold who shoulders hold a boulder swole as mine
Not too sure you'll find bulldoze over those opposing mine
Closing time for your shop quick if you not stocked with that shit that's matching up
Got lip cause I feel I fit top pick and I always back it up
My creep still out runs you why peak all this hunger I keep
Makes me wonder what my teeth my feast my feats
Got me feeling that your ceiling's a floor at my feet
I seek just what's really in store when willing to soar where you can't quite reach
Still I mash the gas to always show what niggas should know
Ain’t no type of rigamaro they could deliver that's big enough for
A rig that's driven to go give them a got damn riveting show
Foes my feelings are frigid below the digit of 0 bitch I got no brakes

[Hook]
