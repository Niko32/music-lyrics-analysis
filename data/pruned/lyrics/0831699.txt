Hold on, my people (Ooh, you gotta hang on now, girl)
Hold on, my people (When it gets real rough, rocky, and windy)
Hold on, my people (Hold on)
Hold on, my people (On and on and on now)
Hold on, my people (When they start throwin' fire)
Hold on, my people (Chant, chant, chant you down now)
Hold on, my people (Oh, you got to hold on and on)
Hold on, my people (Ooh, you got to hold on now, hey, hey)

Hold on, my people (Love is on the way, love is on the way)
Hold on, my people (Love is on the way, ooh)
Hold on, my people (Don't let it go now, hey)
Hold on, my people (Oh, even when your heart starts bleeding)
Hold on, my people (Hand on the trigger now, y'all)
Hold on, my people (Right now, my brothers and sisters)
Hold on, my people (Keep on moving, keep on moving)
Hold on, my people (Keep on moving on)
