Well it's flooding  down in Texas
All the telephone lines are down
I said it's flooding down in Texas
All the telephone lines are down
I been trying to call my baby
Can't get a single sound
Well the dark clouds are rolling
And I'm standing out in the rain
I said the dark clouds are rolling
And I'm standing out in the rain
Muddy water keep on rolling
It's about to drive me insane
Well I'm leaving you baby
And I'm going back home to stay
Well I'm leaving you baby
And I'm going back home to stay
Where there ain't no floods and tornados
And the sun shines every dayYou might also like
