I know you don't mean to be mean to me
'Cause when you want to, you can make me feel like we belong
We belong
Lately, you make me feel all I am is a back-up plan
I say I'm done and then you smile at me and I forget
Everything I said

[Pre-Chorus]
I buy into those eyes
And into your lies

[Chorus]
You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't

[Verse 2]
I wish you were where you're supposed to be, close to me
But here I am just staring at this candle burning out
There's still no sound

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Of footsteps on my stairs
Or your voice anywhere
You might also like[Chorus]
You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You say you'll call, but I know you
You say you're coming home, but I know you
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
You say you'll call, but I know you won't
