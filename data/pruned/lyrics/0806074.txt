Spoon upon ice-cream and cherry
And take the cloth and wipe your chin
Go walking through the clinic door
How can you eat like that?
Tender Kinder Baby
Swallow down the sacred liquor
And swoon upon the matron's tongue
Inside her mouth you turn the handle
And they run indoors into the number one position
How can you dance like that?
Tender Kinder Baby
From the mud into the sandpit
Round and round the matron goes
Down upon your knees to beg the question
Down upon your knees and how can you commit this act of contrition?
Tender Kinder Baby
You'll spoon upon ice-cream and cherry
And take the cloth and wipe your chin
Go walking through the clinic door
How can you dance like that?
How can you dance like that?
How can you eat like that?
Tender Kinder Baby
How can you breathe like that?
Tender Kinder Baby
