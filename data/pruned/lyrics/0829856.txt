It's a mystery
How the heart beats
How the sun shines
How our eyes meet
It's a mystery
It's a wonder
How we keep from
Sinking under
It's a mystery

[Verse 2]
All the nonsense
Set before us
Supposed to shock us
But it bores us
All the ennui
All the replays
All the rewrites
All the "can't says"
It's a mystery

[Bridge]
Electron guns fire images
They end in interstellar space
Within the year
And through it all
We dance and starve and
Burn and clear
You might also like[Verse 3]
It's a mystery
How they con us
How they sneak 'til
They're upon us
All the anchors
With their helmets
Getting ratings
With their zealots

[Verse 4]
All the pundits
All the salesmen
Setting snake oil
To the nation
All the specials
Every rerun
All the penguins
Getting well-done
It's a mystery

[Verse 5]
It's a mystery
How the heart beats
How the sun shines
How our eyes meet
It's a mystery
It's a wonder
How we ever
Find each other
It's a mystery
