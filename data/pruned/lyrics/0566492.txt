Oh
Oh, I love throwin' up
Was thrownin' up (no)
Okay, be careful
Watch yourself
Hey

[Chorus]
I was throwin' up on a Tuesday
I think it's 'cause I ate too much food, hey
I was throwin' up on a Tuesday
I think it's 'cause I ate too much food, hey

[Verse 1]
It's Halloween
Don't eat too much candy
Share it with your friends
Unless you have no friends

[Chorus]
I was throwin' up on a Tuesday
I think it's 'cause I ate too much food, hey
I was throwin' up on a Tuesday
I think it's 'cause I ate too much food, hey

Chew your food good
So it digests real easy
It's so easy
Just move your teeth
And you won't be

[Chorus]
Throwin' up on a Tuesday
I threw up 'cause I ate too much food, hey
I was throwin' up on a Tuesday
And I did it 'cause I ate too much food, hey
I was throwin' up
