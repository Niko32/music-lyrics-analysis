And you'd never once looked back at your home across the track
You're the gossip of the town but my heart can still be found
Where you tossed it on the ground pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down when you're blue and all alone
When their glamour starts to bore you come on back where you belong
You may be their pride and joy but they'll find another toy
Then they'll take away your crown pick me up on your way down
[ fiddle - steel ]
They have changed your attitude made you haughty and so rude
Your new friends can take the blame underneath you're still the same
When you've learned these things are true I'll be waiting here for you
As you tumble to the ground pick me up on your way down
Pick me up on your way down...You might also like
