Can you look into my face
And see the change that has taken place?
Can you tell, can you tell I love you
From the look in my eyes? (Look in my eyes)

[Verse 2]
I'm not sure my feelings show
Maybe you'd be the last to notice the change
Can you tell I love you
From the look in my eyes? (Lookin in my eyes)

[Bridge]
From the look in my eyes
Do you know how badly I want to tell you all about it?
There's a smile that I can't hide
Because loving you the way I do
Makes me feel good inside

[Verse 3]
Even if we never touch
If you knew, it would mean so much to me
Can you tell, do you see?
Can you tell I love you
From the look in my eyes?

[Verse 3]
Can you tell, do you see?
Can you tell I love you
From the look in my eyes? (Look in my eyes)

[Outro]
Look in my eyes (Look in my eyes)
Look in my eyes (Look in my eyes)
Look in my eyes (Look in my eyes)
Look in my eyes (Look in my eyes)
