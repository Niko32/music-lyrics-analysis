SHOWGIRL: Nervous?
MEG: Just a bit
SHOWGIRLS: Kid, look who you are!
The headline act!
A major star!
You're already a hit
(Got a match?)
MEG: Wonder what he'll think...
SHOWGIRL: The boss?
MEG: If he's even here
SHOWGIRLS: Honey please... He's here
And in just two days
He'll be there tossing you bouquets
At our gala premiere
Picture it!
The cream of Manhattan!
Celebrities! Millionaires!
Watching you!
MEG: I'll be waiting in the wing
Wound up tighter than a spring
As the house begins to dim
And I'll practice every line
Hoping desperately to shine
Shining only for him
SHOWGIRLS: Just imagine how they'll cheer
At the moment you appear
MEG: Stepping out before the scrim...!
Let them whoop and let 'em call
I won't hear the crowd at all...
SHOWGIRLS: No, it's only for him
MEG: Tell me how I look
SHOWGIRL: Fine
MEG: Just fine? What about my hair?
SHOWGIRL: Beautiful
MEG: You swear?
SHOWGIRLS: Trust me, once the boss
Sees how you put that song across
Hell, he ain't got a prayer
MEG: You mean it?
SHOWGIRLS: You'll step out into the light
Looking lovely!
Burning bright!
All vitality and vim!
MEG: Ah-Ahh...!
And I'll rapturously float
Through the melody he wrote
Singing only for him
SHOWGIRLS: And before the music dies
Up the audience will rise
Nearly bursting at the brim!
And you'll stand there in the glow...
MEG: And perhaps, at last he'll know...
SHOWGIRL: Girls! Hurry up! We're on!
ONLOOKERS: (Where is she?) (Look! There!)
(In the center!) (Just like in the posters!)
(It's the Ooh La La Girl!) (Meg Giry!)
MEG: Welcome each and everyone
To our firmament of fun!
SHOWGIRLS: A buffet of Ballyhoo!
MEG & SHOWGIRLS: It's where Coney comes to play
And it's opening today!
MEG: And it's only for you!
SHOWGIRLS: And you!
And you!
And you!
MEG & SHOWGIRLS: Entertainment day and night
Sure to dazzle and delight!
MEG: And of course we'll be there too!
MEG: & SHOWGIRLS: We're so happy that you're here
For the season's big premiere!
And it's only for you!You might also like
