Patience is a virtue,that's the motto, no drake
Stay creating, an innovating, Never follow trends
She gets in my way, we never communicate
Listen to what she says
Cause her presence seems great
But actions speak louder status's of road runners
This will never be, without trust placed, in the foundation
To gain back, is so rough, tough couldn't bare the pain
Instant intense migraine
Young souls want quick love
Slow touches and night flings
Don't be,that guy,who analyzes everything
Question tangents, lowered for another time
Oak said There's a time an a place
Just know,when the point comes
The right one, shows up
Everything that happens, there's always reason
Take it as lesson or stay grieving....over thinking
Got a question an

A Passive, nice guy, keep it so cool, like an igloo
Pay no attention, to the negative,impeccable thoughts
Bump worries, in search for,a significant, other who don't play games
Like play station,to obtain, higher grace
Endless chase,messing with, a brother configuration
Repetition no scams,not needed
Double dees, to the fifth I plea
Diggers be searching for gold,you never asked for,no Money favors
Lost in her eyes,figure and headlights, like a helpless infant (so nice)
Personality is DTE, she so mahogany, no rakim
Lately, I've been, having suspicions
Busy constantly, efforts made through phone calls
Actions with a face confrontations, stay minimal
Family before everything, discussions With friends
Explanation,calling me your bf
Asked you in person,what we are
Just friends, feels like I wasted time
