I can't look at your face, but I cannot look away
Direct my gaze
Guide my steps
Clear my sight
Free my tongue
To speak Your name
Angels in the air I breathe, angels, listen to my prayer
Angels breathe the air we see, there's an angel beside you there
It says your name, its hand reaches out, it touches your headYou might also like
