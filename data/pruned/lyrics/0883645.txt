Let's walk across the river of time
I would cherish you forever
Like a diamond, our love will shine

From the sea to the burning desert
I have looked but I could not find
A love that could not bring such pleasure
As you do, precious girl of mine

And when it's all said and done
I know that you're the only one
I need in this certain way
And as we go on and on
My love for you keeps growing strong
And this is all I have to say

Let's cross this bridge together
You and I for the rest of our days

Let's cross this bridge of laughter
Let's cross this bridge of tears
Let's cross this bridge together
You just call, I will be near

The sun is slowly falling
The night will soon be set
There is no time for stalling
Come to your lover, come to your friend
You might also likeWhen it's all said and done
I know that you're the only one
I need in this certain way
As we go on and on
My love for you keeps growing strong
And this is all I have to say

Let's cross this bridge together
You and I for the rest of our days
You and I for the rest of our days

Let's cross this bridge of laughter
Let's cross this bridge of tears
Let's cross this bridge together
You just call, I will be near
