I know she must have cut you deep
She's gone but you won't let her leave
I know your heart has not healed yet
But sometimes I think that you forget

[Chorus]
That wasn't me, that wasn't me
I'm not the one who made love bring you to your knees
You can't love if you can't trust, her memory's hurt you long enough
Let your heart see that wasn't me

[Verse 2]
I can no longer pay the price
For damage done by her careless lies
We can't move on 'til you let go
I always thought by now you'd know

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Oh you can't love if you can't trust, her memory's hurt you long enough
Let your heart see that wasn't meYou might also like
