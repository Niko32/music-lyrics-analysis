When she walk
Through My door
Karma can be a
Bitch You Know

Karma I 'm sorry
For Karma

For leaving your
Heart out to shore

Karma I can't take
It anymore
Karma
I got just what
I
Paid for
KARMA

When she walk through
My door

Karma can be a bitch
You Know
Karma Your all I'm living
For
Karma
Don't you hurt me
Anymore

Is like
Fighting a Cold
War

Way back to
Shore
