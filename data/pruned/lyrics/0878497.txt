The snow falls round my window
But it can't chill my heart
God knows it died the day you left
My dream world fell apart

[Chorus]
The weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' so long
These blues have got me cryin'
Oh sweet daddy, please come home

[Verse]
Through tears, I watch young lovers
As they go strolling by
Oh all the things that might have been
God forgive me, if I cry

[Chorus]
The weary blues from waitin'
Lord, I've been waitin' so long
These blues have got me cryin'
Oh sweet daddy, please come homeYou might also like
