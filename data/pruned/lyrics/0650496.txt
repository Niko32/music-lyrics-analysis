Waiting on you I'm not going to
I won't be waiting on you no more
Waiting on you I'm not going to
I won't be waiting on you no more

[Verse 1]
I know you're getting tired of what I put you through
But it's not the same way that's what I used to do
And now I want you back so girl, I've changed my ways
Please stop frontin' on me why you wanna do me this way

[Pre-Chorus]
I can take it (Oh yeah)
I can fake it
I won't be playin' no more

[Chorus]
Waiting on you I'm not going to
I won't be waiting on you no more
Waiting on you I'm not going to
I won't be waiting on you no more

[Verse 2]
Why can't you just believe that things are different now
I'll do whatever it takes, let me show you how
There will never be no other girl for me
Just give me one more chance, you know I'll make it last
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I can take it (Oh yeah)
I can fake it
I won't be playin' no more

[Chorus]
Waiting on you, I'm not going to
I won't be waiting on you no more
Waiting on you, I'm not going to
I won't be waiting on you no more
Break it down

Why do you wanna do this to me?
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Break]
Ain't gonna wait, ain't gonna wait
Waiting for you
Ain't gonna wait, ain't gonna wait
Waiting for you
Ain't gonna wait, ain't gonna wait
Waiting for you
Ain't gonna wait, ain't gonna wait
Waiting for you

[Chorus]
Waiting on you, I'm not going to
I won't be waiting on you no more
Waiting on you, I'm not going to
I won't be waiting on you no more
Waiting on you, I'm not going to
I won't be waiting on you no more
Waiting on you, I'm not going to
I won't be waiting on you no more

Waiting on you, I'm not going to
I won't be waiting on you no more
Waiting on you, I'm not going to
I won't be waiting on you no more

Waiting on you, I'm not going to
