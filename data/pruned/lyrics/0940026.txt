Very far away in a foreign land
Live the yellow woman and the yellow man
He's been around for many-a-year
They say they were there before we were here

[Bridge]
Eatin' rice all day
While the children play
You see he believes in the family
Just like you and me

[Verse 2]
Oh, yellow man, oh, yellow man
We understand, you know we understand
He keeps his money tight in his hand
With his yellow woman, he's a yellow man

[Outro]
Got to have a yellow woman
When you're a yellow manYou might also like
