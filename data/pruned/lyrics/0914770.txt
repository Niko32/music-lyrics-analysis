Me and Bill packed the car in the pourin' rain
Winch and John were at the beer stand, gettin' spraddled
But we got 'em gathered and hit the road again
Chewin' snoose and spittin' in a bottle
With country music blastin' on the radio
Talkin' girls and broncs and gold beltbuckles
Rollin' south to a California rodeo
Just rollin' down that great American highway
With the mornin' sky lit up like a flame
Chasin' dreams and followin' a rainbow
Like children runnin' through the rain
Well it's rodeo time in Oakdale, California
And we stumble with the trash out of the car
And ole Bill looks at me through whiskers and wild, red eyeballs
And says, we look more like hobo's than big-time rodeo stars
Well we ride our broncs and we all win a little money
And there's Winch over at the beer stand again
But look, he's got his arm around a little California honey
An' Bill says...I wonder if that lady there's got any friends
Just rollin' down that great American highway
With the mornin' sky lit up like a flame
Chasin' dreams and followin' a rainbow
Like children runnin' through the rain
Well, the years went by and now we've all got families
Ah, but we still get together every now and then
And we talk about all the bad broncs and good times
Lord, somtimes I wish I was back on that road again...
Just rollin' down that great American highway
With the moernin' sky lit up like a flame
Chasin' dreams and followin' a rainbow
Like children runnin' through the rain
Just chasin dreams and followin' a rainbow...
Like crazy children runnin' through the rain...You might also like
