Remember you told me how the good will fall
Well, talk is cheap but I remember it all
You kissed my cheek, yeah, I admit
It turned my head just a little bit
I see your picture now everywhere
Collins Bay down to Reading Square
You say good luck to the people you meet
You never set foot on any of their streets

[Chorus]
Well, that was the day that we rode together
Times like that are now gone forever
Well, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon down with us
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon down with us

[Verse 2]
Climbing the ladder and watching your step
Burnt-out vans up to corporate jets
You used my trust yeah that ain't tough
I hung around 'cause I'm stupid enough

[Chorus]
Well, that was the day that we rode together
Times like that are now gone forever
Well, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon down with us
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon down with us
C'mon down, down, down
Yeah

[Chorus]
That was the day that we rode together
Times like that are now gone forever
Well, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon down with us
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon down with us
C'mon down, down, down

[Verse 3]
The bigger they are, yeah, the farther they crawl
Don't be afraid you never got that tall
You make a big deal 'bout your neighborhood friends
But it's such a drag just to see you again

[Chorus]
Well, that was the day that we stoned together
Times like that are now gone forever
Well, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
C'mon down with us
C'mon down
C'mon down, down, down
