Take it!

[Verse 1]
Sometimes, I wish I was brave
I wish I was stronger, I wish I could feel no pain
I wish I was young, I wish I was shy
I wish I was honest, I wish I was you, not I

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel so mad, I feel so angry
I feel so calloused, so lost, confused, again
I feel so cheap, so used, unfaithful
Let's start over, let's start over

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I wish I was smart
I wish I made cures for how people are
I wish I had power, I wish I could lead
I wish I could change the world for you and me

[Chorus]
'Cause I feel so mad, I feel so angry
I feel so calloused, so lost, confused, again
I feel so cheap, so used, unfaithful
Let's start over, let's start over
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I feel so mad, I feel so angry
I feel so calloused, so lost, confused, again
I feel so cheap, so used, unfaithful
Let's start over, let's start over

'Cause I feel so mad, I feel so angry
I feel so calloused, so lost, confused, again
I feel so cheap, so used, unfaithful
Let's start over, let's start over

[Outro]
Let's start over
