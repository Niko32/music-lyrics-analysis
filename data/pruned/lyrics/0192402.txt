I’m taking off to the top of the charts
And I’m going up and I ain’t stoppin’ till Mars
Yeah, I’m sick and I ain’t stoppin’ till SARS
Like an alcoholic fucker I be hittin’ up bars
And I be rappin’ till I drop dead
You ain’t gonna stop me
Or top me, mad that you not me
Beat hits hard like Jeremy Shockey
Like an upside down plant, I’m a pot head
So knock me down, I fuckin' dare you
All you other whack rappers are scared to
Ya’ll gotta sign saying ‘whack’ that's nailed to you
I got one that says ‘bitch be careful’
So watch out or be cautious now
This my line and you crossed it now
I’m the boss of this house
You talkin’ shit, I’mma toss it, I wash it out
So, when I get the throne nobody can take it
Let’s face it, boy it’s hard to get famous
But I got a chance, I’mma chase it
Might as well not waste it
Got my shoes on, gotta lace it

[Hook: SkiBs]
I got this whole life figured out
And nothing nobody can do now
Cuz’ I’m takin’ off
Yeah, I’m takin’ off
I be rippin' but I'm just a child
Got sick shit comin’ outta my mouth
Yeah, I’m takin’ off
Yeah, I’m takin’ off

Now I’m on my second verse and I’m off of the ground
Chillin’ in space, passin’ the blunt around
And I’m high both ways never comin' down
Just passed the clouds becoming something now
And I could take ya’ll out with one sentence
Bustin' in the rap game show me the entrance
I forgot to say and mention
Ya’ll so damn broke you can’t even afford to pay attention
Knockin’ down fences, breakin’ down barriers
I’m everywhere like a cellphone carrier
Like “Hey homie, can you hear me bruh”
Not bro homie, ya’ll can film it up
Gimme this rap burger with extra sauce
Y'all asked for well done but I’m extra raw
And I can’t hear you breakin’ off
Tell her to take it off, cause I’m takin’ off

[Hook: SkiBs]
I got this whole life figured out
And nothing nobody can do now
Cuz’ I’m takin’ off
Yeah, I’m takin’ off
I be rippin' but I'm just a child
Got sick shit comin’ outta my mouth
Yeah, I’m takin’ off
Yeah, I’m takin’ off
