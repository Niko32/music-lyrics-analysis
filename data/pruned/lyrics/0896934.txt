You painted scheemes and lovely dreams with all your temptation
You spoke of things like wedding rings and promised her the world
For no cause at all you let her fall and now she's yesterday's girl

You think it's smart to lure the heart of a girl whose lips you kissed
Is it just a game to add her name to your broken hearted list
You've loved some long you've loved some wrong you promised each the world
Each game to be just a memory and another yesterday's girl

Don't you sometimes feel that love is real the greatest thing in life
Not one romance you gave the chance to be your cherished wife
You cheat and lie you make them cry and promise each the world
And one by one they each become another yesterday's girl

When autumn falls and you recall the things that might have been
Then you'll pause and see your cause the greed that's deep within
When you're old and love grows cold I'll bet you'd give the world
To just relive and take and give the love of a yesterday's girlYou might also like
