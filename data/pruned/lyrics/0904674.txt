I'm tired of transportation in the back of a hack
I love to hear the rhythm of the clickety clack
And hear the lonesome whistle, see the smoke from the stack
And pal around with democratic fellas named Mac
So, take me right back to the track, Jack

Choo-choo choo-choo ch-boogie
Woo-woo woo-woo ch-boogie
Choo-choo choo-choo ch-boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack

You reach your destination but alas and alack
You need some compensation to get back in the black
You take a mornin' paper from the top of the stack
And read the situation from the front to the back
The only job that's open needs a man with a knack
So, put it right back in the rack, Jack

Choo-choo choo-choo ch-boogie
Woo-woo woo-woo ch-boogie
Choo-choo choo-choo ch-boogie
Take me right back to the track, Jack

Gonna settle down by the railroad track
And live the life o'Riley in a beaten down shack
So when I hear a whistle I can peep thru the crack
And watch the train a rollin' when it's ballin-the-jack
For I just love the rhythm of the clickety clack
So take me right back to the track, Jack
