I asked you a question
But I didn't need you to reply
"Is it getting heavy?"
But then I realized

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it getting heavy?
Well, I thought it was already as heavy as can be

[Verse 2]
Is it overwhelming
To use a crane to crush a fly?
It's a good time for a Superman
To lift the sun into the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause it's getting heavy
Well I thought it was already as heavy as can be

[Chorus]
Tell everybody waiting for a Superman
That they should try to hold on best they can
He hasn't dropped them, forgot them, or anything
It's just too heavy for a Superman to lift

Cause it's getting heavy
Well I thought it was already as heavy as can be

[Chorus]
Tell everybody waiting for a Superman
That they should try to hold on best they can
He hasn't dropped them, forgot them, or anything
It's just too heavy for a Superman to lift

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause it's getting heavy
Well I thought it was
Already as heavy as can be

[Chorus]
Tell everybody waiting for a Superman
That they should try to hold on best they can
He hasn't dropped them, forgot them, or anything
It's just too heavy for a Superman to lift
