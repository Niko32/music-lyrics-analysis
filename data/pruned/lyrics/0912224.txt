I been did X and O's
I got 'em pigeon toed, I really got you skin and bone
I'm golden like my tone, light Meek with the tone
Finna blow up like my phone, finna sell like Al Capone
Bars like some Dove, my reflection who I love
Strutting like I am the shit and stomping, Third Boy's in the cut
All black but I'm living, realistic and livid
Achilles heel on the pivot, a riveting exhibition
They gonna have my ass singing
Hash-slanging, chain hanging, banter is all I'm saying
Mentality tainted they fainted, hated and fate did
Gave them lacking education, so gracious I'm blessed with patience
Persona so arcane, no playing if you're plain
Your whole crew is super lame, I can't wait to switch with fame
So all that is to blame whenever I start to fade
Disassociate from y'all brains in any kind of way

[Hook]
I don't play no games, no gifts
Barons on, home-running first pitch
I could be something so cool and so different
Ambitious but so cold and so distant

[Verse 2]
I come, I see, I conquer
Since Kool Aid and talking proper
A pauper rich with his words
Better seen than never heard
Mixed boy prevailing and sailing
Through life with self education
Picking up pieces, Paloma
Before I score a diploma
You might also likeWhile I'm still an awkward loner who's popular with the stoners
Rose like Amber on opponents
One I'm on it, I'm upon it
Exotic flow, you can't stop it
Bet bottom dollars I top it, you can't mess with Jimmy Hawkins
I'm such a gentleman when I'm balling like Spalding
You would never know I'm shitting on you by how I'm walking
How come it's always for an audience when they acting crass?
They ain't going to be saying nothing when I'm up in that ass
