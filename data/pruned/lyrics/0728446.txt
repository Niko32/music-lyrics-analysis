Oh, Death
Won't you spare me over till another year?

What is this that I can't see?
With ice-cold hands takin' hold of me
Well, I am Death, none can excel
I open the door to heaven or hell

Oh, Death
Oh, Death
Won't you spare me over till another year?

I'll rattle your tongue till you can't talk
I'll step on your limbs till you can walk
I'll blind you eyes till you can't see
This very hour, come go with me

Oh, Death
Oh, Death
Won't you spare me over till another year?

Oh Death, how you're treating me
You're blinding my eyes till I can't see
You stiffen my limbs, making me cold
Run my body right out of my soul
You might also likeOh, Death
Whoa, Death
Won't you spare me over till another year?
Won't you spare me over till another year?
Won't you spare me over till another year?

[Additional verses, not included in this recording:]
I'll fix your feet till you can't walk
I'll lock your jaw till you can't talk
I'll close your eyes so you can't see
This very hour, come and go with me

This is Death, I come to take the soul
Leave the body and leave it cold
To drop the flesh off of the frame
The earth and worms both have a claim

My mother came to my bed
Placed a cold towel upon my head
My head is warm, my feet are cold
Death is a-moving upon my soul

Oh Death, how you're treatin' me
You closed my eyes so I can't see
Well, you're hurtin' my body, you make me cold
You run my life right out of my soul
Oh Death, please consider my age
Please don't take me at this stage
My wealth is all at your command
If you will move your icy hand

Oh the young, the rich or poor
All alike me, you know
No wealth, no land, no silver, no gold
Nothin' satisfies me but your soul

Oh, Death
Whoa, Death
Won't you spare me over till another year?
Won't you spare me over till another year?
Won't you spare me over till another year?
