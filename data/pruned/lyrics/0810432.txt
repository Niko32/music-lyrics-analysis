Orpheus melted the heart of Persephone
But I never had yours
I followed you back to the end of the path
But I never found the door

[Pre Chorus]
And you can work to save your love
You can bear it from the earth below
You can work, but you can't let go
Oh, oh but you have to know

[Chorus]
Don't look back all you'll ever get
Is the dust from the steps before
I don't have to see you every day
But I just want to know you're there

[Verse 2]
Quietly took to the dark of the day
And the hiss of the summer night
The heat of the breeze was a cell block wall
And when I looked you were out of sight

[Pre Chorus]
And you can work to save your love
You can bear it from the earth below
You can work, but you can't let go
Oh, oh but you have to know
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't look back all you'll ever get
Is the dust from the steps before
I don't have to see you every day
But I just want to know you're there

[Pre Chorus]
And you can work to save your love
You can bear it from the earth below
You can work but you can't let go
Oh, oh but you have to know

[Chorus]
Don't look back all you'll ever get
Is the dust from the steps before
I don't have to see you every day
But I just want to know you're there

Don't look back all you'll ever get
Is the dust from the steps before
I don't have to see you every day
But I just want to know you're there

Don't look back all you'll ever get
Is the dust from the steps before
I don't have to see you every day
But I just want to know you're there
[Outro]
Don't look back all you'll ever get
Is the dust from the steps before
