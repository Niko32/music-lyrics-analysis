I'm sitting next to you on this plane
You're as high as this jet is
You tell me pop a few for my pain
But my ears' already poppin'
You told me meet you in the bathroom
And you love me while the water runnin'
But I ain't interested in that
I'm just trying to get to where I'm going
Not down for playing game
So would you mind if we just stay flowing?
And please don't say my name
I don't want anybody around us, knowing

[Outro: Sonadroy Eleya]
Knowing (x3)
I don't want anybody around us, knowing
Knowing (x4)
