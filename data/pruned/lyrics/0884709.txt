Her eyes looked cool
The wind cries true
Now my time has come

Sweet days of dream
All that I need
Let your hair grow long on planet love

[Chorus]
I hear your tambourines
Inside my head, she says
I hang my star on you

[Verse 2]
All too much
Takes my breath
Now my time has come

Love love love
All's so serene
Clouds like plasticine on planet love

[Chorus]
I hear your tambourines
Inside my head, she says
I hang my star on you
You might also like[Bridge]
Love love love
All that I need
Clouds like plasticine on planet love

[Outro]
I hear your tambourines
Inside my head, she says
I hear your tambourines
On planet love, she says
On planet love, on planet love
On planet love, on planet love
On planet love, on planet love
On planet love...
