Hey, woo-hoo, ooh!

[Verse 1: Stan Walker]
Not sure how I survived before I left this night
Before I came alive, I was lost
I felt you pulling me, harder than gravity
Harder than anything I know

[Pre-Chorus: Jessica Mauboy]
So in love with you, there's nothing I won't do
I'll travel at the speed of light so I can be right by your side
You make me feel like the whole world isn't real
And I'm the only star in the sky, sky, sky, sky

[Chorus: Both, Jessica Mauboy alone]
Eh, there's no time or space
Everything just melts away
When I'm lying here
In your galaxy
With you is my eternity
No place I'd rather be
When I'm lying here (When I'm lying here)
In your galaxy

[Post-Chorus: Both, Jessica Mauboy alone]
Oh, oh, whoa (Oh whoa)
Oh, oh, whoa (Oh whoa)
Oh, oh, whoa
In your galaxy
With you is my eternity
No place I'd rather be
When I'm lying here
In your galaxy
You might also like[Interlude: Jessica Mauboy]
Whoa whoa whoa whoa, yeah

[Verse 2: Jessica Mauboy, Stan Walker]
Like a comet to my heart, you illuminate the dark
Show me all the parts of me I've never seen
We come from different places, different constellations
When I'm with you I'm home, I'm home

[Pre-Chorus: Jessica Mauboy]
You make it feel like the whole world isn't real
And I'm the only star in the sky

[Chorus: Both, Jessica Mauboy, Stan Walker]
Yeah, there's no time or space (No time or space)
Everything just melts away (Melts away)
When I'm lying here
In your galaxy
With you is my eternity (My eternity)
No place I'd rather be (No place)
When I'm lying here (I'm lying here, yeah!)
In your galaxy

[Post-Chorus: Both, Jessica Mauboy alone]
Oh, oh, whoa (Oh whoa)
Oh, oh, whoa (Oh whoa)
Oh, oh, whoa
In your galaxy
With you is my eternity
No place I'd rather be
When I'm lying here
In your galaxy
[Bridge: Jessica Mauboy, Stan Walker, Both]
You healed every heartbreak, took me on a journey
To a place so high, way above the clouds
Don't matter where we go, as long as I'm in your world
I never wanna be any place, yeah!

[Chorus: Both, Jessica Mauboy, Stan Walker]
Eh, there's no time or space
Everything just melts away
When I'm lying here (When I'm lying here, yeah, yeah)
In your galaxy (Yeah yeah!)
With you is my eternity (It's my eternity)
No place I'd rather be
When I'm lying here (When I'm lying here)
In your galaxy (Oh, oh)

[Post-Chorus: Both, Jessica Mauboy, Stan Walker]
Oh, oh, whoa (Oh whoa)
Oh, oh, whoa (Oh whoa)
Oh, oh, whoa (Yeah)
In your galaxy (Yeah!)
With you is my eternity
No place I'd rather be
When I'm lying here (When I'm lying here)
In your galaxy
