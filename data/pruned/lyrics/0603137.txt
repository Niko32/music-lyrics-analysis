Shes like an angel and super model combined
Shes one of them girls thats impossible to find
And I thought to myself get too close and you'll end up getting declined
Seein her made my heart beat too fast, her body was undefined
And her face just shined, I swear I wanted her to be mine
The thought of her sent shivers down my spine
Doing something to harm her would be the worst crime

And I can't even start to describe how she made feel
The way I got the butterflies all the time was just unreal
The thought of her being mine was so ****ing ideal
She span my mind around like a water wheel
When I daze at her walking from a distance my jaw always dropped
And when i knew she acknowledged my existance my heart always stopped
She was so perfect, no disrespect, she always had me instantly erect
I couldn't never even find a defect. or maybe I should get my eyes rechecked
Incorrect, she looks better than those fakes with special effects

Babe, honestly, you everything I ever wished for
Theres nothing about you that I dont adore
Please take my hand, and above everyone we'll soar
I swear I'll take you to a place you've never explored before
I look into your eyes, straight away you have me hypnotized
After seeing her, I didn't even need a zoot, she had me more ****ed than those illegal highs
Being in her presense was like my greatest prize
I just wish I could get more closer
But I'm scared shes something that I won't get over
You might also likeMy aim is to find the key to her heart
Be able to unlock it and then give it a kick start
But I need to realize its gonna be way too hard
Theres a big chance of me getting terribly scarred
Im never gonna find a girl like her though
Why can't I force myselft to let go ?
Maybe I haven't had enough of the love that she shows
For the things that she made me realize, my life i owe
And so, I want her to know, that she makes my tears glow
When im trying find my way
Through the dark tunnel, where theres no light and no place to go
So I thank her deeply for the gift that she bestowed

Enough of this **** having to be so complicated
And too much have I contemplated
Getting sedated, doin my ting, months went by as I patiently waited
Till she slowly stopped keeping me updated
And it was unrated, the way that she vacated
The horror of a broken heart that she recreated
There was no way to have my feelings expressed
I was way more than just depressed
I was distressed, dissapointed, and possibly possessed
My heart wanted to go ona protest
After that I understood lifes just a test
And theres no rest, until you've fully completed your quest
**** will start hitting you from north, east, south, west
And theres a limit on the amount of life vests
If your not carefull your mind and body will end up dispossesed
Now you dont wanna be put to an eternal rest?
