Forged of steel, the cage shows the pain
Reflecting on his fate
The red walls are nothing more than ways
Gates of Hell unleashed
Bones and dust create the morbid visions
Releasing souls to the underworld
Just a step for the scorching to begin

Violent incineration
Scorching flesh, knives of blaze

Flags in fire on the way
Makes the sacrifice freeze in fear
Soldiers shows their face
Scars are buried deep in flesh
Silence stood in air
Is a sign that death is near the walls
Spears motionless
Mark the place where the victims suffer more

Violent incineration
Resisting souls, willing to live

Memories of Dead
From living souls, they try to live
Visions from the Abyss
Dark and Terror, it's all that is left
Killing seasons to come
Force the fated to fight the way out
Red horizons in sight
Smoke forms the shadow of death
