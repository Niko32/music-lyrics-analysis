Coz someone knew
And you're wrong
Coz I crawled in to
And you're right
Coz someone near you is sad
And I can't stop feeling bad
And I forgot what she said
Should I care?

I did it once, I might do it again
I did it twice, I might do it again

It's a style and the way I live
That's where we are in time
So fucking get in line
And roll it up
For someone near you is blank
And I can't get out of bed
Should I care?

I did it wrong
I might do it again
I did it right
I could do it again
