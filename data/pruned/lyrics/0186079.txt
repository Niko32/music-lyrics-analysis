Oh, my love
If I had my way
Then all your dreams
Would come true
Oh, my love
All your dreams
And all the world
Just for you
Oh, my love
If I had my way
Just for you

[Bridge]
Spread yourself across my lips
And I'll spoon you in
The sweetest thing in all the world
Oh, I want more
There is no place I'd rather be
Than here with you
Under the sun or pouring rain
All of the sky for you

[Verse 2]
My love
If I had my way
Just for you
Oh, my love
Make your belly full
And all your dreams
To come trueYou might also like
