Tie me to a cinder block and throw me to the sea
Music's got more roll than rock cause everyone's poppin' E
Everybody's hypnotized, nobody is free
The river that we're drinking from is singularity

[Pre-Chorus]
Chuck your laptops
Chuck your lights
Chuck your cash crop
Chuck your tights
Chuck your glitter
You glittery shites
Chuck your laptops
Chuck your lights

[Verse 2]
Rock stars pushing buttons, few actually play
City bullet ever built don't like his special K
"Mirror, mirror, on the wall"
Where is the coolest thing?
Build a wall-less prison [?]

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
Fake future the future's fake
Computer simulate
Fake future the future's fake
Computer simulate
Fake future the future's fake
You might also like[Verse 3]
What good is my microphone if I don't really sing?
What good is my music if it ain't really me?
Whose heart's beating? I'm on life support
Creativity is gone, music is a sport

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus] - x2
Fake future the future's fake
Computer simulate
Fake future the future's fake
Computer simulate
Fake future the future's fake
Computer simulate
Fake future the future's fake
Computer simulate
Fake future the future's fake
