You can drive a car, be a movie star
Any day of the week
You don't have to shout or walk about
You just have to speak
Say, baby, you just have to speak

[Verse 2]
You can fly a plane, maybe go insane
Any day that you like
Everyone'll say, "Have you been away?"
Everything is alright
Say, baby, everything is alright

[Chorus]
Here he come
That's a winner
Here he come
Take a look, write a book
You can eat him up for dinner, yeah

[Verse 3]
You can run around over stony ground
Or lay in the sand
We don't have to show what you really know
We all understand
Say, baby, we all understand

[Verse 1]
You can drive a car, be a movie star
Any day of the week
You don't have to shout or walk about
You just have to speak
Say, baby, you just have to speak

[Chorus]
Here he come
That's a winner
Here he come
Take a look, write a book
You can eat him up for dinner, yeah

Say, baby, we all understand
Baby, we all understand
