[Verse 1]
Why must I? Nothing means anything now
I can't believe in somethin' unreal
Don't interfere with my mind, try to be kind

[Chorus]
It's down to how much
You fake in the end
You're meant to trust
To find a true friend

[Verse 2]
Don't plead with me, I'm not bound to bleed for you
I can't insist that you understand
I've tried so hard, you don't know, try to be kind

[Chorus]
It's down to how much
You fake in the end
You're meant to trust
To find a true friend

[Chorus]

To find a true friend

[Verse 4]
Don't plead with me
I'm not bound to bleed for you
I can't insist that you understand
I've tried so hard, you don't know

[Outro]
No, no, you don't know
