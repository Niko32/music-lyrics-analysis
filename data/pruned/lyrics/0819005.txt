I am night
I am vengeance
I bring light
I'm a winter breeze in summertime
The world is broken, I'm just fine
Looking day and living night
But I'm alright

I'm a winter breeze in summertime
The world is broken, I'm just fine
Looking day and living night
But I'm alright

Cloak and dagger
Cape and mask
Smoke and mirrors
Guilty past

I'm a winter breeze in summertime
The world is broken, I'm just fine
Looking day and living night
But I'm alright

I'm a winter breeze in summertime
The world is broken, I'm just fine
Looking day and living night
But I'm alright
