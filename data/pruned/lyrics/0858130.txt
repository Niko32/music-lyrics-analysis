But, here I am again, here I am again

I said I'd never let you, let me down again
But, here I am again, here I am

Here I am, here we are
And the story's getting old
I know I can't hang on to you
But worse than that I can't let go

I'm saying words I swore I'd never speak again
Like here I am again, here I am again

I thought I could stay strong
But I got weak again
And here I am again, here I am

Here I am, here we are
And the story's getting old
I know I can't hang on to you
But worse than that I can't let go

And though the nights are cold
And I could use a friend
So here I am again, here I am...againYou might also like
