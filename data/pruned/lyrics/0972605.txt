Dear John oh how I hate to write
Dear John I must let you know tonight
That my love for you has died away like grass upon the lawn
And tonight I wed another dear John

[Verse 2: Bobby Bare]
I was overseas in battle when the postman came to me
He handed me a letter and I was just as happy as I could be
'Cause the fighting was all over and the battles have all been won
But then I opened up the letter and that started dear John

[Verse 3: Bobby Bare]
Won't you please send back my picture my husband wants it now
When I tell you who I'm wedding you won't care dear anyhow
And it hurts me so to tell you that my love for you has gone
But tonight I wed your brother dear John

[Outro: Skeeter Davis]
And tonight I wed another dear JohnYou might also like
