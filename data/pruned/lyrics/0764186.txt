Secrets
Secrets

[Chorus]
Secrets, oh, what you kept from me
They make our world go around
But secrets, they only last long
Enough to break you down

[Verse 1]
Stuck sitting, you left me there waiting for you
You didn't want to be my girl
I saw you by candlelight waiting for two
Sure wasn't me who was doing it with you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but there's too much in my mind right now
To say how I feel, to do what I need to do
And how can you leave like this
When a simple kiss is all you gave me

[Chorus]
Secrets, oh, what you kept from me
They make our world go around
But secrets, they only last long
Enough to break you down
(You're keeping secrets from me)
You might also like[Verse 2]
Loving you seems foolish when you do what you do
I cannot stand the feeling without you
And I swear, girl, I'm leaving, baby, five after two
'Cause is no way I'm waiting longer for you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but there's too much in my mind right now
To say how I feel, to do what I need to do
And how can I look up to the sky
And see our love fading, baby, tell me why, oh

[Chorus]
Secrets, oh, what you kept from me
They make our world go around
But secrets, they only last long
Enough to break you down

[Bridge]
We're keeping, we're keeping secrets
Oh, oh, oh (Secrets, secrets)
Mmm, mmm, mmm, oh yeah, yeah (Oh, oh yeah)

[Chorus]
Secrets, oh, what you kept from me
They make our world go around
But secrets, they only last long
Enough to break you down
(Enough to break you down)
Secrets, oh, what you kept from me
They make our world go around
(Oh, you're keeping secrets; oh, you're keeping secrets)
But secrets, they only last long
Enough to break you down
(Oh, you're keeping secrets; oh, you're keeping secrets)
[Outro]
Secrets (Oh, oh, oh)
Secrets, they only last long
Enough to break you down
