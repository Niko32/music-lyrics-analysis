If Liberty was a little girl
Watching all the flags unfurl
Standing at the big parade
How would she like us now?

[Pre-Chorus]
We balance the power from hour to hour
Giant guns raised

[Chorus]
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home

[Verse 2]
From Vietnam to old Beirut
If we are searching for the truth
Why do we feel that double-edged blade
Cutting through our hand?

[Pre-Chorus]
America, America
Where have we gone?

[Chorus]
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home

[Pre-Chorus]
We balance the power from hour to hour
Giant guns raised

[Chorus]
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home
It's such a long walk home
