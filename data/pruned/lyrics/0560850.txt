Boy this what you doing to me
Don't even know you're doing too
Even though
Listen

[Verse 1: Paigey Cakey]
You got me waking up at four in the morning
I don't even know what you be doing to me
I can't even speak when you put me to it
You don't need to try cause we're gonna do it
We arguing late at night
I be on your phone even late at night
You'll be playing with my emotions inside
And I'll be hating ways that you got me feeling I

[Pre-Hook: Paigey Cakey]
You
The way you got me feeling, I adore you baby
You're my nigga but I wanna stay
But these other bitches gotta go

[Hook: Paigey Cakey]
Cause you wanna stay around, stay around
Why you wanna play dough?
Cause you wanna stay around, stay around
Why you wanna play dough?

I hate sharing you to myself
I hate giving you all my help
I hate telling you you're the one
I hate telling you that
You will be my husband
And have my kids one day
While you're cheating on me
I don't deserve it

[Pre-Hook] + [Hook]

[Verse 3: Yungen]
Call me Mr. Wake You When You're Half Asleep
I can't stay long, you know parking's peak
Good girl but you a tart for me
I made your cherry pop from I started deep
I give you something to remember
That good D in December
Your ex still holla but that nigga a pretender
He shoot blanks like Bendtner
What? You say I only holla when I'm bored
And I never tell you that it's yours
The word is you're talking to some new niggas
You're just the same as all them other whores
Keep thinking them Instagram niggas can give a bitch love
You not flashy like them other Instagram bitches
Girl you need to fix up
What? You saying all I ever do is play dough
You wanna settle down and just lay low
But the truth is I ain't into all that
But I ain't playing games, no
I'm just tryna have fun
I ain't lookin' for the one
I ain't lookin' for the one
[Bridge: Paige Cakey]
I put all my love in you
But you fuck around it ain't nothin' new
Why you fuck when my heart say you love me but you don't
Why?
Why you wanna play dough?
Why you wanna play dough?
Why you play?

[Outro: Paige Cakey]
Why you wanna play dough?
Locked up in a play dough
Why you wanna play with my feelings like you come around and broke my heart in two
Why you want to play?
