You're the only one and only
My heart's beating for
I love you, need I say more
Now and ever, we'll be together
Of that you can be sure
I love you, need I say more

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know just what it is
That you're needing to hear me say
The way that I'm feeling
Is more than mere words can describe
And all this discussion could never
Do justice to something so heavenly-made
I'd rather tell you
With touches how I feel inside

[Chorus]
Let me hold you, let me show you
What true love's all about
In these arms of mine I know you will find
You won't do without anymore
I'll love you forever, need I say more

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know just what it is
That you're needing to hear me say
The way that I'm feeling
Is more than mere words can describe
And all this discussion could never
Do justice to something so heavenly-made
I'd rather tell you
With touches how I feel inside
You might also like[Chorus]

[Outro]
I'll love you forever, need I say more
