Drive
Through the night
Far
As it goes
Away from the daylight
Into the afterglow

[Hook I]
Somewhere unforgiven
Time will wait for you

[Verse II]
Down
On the street
Just let the engine run
Till there's nothing left
Except the damage done

[Hook II]
Somewhere unforgiven
I will wait for you

[Hook I]
Somewhere unforgiven
Time will wait for you

Somewhere unforgiven
I will wait for you
