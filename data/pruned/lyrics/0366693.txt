You want prosperity for yourself, but not for me
Somehow you just can't see we're in this collectively
You think that freedom is a drastic severance
From your past relations, just a quest for new bargains

[Chorus]
We're not the same person
We're not the same person
Don't even wanna know
Wooohhh

[Verse 2]
Don't need no good advice, nor shoddy merchandise
I'm the suspect device, beaten down, unable to strike

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
And the sun comes over us again
We lament, we pine, and we rescind
And we ask for understanding
But aren't we the stingy ones, indeed
When it's asked of us in the end?

[Verse 3]
We watch the days go by, compete and then we die
So few ever ask why, but so many just abuse the design
