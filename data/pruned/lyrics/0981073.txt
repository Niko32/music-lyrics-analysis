And I almost drowned
Sometimes the happiness just all fades away
And it can't be found, no

But I won't give up, no I won't give in
Cause after the night, a new day will begin

Oh the sun will come up gonna shine again
See the clouds roll away and the rain end
I know after it all I will live again
It's only a matter of time
Till I'm back on my feet and I'm standing tall
No it won't keep me down, I will not fall
I know You're by my side, You help me through it all
You're with me all the way

The waters rise above my head
It's a churning flood
Make me feel like givin' in
Or even wish that I was dead
But then You pull me out

And You lift me up to a higher place
To a refuge of hope, sheltered in Your embrace
You might also likeWhen storms arrive and vile tempests blow
There's only one safe harbor that I know
You calm the storm, You calm the raging sea
And You will never turn Your love from me
