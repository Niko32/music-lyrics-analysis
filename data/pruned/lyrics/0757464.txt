I've been hard up, tore down, the things I've been through
And the angels won't take me away
And I've talked to Saint Peter, he won't let me pass
So it looks like I'm goin' today

[Chorus 1]
So let's have a party and tell 'em I'm home
There'll be Waylon and Whitley as well
And the devil will be dealing, the cards as they lay
So let's have a party in hell

[Verse 2]
Washed up, worn out, and down on my knees
But the angels won't take me away
The bartender only serves brown liquor in hell
And that sure sounds like heaven to me

[Chorus 2]
So let's have a party and tell 'em I'm home
There'll be Janice and Jimi as well
And Rick James will bring all the cocaine you want
So let's have a party in hell

[Chorus 3]
So let's have a party and tell 'em we're home
They'll be No Show and Junior and Merle
And Jamie Johnson'll be drinking from a brown paper bag
So let's have a party in hellYou might also like
