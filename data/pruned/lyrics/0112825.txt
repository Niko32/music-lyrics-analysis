We the business, Niggas you tha witness
All thos bitches asking for forgiveness

Getting money but ain't get no curse
C8!Yeah!That's my nickname
Them bitches like to say when they pay with the big rates
New Bugatti in the city,we race
(Ahi) Scared face kilos,cocaine kill'em, running running in tha shit nervs
I run my hood like a Tema King, and I can ball well like Yao Ming
That's just the beginning
Fresh C to the air spring
Angels are coming you've heard (ping)
All is going wrong
Devil do anything
This is rap that's not simple singin

[Verse 2: BBlack]

We all got different religion
C8 or B Black? discord and collisions
Do you believe in gods? you only need Volition
Find it and complete ya' fucking mission, well
(C8 MY NIGGA)
Umm sorry for C8s intervention
Two gods in competition
Two different predictions
Two simple words: B Black
Yah.. thats my description
CBGODS in black edition
White bitches in CBs songs
Love my godsons (Humans)
Ambition!
You're asking me too for forgiveness
Can I bless you all for your non-altruism?
CGOD and BGOD created egyptians!
Now listen
I'm your pharaho that's the Cult of the dead
We given advice about how to live
Brought the bread, your minds are little little
Yeah , you're not my fuckin' leader
Even if I'm wanted like Tutankhamun
Forgone at your future, come on
I'm not a killer
All this humans want the können
(i wanna have können)
Run and tell your city that I'm on
I got the können
As-Salamu Alaykum
Wa alaikum as salaam
Now you're asking who wrote the Koran
Speaking K, go to hell KK Klan
Take ma AK, mo more fun
CBOGS We the Gods
I'm gone
No more pity for no one
CGODs my gun
AJs my sun
Sams my little son
Uh.. CBGODS is our song
Rapping alone all along
I belong at you
You support me
Cause you know I got sense of right and wrong

Life is a game
Life is just a game
C8 is my name
Life is just game

[Verse 3: C8]

I close my eyes and see that nigga gone(damn)
Just a short journey and you gone, Life ain't too long
You closed ya eyes and light was off
Maybe I was wrong
I touch my heart and feel tha pain boy
(You went too fast, you went too fast)
Dear Lord why so early and not later on
We ain't got no mission,no more television
Black days on,fuck immagination
Mama ask me why,daddy say no cry
Clean my eyes full of tears, feel like wanna die
Roaming in C road with tha blue paint on my neck
Respecting my nigga TT,diamonds everywhere
God gave me check and I paid it back
And pray... can TT come more back?
Respect
Now I pass that fucking Hot baller to my nigga BBlack
[Verse 4: BBlack]

Thinking back
I've already lost my knack
Bag of money in the back
Fuck you pass me the cigarette
I ain't smoke I cut it, zack
Less smoke more life
You're shooting yourself with the mac
Double pacK rappin' and slam dunkin' fell like Shaq
I'm waiting a martian's attack
I'm gettin your fuckin respect
On the corner of the street with a black dagg
Attentively watchin you and my blood now is Jack's
Be and forever wanna be black
OMA BGOD
And CGOD my nigga C8
Today
Life is a Game
