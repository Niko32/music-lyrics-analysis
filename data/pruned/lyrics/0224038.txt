There's no gravity up here
It's kind of hard to explain
Every time I'm holding you
It's like backwards rain, yeah

[Chorus]
You lift me up
Like a kite on a string, like a bird on new found wings
So high on you, I'm floating and flying around
Your love is like fallin' upside down

[Verse 2]
You've got me so lightheaded (You've got me so lightheaded)
It's a dizzy mood (It's a dizzy mood)
Spinning uncontrollably, and gaining altitude

[Chorus]
You lift me up
Like a kite on a string, like a bird on new found wings
So high on you, I'm floating and flying around
Your love is like fallin' upside down

[Bridge]
Look at me, used to be
I could keep my feet on the ground
When you said you could take me higher
You weren't playing around (You weren't playing around)
You might also like[Chorus]
You lift me up
Like a kite on a string, like a bird on new found wings
So high on you, I'm floating and flying around
(I'm floating and flying around)
Your love is like fallin' upside down
