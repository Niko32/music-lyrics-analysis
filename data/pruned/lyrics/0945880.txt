And i find myself
Feels so warm
Just to know you're near
And the way that you glow
Makes me feel so safe
It's like you take me with your words
It's more than i could dream

I feel i'm into deep
I'm feeling i'm drowning
It feels to perfect
Never want to surface
And i don't want to fall
From where we are now
I don't want to fall
Never coming down
Oh spill a tear

Lately i look into you
And see just who i am
It's like the christmas of dreams
All the luscious things
I caught a vision of you
Carried on angels wings
Across the starfilled sky
Made everything seem right
And i talked of love
Things we wish could be
Just promise that you'll wait
Promise that you'll wait for me
You might also likeI don't want to fall
From where we are now
I dont want to fall
Never coming down
Oh spill a tear
Oh spill a tear
Oh spill a tear, spill a tear, spill a tear, spill a tear...
