I say this ones for Pam
Hope you good type of shit u shouldn't read for the fam
Haven't seen you for years
Look you should see who I am
You should check out my pics
Ow yeah you got instagram?
You leave no space on the ceiling, big fan
They want beef, bunch of cowards
But I'm cool Pam
Hope you miss me coz I heard you ain't a good shooter
Shit I lost my momma and i miss her more than you Pam
Our relationship is sinking
Now I'm hardly thinking
If I should let it go
For sure you know I've been hardly sippin'
Wish we meet up
What if the lions jump up
Throwin' dollar signs up
But still I never fuck up ayy...
No nigga role model
Niggas still hatin' on me coz I'm rollin with models
We had cash on our way up
Wait, how we broke up
But life goes on and bye i gotta roll up Kader
[Hook: Kader]
I say this ones for Pam
I say this ones for Pam
When I'm gonna see you again
Right now I wanna cry in the rain ooohh
I say this ones for Pam
I say this ones for Pam
You the reason why I sip everyday
Rollin' up I'm blowing trees everyday
Yeah for real I ain't playin'
[Verse 2:]
You neva told me that you going far
Heart freezing, body avatar
If it's over well let's reach it up
I'm feelin like a present on the ceiling
Coz I'm rapping up
I wanna get my digits up like a scoreboard
I'm lionhearted why the fuck you think my beats raw
I do it better than the old yeah i knew that
Going HAM my whole life yeah but screw that
Did you make up your mind
Like you always did to your face everytime
We had cash on our way up
Wait, how we broke up
But life goes on and bye i gotta roll up Kader
