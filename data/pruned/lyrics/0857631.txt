If you're not real
Let me keep feelin'
The way I feel
I'm bubblin' over
With joy supreme
And if I'm dreamin'
A-just let me dream

A-please don't wake me
If I'm asleep
Just give the angels
My soul to keep
I'll feel so happy
If I could speak
And if I'm dreamin'
Just let me dream

My heart is jumpin'
Up and down the street
If-a this ain't love
It's the next best thing

So keep on doin'
What your doin' to me
If I'm your prisoner
Don't set me free
Your red hot kisses
Warm me like steam
And so if I'm dreamin'
Just let me dream
You might also likeSo keep on doin'
What your doin' to me
If I'm your prisoner
Don't set me free
Your red hot kisses
Warm me like steam
So if I'm dreamin'
A-just let me dream
Just let me dream
