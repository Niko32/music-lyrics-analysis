Fuck a lapdance, motherfuck a lapdance
Fuck a lapdance, motherfuck all that
Fuck a lapdance, motherfuck a lapdance
You think I'mma spend this dough I hustled up on that?
Climb off that pole then climb on my pole then
I'mma make it rain, I'm talkin' about your love below and
Climb off that pole then climb on my pole and
My point I'mma make plain as if I work for Boeing
You're grindin' on the wrong pole, you're grindin' on the wrong pole
Bad strippers in this club that I'm tryin' to take to the [mo' ??]
Cuz they grindin' on the wrong pole, grindin' on the wrong pole
Still one's gon' get this long dick from behind, inside the chokehold

[Verse 1: Kenny]
She must have gigs like an actress if she think that I'm finna be hard
She can live in my memory if she got gigs like a memory card
I'm tryin' to relax from a day of stress
And watch you throw it back like we playin' catch
And watch you break it down like a weed nug
Slow it down then speed up
Rest of the niggas here ain't no threat
Watch who she come to when she ain't on set
We gon' hit the tail like anal sex
I can make her feel like rain, so wet
Oh yes, gon' get all wet, not talkin' bout a drink
If we not talkin' bout my dick, then we not talkin' bout a thing

They call em strippers cuz they strippin' with no tees
And they switched it with the letter C cuz they just let us see
Them edible set of lips and incredible set of tits
Instead of an F'in tip, I'd rather give a better tip
I mean the tip of this dick, tell em I'd rather hit
Then I be takin' em home, then I'm makin' em moan
Then I give her the long dong, schlong, and I ain't payin' em shit
(Wait a minute wait) I be hittin' them little ladies with real game
You be callin' strippers Mercedes, I know they real name
I be gettin' strippers to pay me like I'm pimpin' em crazy
Pimpin' em crazy is my middle name
After she strip for me, she wanna lick on the big homie
Then she wanna kiss on the big homie
If only these strippers knew what we finna do
By the way, I call this dick on me Big Homie

[Hook: Kenny]

[Verse 3: Julius Luciano]
I got a lapdance from a chick from the Phillipines
Feelin' on my jeans now she finna feel the penis
I'm a fly motherfucker, every bitch in this club wanna be my babymother on some Billie Jean shit
I'm tryin' to get me a menage, tryin' to pull my long whip in your garage, I got a limousine dick
I come between your left eye and your right thigh, you can say my dick is intervenin'
Like an intravenous tube, this shit is in my veins
I mean pimpin', I'm not into makin' it rain
I'm interested in enterin' you while you entertain
You dumb fly, simple and plain
Ey wait, you want cheese yo, hold on
I ain't cheap but listen my team don't throw no dough on hoes
Even if I'm gettin' dome yo, better believe it's gonna be pro bono
[Hook: Kenny]
