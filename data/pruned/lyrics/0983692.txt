Yes they tell me they make quite a pair
And that they both look happy together
I just wonder, not that I care

Tell me did she look lovely as ever
Like an angel with golden hair
Does she still close her eyes when she dances
I just wonder, not that I care

Once I thought I couldn't live without her
Funny how wrong I could be
Now I hardly ever think about her
What she does, doesn't mean a thing to me

Well, it's late so I guess I'll be going
Too much smoke, what I need is some air
By the way did she ask you about me
I just wonder, not that I care
