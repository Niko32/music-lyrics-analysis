Begging at your feet
Got me at me weakest
I’m looking in your eyes
Deep into your soul

Kick me to the street
History repeats
Cause i just can’t handle
The way you pull me in
Keeps me on my toes

Treat me mean it's keeping me keen

Tasting your love on the tip of my tongue
Chasing this rush
Your not holding me down
So get up get up
Save a little sin for me
Oh you're my chemical blonde

Chemi-chemi-chemical blonde

Facing all me demons
Tried to fight that feeling
But i know its coming
I’m meeting more of you
Scared to know you're gone
You might also likeTreat me mean it's keeping me keen
Treat me mean it's keeping me keen

Tasting your love on the tip of my tongue
Chasing this rush
Your not holding me down
So get up get up
Save a little sin for me
Oh you're my chemical blonde

Chemi-chemi-chemical blonde

Treat me mean it's keeping me keen
Treat me mean it's keeping me keen

Tasting your love on the tip of my tongue
Chasing this rush
Your not holding me down
So get up get up
Save a little sin for me
Oh you're my chemical blonde

Chemi-chemi-chemical blonde

Tasting your love on the tip of my tongue
Chasing this rush
Your not holding me down
So get up get up
Save a little sin for me
Oh you're my chemical blonde
Chemi-chemi-chemical blonde
