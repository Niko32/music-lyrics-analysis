Knowing
Is what people tell you
That you're thinking wrong
Embrace you
But they really mean "So long"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You talk to them
They laugh aloud
Yet they run to you
In any crowd

[Chorus]
Please talk to me again
I need you

[Verse 2]
We're dancing
We will come and dance near you
We want to learn
Let us come and sitar with you

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Distort my ears when
The music's loud
Yet you raise your hatchet
In the yellow crowd
You might also like[Chorus]
Please talk to me again
I need you

[Verse 1]
Knowing
Is what people tell you
That you're thinking wrong
Embrace you
But they really mean "So long"

[Pre-Chorus 1]
You talk to them
They laugh aloud
Yet they run to you
In any crowd

[Chorus]
Please talk to me again
I need you
