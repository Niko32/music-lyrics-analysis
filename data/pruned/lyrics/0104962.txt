Just, just think

[Verse One]:
54-11 size 7 in hers
24/7 guys stressin' her curves
Like, "Give me your digits, I'll balance your world"
Like axis, cats just ignorant, plural
Niggas don't get it, might get on her nerves
Them po' chickens go trickin' like a business with perks
They goal tendin' no winners, slow sippin' on purp
With no purpose, they dig they own spirits in dirt
They so worthless, feelin' like a nigga berzerk
If he don't purchase, dinner, wine and give her dessert
His whole service depends on how you givin' up skirt
If he knows you worth it the limo might just lift you to work
These niggas
Lou Rawls, perverted pimpin' at church
A jerk will give him a smirk
She rippin' dudes off
She give him blue balls, Smurfette and a Smurf nigga
Forgettin' her worth bigger than Benjamin
She needs a gentleman

[Chorus]:
Just think
Just think
What if she could just
Just blink herself away
Just think
Just think
What if she could just
Just blink herself away
Leave this world already
Forgetting Hell while inhaling faded ?
Tryin' to sink herself in rain

Fetus swelled her belly
For gettin' nailed in the telly
Baby daddy couldn't sneak from jail today
He was well and paid
From flippin' crills but now his bail
Would take a family of Caesar's wealth to pay
Jesus, help her pain
She in the church more than grandma
Searchin' for the answer
Then ???
After workin' Pampers not searchin' for no hand outs
She just want a man she can trust, not a trust fund
A man who understands she don't lust cause the bucks come
And she won't go when the bills high and doe's low
Long as she know that he's real right she holds on
Long as that hold ain't a choke hold
She feel like ?
It's a boat they can sail right and float on
Her goal is to get her mail right and a male right to go ?
She'd rather have a stay home dad
Then a player with cash
She holdin' down and he can pay her for half

[Chorus]:
Just think
Just think
What if she could just
Just blink herself away
Just think
Just think
What if she could just
Just blink herself away
Leave this world already
Forgetting Hell while inhaling faded ?
Tryin' to sink herself in rain
