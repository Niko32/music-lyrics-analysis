Set it on, set it on, set it on
2.5 to the horizon
Set it off, set it off
Set it off, set it off

Oh you know your solid ground
It's paper thin
And oh I want to shut it down
And jack it in
Where do I go
Where do I go
Where do I go
When I want to shut it down
When I want to shut it down

See the weight fall down
It's rising up to hit the ground
Save something for yourself

It's a write off
Set it on, set it on, set it on
2.5 to the horizon
Set it off, set it off
Set it off, set it off
You might also likeMy solid ground
Feels so paper thin
Where do I go
Where do I go
Where do I go
When I want to shut it down
Jack it in, jack it in

See the weight fall down
It's rising up to hit the ground
Save something for yourself

It's a write off
Set it on, set it on, set it on
2.5 to the horizon
Set it off, set it off
Set it off, set it off
