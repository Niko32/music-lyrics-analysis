The crowd roars
It's deep and so unhealthy
The rest you know
I'll feel the hands that felt me

[Chorus 1]
Cold hands
Your hands
Cover my mouth
While I'm staring into bright lights

[Post-Chorus]
Applause
Applause
Applause
Applause
Applause
Applause
Applause
Applause

[Verse 2]
The crowd roars
The gurgling and the groping
The rest you know
Ten lovers violating
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Cured
Discharged
Reach back inside

[Bridge]
Knuckle white
Ruffle white

[Verse 3]
The crowd roars
They ruined and repaired me
The rest you know
The hands removed the bad thing

[Outro]
Miracle
Miracle
Miracle
