A simple room
A little space
That's limited
A four sided room
A shitty room
A space with limits
Everyday each everyday
Fingers move
Prohibited to stop or to rest
In loop can't stop what i'm doing
Silence
Break all
F*ck them all
So what i eat
It's just all junk
My body aches
From all junk food
Starting to rot
My body's gone
I'm here to rot
Just just to rot
Falling down to the deep end
There's no escape
Even though i run it's so useless
I see that you the one with no face
Can't stop...can't stop...can't stop...
No you can't
Have no...have no...
You have no right no
Break all burn all
Break free from all go
F*ck them all
I said f*ck them all
F*ck them all
Pen and compass's all i gotYou might also like
