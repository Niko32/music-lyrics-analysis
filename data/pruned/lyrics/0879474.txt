You're talking fast but talking blind
And I can't bring myself to meet your eyes

Cos death is slowly covering you
In galaxies of black and blue
Oh and under your skin all his colours bloom

And you're only half here
Like someone left a frail body and took the rest
But I remember when you were strong
And never wanted help from no-one
What you've become is not who I remember
Is this the cooling of the embers?

She's back again through summers past
The smell of rain and freshly cut grass
Seems those ordinary days are the ones that last

Oh 'cos he was there, the one you loved
The one you never could let go of
And there's something you know as you're looking up

That your only half here
Like someone left a frail body and stole the rest
But I remember when you were strong
Never wanted help from no-one
What you've become is not who I remember
Is this the cooling of the embers?
You might also likeIs this the cooling of the embers?
Cos you are not who I remember

It's like you are a child, you are a child, you are a child once more
And all of our yesterday's have gone

You put your hand on top of mine
You're talking fast but talking blind
And I can't bring myself to meet your eyes
