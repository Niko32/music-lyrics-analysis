Everybody knows just where to go when there's beer to get
And everybody still drives up that same old hill, for their first kiss
And old man Wilson he still don't know his backfield is the party spot
When the sun goes down, these are my stompin' grounds
Woah, these are my stompin' grounds

[Verse 2]
All my buddies they've been all marryin' their high school sweethearts
And you ain't got enough fingers to count the tractors in our front yards
4 wheel drives are given for gettin' back and forth in my hometown
These are my stomping grounds

[Chorus]
Hey I live here, I'll die here and every time I look around
I see the dirt roads and the wind rows, I know what life is all about, These are my stompin' grounds, yeah
Oh, these are my stompin' grounds

[Verse 3]
Me and my buddies we got ourselves a honey hole back in the pines
And ain't it funny how the bucks we missed get bigger, and bigger every time
I could be a million miles away or 20 minutes from my house, we're forever bound
These are my stompin' grounds

[Chorus]
Hey I live here, I'll die here and every time I look around
I see the dirt roads and the wind rows, I know what life is all about, These are my stompin' grounds, yeah
These are my stompin' grounds, yeah
You might also likeI live here, I'll die here and every time I look around
I see the dirt roads and the wind rows, I know what life is all about, These are my stompin' grounds, yeah
Oh, these are my stompin' grounds, yeah
