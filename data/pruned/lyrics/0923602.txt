Unhappy, well, I should say not
If somebody told me that she cheated
No, I wouldn't believe them 'cause I'm all she's got

I'm the reason that she goes on livin'
Oh, she loves me with all of her heart
No, she can't get enough of my lovin'
She'd be nothin' without me 'cause I'm all she's got

I'm all she's got and that's all I know
Anything else would just kill my soul
I'll be contented, oh, if she never stopped
Saying that she loves me and I'm all she's got

I'll be contented if she never stopped
Saying she loves me and I'm all she's gotYou might also like
