We laughed and joked in the cab of his truck
Just my brother and me
The night before he shipped out overseas
A leatherneck, Jarhead Marine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He said "the Radiator leaks
And the timing-belt is worn
But the Heart and Soul of this old beat up truck
Is The Dashboard."

[Chorus]
"It's seen a lot of tan legs
Got a kick ass radio
Heard a lot of singing along with some country songs
And rock and roll
Got a .38 bullet hole, courtesy of Kate Tillman's dad
A lot of scotch tape marks from holding timeless photographs."
He said "If I don't come back
You can have this Ford
Just tape a picture of me, on the dashboard."

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He said "The paint is peeling off
It's got dents in both the doors
If something happens to me
Don't hang a for-sale sign above the dashboard."

He said "If I don't come back

Just tape a picture of me, on the dashboard."

I Had the Engine overhauled
A paint-job and brand new chrome
I Had her washed and waxed, sittin' in the drive
The day that he came home

I said "Here's the keys
She's all yours
I fixed everything
But the dashboard
