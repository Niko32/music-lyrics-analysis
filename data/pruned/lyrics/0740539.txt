Praise Him under open skies
Everything breathing praising God
In the company of all who love the King
I will dance, I will sing
It could be heavenly
Turn the music loud, life my voice and shout
From where I am
From where I've been
He's been there with me
He's built a monument
His very people
So let his people
Sing, sing, sing

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's so wonderful
Just to be here now

[Chorus]
Praise Him under open skies
Everything breathing praising God
In the company of all who love the King
Praise Him under open skies
Everything breathing praising God
In the company of all who love the King

Just to be here now
It's so wonderful
Just to be here now

Lift up your head and sing
To the One who gave his love
This is our offering
Lift your voice to heaven
Lift up your head and sing
To the One who gave His son
Here our lives we bring
