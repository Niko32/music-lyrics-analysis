Cooler than antifreeze, damn it these rappers be
The baddest thing happening, since King had a dream
Cooler than antifreeze, damn it these rappers be
The baddest thing happening, since King had a dream

[Verse 1: Mibbs]
Pac Div, Knuckleheadz, nothing for you bucket heads
Got my cheese, got my lettuce, now I need my fuckin' bread
Word to baby Darrel, boy I'm hot, habanero
Keep my mind on my money and my eye on the sparrow
Mama I'm the coldest, just from my apparel
Feeling like I'm Moses, flyer than a pharaoh
Tired of all you posers, tired of all you weirdos
Tired of all you hoes leaving make up on my pillows
Shout out my latinos, let's count this dinero
All my niggas eat now, I'm not talking Karo's
Look at all these O's, no, look at all these zeros
I do hella shows, I got cheese like Sbarro
Hello world, hello girls, hello fans, hello haters
We the highly celebrated, number one, one
No they can't stop us, they can't fade us
They can't drop us, they can't break us
We gon' rape this motherfucker 'til we done, done

[Chorus: Mibbs]
Cooler than antifreeze, damn it these rappers be
The baddest thing happening, since King had a dream
Cooler than antifreeze, damn it these rappers be
The baddest thing happening, since King had a dream
Cooler than, cooler than, c-cooler than, cooler than
C-c-cooler than, c-c-cooler than, c-c-cooler than

We let y'all buy 'em drinks, then we take 'em home (Home)
Sean Paul and hoop shorts is all it takes to bone (Bone)
Sat back, peeped game, then we break the code (Code)
This the type of fire motherfuckers can't control
Play the role, shake the mold (Yeah)
Now it's all grizzly (Woo)
Peep a nigga's footwear, now I'm all Italy (Ooh)
Ricky D flashy, nigga, on point Ashley, nigga
Coming up I was influenced by some khaki niggas
Homie 'bout them action figures, homie you can't match the vigor
You ain't really that tough, homie that's the liquor
Popov got you talking fast like you rap with Twista
Give a fuck about a nigga, I go bag they sister
'Nother blunt rap to twist up, another story told
A new Motown Pac Div play that Barry Gordy role
Coming through your audio, switch up like a audible
Run it like it's cardio, take it to the body yo

[Chorus: Mibbs]
Cooler than antifreeze, damn it these rappers be
The baddest thing happening, since King had a dream

Listen, I ain't about drama so I flip my peace sign up
This a south beat but I grew up on East Sidaz
Ay Pac Div poppin' like we got the grease fried up
Looking for a ATL freak to loan me five bucks
Eyes up, eyes up, that is not my wallet miss
Yeah, I'm big headed but don't make it so obvious
I'm travelin' the globe now, workin' on my politics
Running for head of the state on my Barack shit
Cut your fucking head on the plate on some Baraka shit
Every verse I murder I don't care what the topic is
Got a few mistress down in Texas that I poly with
All of them is winners and I coach them like Popovich
Pop the Cris no wait up, pop that Smart Water
Staying sober just in case I gotta dive in shark water
Lady killer, heart-throbber, stick 'em quietly then I release
Then I am peace, deuces like a siamese, gone

[Chorus: Mibbs]
Cooler than antifreeze, damn it these rappers be
The baddest thing happening, since King had a dream
Cooler than antifreeze, damn it these rappers be
The baddest thing happening, since King had a dream
