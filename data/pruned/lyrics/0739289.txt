Carrying on them cruel intentions wicked ways for everyone to see
Lord knows there's far too many people spreading hatred like a disease
So quit all your malcontent and try to love your brother if you please

It's an already mean enough world
No, we don't need no more out of you
So quit your cussing, carrying on and fighting that you do
It's an already mean enough world, baby without you

Don't rope me in your politics or spin me in your tangled web of lies
I do not wish to be weighed down by ugliness nor hear what you despise
Me, I'd rather not be forced to walk a mile in shoes too narrow for my size
So unclench your fists a minute and replace them with some peace of mind

Cause it's an already mean enough world
No, we don't need no more out of you
So quit your cussing, carrying on and fighting that you do
It's an already mean enough world, baby without you

Seems like every way the world goes round
Someone's there to knock you down
Well mama that don't make no sense to me
Them haunted dreams I've laid to rest
The chains you locked around my chest
I've busted loose and now I'm running free
You might also likeWell lately I been thinking that the future holds all our worst fears
That humankind will never learn the lessons of the last three thousand years
It's still an eye an eye and tooth for tooth but it's not too late to lend an ear
And stop all this hating before we all disappear

It's an already mean enough world
No, we don't need no more out of you
So quit your cussing, carrying on and fighting that you do
It's an already mean enough world, baby without you
