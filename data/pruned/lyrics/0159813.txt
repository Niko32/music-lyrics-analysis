People yelling to the sky asking if god is even there
People getting bullies back as if its retribution, wrong people get the death sentence so then they tie the noose and
Drop like bombs or maybe a plane to the sea, government is still the nations enemy
But later they don't give a fuck and say tax season is coming up
And instead of being consistent, these people push their luck
National tragedies happen almost every two months, government acting like they don't know what to do and such
Families don't get to see their veteran enough, life without them feels even more tough
Then what the soldiers do, and truly I'm hoping to
Stop this oil war because what they say it is isn't true

Treyvon Martin the new Emmet Til, except Martin didn't do anything to get killed
Condolences to the family of Till, equality for the world is on bucket list and will
Rodney kings video is backward with Chris Dorner, treating cops like dogs and Michael Vick is the owner
I hope we don't fall back into another bad presidential era, Reagan's is still in effect and it might be that way forever
We're walking backwards forward back to world war 2, holocaust doesn't have to facing again the Jews

I'm for sure you'll still be there rotting as a corpse and of course in the end ill apologize for using brute force
Biblical proportions, leading worlds in distortion, but a certain portion won't care if your Muslim or Mormon
