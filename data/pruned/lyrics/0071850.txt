(verse 1)
Difference in me and you, really all lyrical
Relay my reflection, look and see, im a mirror full
Sunday chour sounds, reach the soul, its spirtual
Smokey rob rythuming, if i blow, its a miracule
Blood on my hands, what, the beat getting killed
State mentally ill, took my man, e pills
E high off pills, thinking, what can we steal
Flowing on a cloud, not the time, he chilled
Solo, wit me nigga, 3 bitches and a 4 doo(r)
Good green, liq-lean, live grande my motto
Twitter tweeting ppl, trending me, now follow
Birdie in my ear, telling me, she gone swallow
Proof is in the pudding, but u rather eat beef
Til im searching for dat ass, so the brother we keep
Pay for wat you saying man, cuz talk ain't cheap
Make up, to break up, dead beauty sleep

(Hook 2x)
Verbally embarrassing, clearly no comparison
Looking all around and its clear no better than
Walton sparks, its walton sparks
Walton sparks, its walton sparks

Case closed, they know, they know, they know
Can't sing, you already, im talking bout that drake song
Best here, have no fear, you def dudes, have no ear
Plane high, at most fly, i stay here, til all clear
You one month, im all year, same speeds, you need gear
M.i.a on rap then comeback, 1, cavalier
Talking all fast, all slick, aww shit, next pick, -auctioneer
Talking all fast, all slick, aww shit, i pick, bitch, waltons here
---------pray for me, knowing that i sin mo'
Plant a pre preception, digging dirty like he can't grow
I could understand if my venting make me so-so
Back at niggas necks, present the biz, with a chock hold
Greatest shit is comin soon, this is jus a premo
Might even be on spanish talk, my other shit amigo
Yo chick get her eagle on, my chick get her kegal on
Most u dudes ain't even on, check mate, fucking pawns

(Hook 2x)
Verbally embarrassing, clearly no comparison
Lookin all around and its clear no better than
Walton sparks, its walton sparks
Walton sparks, its walton sparks
