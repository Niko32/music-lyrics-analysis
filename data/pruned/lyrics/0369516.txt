I ain't down for this rushing maybe we can take it real slow
You know that I’m a Christian so the answer’s gonna be a straight no
Tryna put me in bed but I don’t wanna do it just go
I’ma be singing out, screaming out, trapping out

Baby just leave, baby just leave (oh no)
Baby just leave, baby just leave
Baby just leave, baby just leave (oh no)
Baby just leave, baby just leave
(oh no)

Verse 1

I heard she kinda twerks
In the club it’s all her
She’s zoning out to drunk in love
Been drinking all that drunk in love (pour it up)
All the fellas know she PYT (PYT)
They said get her number & tap that thing (woi)

Every time I roll out she in same spot (same spot)
She’s dressed up smell perfume she’s damn hot (damn hot)
I’m looking at from my window like I’m Guvna B (Guvna B)
Oh my gosh she’s out again with that same T (that's right)
You might also likeCharm charm charm is really deceptive (deceptive)
Don't fall for all that festive
Ain’t nice I’m waiting turn up
Good looks & that sexing's
The wrong reason to be dating
I prefer to be waiting

Baby just leave, baby just leave (oh no)
Baby just leave, baby just leave (oh no)
Baby just leave, baby just leave (oh no)
Baby just leave, baby just leave

Chorus

I ain't down for this rushing maybe we can take it real slow
You know that I’m a Christian so the answer’s gonna be a straight no
Tryna put me in bed but I don’t wanna do it just go
I’ma be singing out, screaming out, trapping out

Baby just leave, baby just leave (oh no)
Baby just leave, baby just leave
Baby just leave, baby just leave (oh no)
Baby just leave, baby just leave
(oh no)
Verse 2
She can make that Pop

She can do do everything that makes a guy just lust (lust)

Too much sneezing like hachhu
I just wanna know that do you love me or for my tissue (pocket)

You maybe looking so fancy with your coloured linens (coloured linens)
Got 6 sense so I'ma leave no super krillen (super krillen)
I'm reading all of these proverbs starting chapter seven
I wanna enter that kingdom coming call it heaven (hahaha)

Charm charm charm is really deceptive (deceptive)
Don't fall for all that festive

Good looks & that sexing's
Ain't down for that kinda dating
I prefer to be waiting
