Go down this hill we can leave the car at Cathedral Park Pier
Her parents used to live right over there
I think they moved; I have no idea where

Now I need some kind of backup plan
To kill this time left on my hands...
Consume the sound of you not there

See the gray-blue house with the picket fence
A half block up on the left off Portsmouth?
That was my tree when I was just a kid
I buried toys in the yard; I'm sure they're still there

Now I need some kind of backup plan
To kill this time left on my hands...
Consume the sound of you not there

Now I need some kind of backup plan
To kill this time left on my hands...
Consume the sound of you not there
You're not there
You're not there

Now I need some kind of backup plan
To kill this time left on my hands...
Consume the sound of you not there
