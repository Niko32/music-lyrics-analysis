Sometimes I look at my own face
And I don't know who I am
I see a piece of everyone I know
Buried underneath my skin

[Chorus]
I don't want to be like them
I wanna crawl back in!

[Verse 2]
It's hard to think of anything
That I haven't heard before
I hear these voices in my head
They could be mine, but I'm not sure

I hear them telling me
Who they think I should be
Why won't they leave me alone?
I can't deny it
I try to fight it
But I'm losing control

[Chorus]
I don't want to be like them
I wanna crawl back in!
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Don't want to lose my innocence
Don't want the world second guessing my heart
Won't let your lies take a piece of my soul
Don't want to take your medicine

I wanna crawl back in!

[Bridge]
Sometimes I lie
Sometimes I crawl
Sometimes I feel like
I wanna die!

[Chorus]
I don't wanna be like them!
I wanna crawl back in!

[Post-Chorus]
Don't want to lose my innocence
Don't want the world second guessing my heart
Won't let your lies take a piece of my soul
Don't want to take your medicine

I wanna crawl back in!
I wanna crawl back in!
I wanna crawl back in!
[Outro]
Hey!
