My pride is gone and here I am on bended knees
I want you and I need you that's all I know
And I'll fight the world before I'll ever let go go
I'll gladly beg I'll steal I will borrow I'll turn my back on everyone I know
I'll do these things with no fear of tomorrow
I'll fight the world before I'll ever let go go
[ ac. Guitar - steel ]
