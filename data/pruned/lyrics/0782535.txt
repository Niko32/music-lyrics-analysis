FACE TO FACE TOE TO TOE

WHERE WE'LL STOP HEAVEN KNOWS

ARM IN ARM CHEEK TO CHEEK

WHOSE TO BLAME?

HAND IN HAND HEART TO HEART

WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE LET THIS START

BUT ITS TO LATE, WE SHARED IT ALL

SO WE'LL JUST HAVE TO SHARE THE BLAME!

I CAN FEEL YOUR BODY TREMBLE

AS I HOLD YOU IN MY ARMS

FOR YOU KNOW ANOTHER WOMAN HAS MY NAME

NOW SHE KNOWS ITS YOU AND ME
You might also likeBUT SHE DON'T WANT TO SET ME FREE

WE'VE SHARED IT ALL NOW ITS TIME TO SHARE THE BLAME!
