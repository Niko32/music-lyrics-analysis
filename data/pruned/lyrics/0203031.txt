Your mother burst in, it was freezing
She said it looks like it's trying to rain
I was lost, I felt seasick
You convinced me that he'd left
You said keep talking but don't use any names

I scolded your driver and your brother
We are old enough to know
How long you've been hooked
And we've all been through the war
And each time you score
Someone gets hauled and handcuffed and booked

It felt like four in the morning
What sounded like fireworks
Turned out to be just what it was
The stars looked like diamonds
And then came the sirens
And everyone started to cuss

All the noise was disturbing
And I couldn’t find Irving
It was like two stations on at the same time
And then I hid your car keys
And I made black coffee
And I dumped out the rest of the rum, hmm

And Candice wouldn't shut up
And Finn, he recorded the whole thing
Ray, he said, "Damn you."
And someone broke my camera
And it was New Year's
And we all started to sing

"Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
For the sake of auld lang syne"

I was leaving in the morning with Charles for Las Vegas
And I didn't ever plan to come back
I had only a few things, $200 dollars
And my records in a brown paper sack, hmm

I ran out on Sheila
Everything's in storage
Calvin’s right, I should go back to driving truck

"Should auld acquaintance be forgot
And never brought to mind
Should auld acquaintance be forgot
For the sake of auld lang syne"
