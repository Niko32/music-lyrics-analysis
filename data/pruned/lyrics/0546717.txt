Baby you're on fire
Nobody does it better, than you
I bet you're feeling good tonight
If not, well then I'll change that right now
I hope your getting closer
I want you too
So baby do it nice
And we gone do it right
So if I never let you go and never break this hold from you
(Yeah man)
I never wanted someone this bad, always picked the wrong ones, but you

[Pre Chorus]
You, you, you take me higher
You make me feel so right, oh girl, you inspire
Me to be here through the night (oh girl, baby)

[Chorus]
Its me and you so lets let it on the table
Girl its not a lot to handle, I don't want nobody but you
Nobody but you, so baby
Girl just say just say,  your with me
I don't want nobody but you nobody baby
Nobody cause nobody baby nobody does it better

Oh girl your so pretty
And I'm glad you're my lady
And I'm glad you're staying right here
For long your staying right here with me
And girl it's your mind that makes you the hottie you are
Lay your hand in mine
And will be together
So if you take time, take time with me
Imma show you what this fella could do

[Pre Chorus]
You you you take me higher
You make me feel so right oh girl you inspire
Me to be here through the night

[Chorus]
Its me and you so lets let it on the table
Girl its not a lot to handle, I don't want nobody but you
Nobody but you, so baby
Girl just say just say,  your with me
I don't want nobody but you nobody baby
Nobody cause nobody baby nobody does it better
