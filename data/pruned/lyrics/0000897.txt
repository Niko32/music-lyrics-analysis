Or the big dick bandit
Say he had a big dick
But I thought it was random
Then he pull out the fuckin’ Magnum Trojan condom
And he said, ”baby, that’s not how it begin”
Then he brought in all of his 7th floor friends
She found out there was more to Miami than just a football team
There’s also the 7th floor king ding-a-ling
She thought 5-2 was just my number, then she realized
You multiply the bitch up, dog, you get my dick size
First I put it in the pussy, then in the butt
That’s all fo' her, dog, the condom is filled up
