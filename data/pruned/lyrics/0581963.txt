And your trash talk don't stop carry on
Shame on you it feels so cruel when you don't reply
Must be a lash stuck in my eye

If I could spin the bottle and choose
Seven minutes in heaven with you
And you don't even have to try
Could this be love in a drunk dial?

Dreamphone I'm all alone
Baby I tried to call but there was no one home
Dreamphone this ain't no game
I wanna call you up to hear you say my name

Devils on my shoulders and they don't stop daring me
This girl talk so sweet it rots my teeth
You could be my boy my angel with dirty wings
Your halo made from a smoke ring
If I could spin the bottle and choose
Seven minutes in heaven with you
And you don't even have to try
Could this be love in a drunk dial?

Dreamphone I'm all alone
Baby I tried to call but there was no one home
Dreamphone this ain't no game
I wanna call you up to hear you say my name
You might also likeI should get a so called life
Instead of waiting up all night
You could get me off the hook
I should just read a magazine
Dreamphone I'm all alone
Baby I tried to call but there was no one home
Dreamphone this ain't no game
I wanna call you up to hear you say my name
