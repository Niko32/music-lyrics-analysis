Attention please, please brace for impact
P Money arrival in 5, 4, 3, 2, 1

[Verse 1]
P, this one's mean
Call it a nightmare, so not a dream
Crowd goes mad, all the girls scream
When they see me, Benga and Skream
This one's mad, letting off steam
P Money's bad, missed enough streams
You wanna know how they know that it's me?
Ratata, how'd you mean?
I'm on a high, you're just lean
I put on a show they never seen
Slang Like This took over the scene
Cool, safe, blood, seen
I sound like money, it's in my genes
It's on my card, it's in my jeans
How can I blast when the blast is me?
You're just an X Woman like Jean

[Hook x2]
The most respected member
I make the vibe much better
Bouncing left, bouncing right
Cause I'm the dubstepper
Real gyal collector
Real trendsetter
We party so hard
The next day no one can remember

[Verse 2]
P, this one's sick
Call it a madman, so not a chick
Crowd goes mad, girls go skitz
It's dub mania, this ain't the BRITs
They're like "how come your tune's big?"
Mine goes bang, your one clicks
It's an air raid live on the airwaves
Return of the blitz
You should've called this one stupid
The kick is dumb, bass is thick
Levels are high, yours are lit
Mine gets rinsed, yours gets mixed
You can't tell me to do shit
Do it yourself, get down to it
I'm really here, forget all the wigs
Cause I'm P, and I'm the

Ratatata
You are locked into the sound of P Money
Nothing but bass in your system
This is the takeover, are you ready?

[Outro/Hook]
Step aside, step aside, cause we're going in
Bouncing left, bouncing right
Cause I'm the dubstepper
This is a P Money world that we're living in
We party so hard
The next day no one can remember
Give it up, give it up, you can never win
Bouncing left, bouncing right
Cause I'm the dubstepper
This is a P Money world that we're living in
We party so hard
The next day no one can remember
