I would crawl through burnin' sand
I would face thunder and lightnin'
Just for the touch of your hand

Late at night I lie awake and
Watch the lonely shadows dance
There's no end to all this longing
Just for the touch of your hand

Bridge
Sometimes I hate you for the way
You made me love you
Sometimes I wish I'd never
Heard you whisper my name

People say I should be stronger
But they'll never understand
The power of desire
Just for the touch of your hand

Repeat bridge

Repeat first verse

Just for the touch of your hand
Just for the touch of your handYou might also like
