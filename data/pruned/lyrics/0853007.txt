To get me all worked up for you each night?
You've got my number, and I don't know what to do
'Cause I've been left here black and blue

I guess you took me down a peg
Is this the part where I'm supposed to beg?
Well, when I'm in this state, I don't know what to do
'Cause I've been left here black and blue

Call the rockets back, I'm turning back to you
Shouting out the answers in advance to you
It's the pop that makes you dance
In a melancholy trance
As I'm crawling back to you

What makes you think I'm gonna bite?
Could it be all the times I proved you right?
You've got me dead to rights, I don't know what to do
'Cause I've been left here black and blue

I twist and toss and turn and fall apart for you
And I've gotta turn it off
Yeah, I've gotta turn it off
Yeah, I've gotta turn it off
But I wanna turn it upYou might also like
