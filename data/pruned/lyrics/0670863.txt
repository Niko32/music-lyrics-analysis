Birthday boy, blow out the candles
Good friends around you, you should feel OK
Don't look so sad and blue
Don't act forsaken, this day's for you

[Chorus: Peter Cetera]
Good days are coming, my friend
Life can be easy until the end

[Verse 2: Peter Cetera]
Birthday boy, don't fear tomorrow
Changes before you, years drift away
You see life as pictures, frame to frame
Many years wasted, what a shame

[Chorus: Peter Cetera]
Good days are coming, my friend
Life can be easy until the end

[Verse 3: Peter Cetera]
That empty feeling won't go away
Caught up in hurting, day after day
When will you see the joy in your life?
It's there for you, it's there for you
You might also like[Outro: Peter Cetera]
Don't look so sad and blue
Don't act forsaken, this day's for you
Good days are coming, once you stop running
Life could be easy, easy for you
