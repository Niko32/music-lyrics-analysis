Like confetti everywhere
Hidden sorrows in the dark
You can feel it in the air
The spotlight finds me
I can no longer hide my frown
Say hello to a lover's clown

Distorted mirror images
Turn the good to bad
If that's not the way it is
Why am I so sad?
Strangers laughter is the only sound
Silence from a lover's clown

Girl that's me everybody's laughing at
With a big red nose and the tears and the silly act
Comedy, tragedy, reality
It all plays the same
If you don't want me

Tumbling from the high wire
Without a net
You're saying I'll stop falling for you
But I haven't yet
The spotlight dims and the bigtop's coming down
Curtains o'er the lover's clown
You might also likeGirl, that's me everybodies laughing at
With a big red nose and the tears and the silly act
Comedy, tragedy, reality
It all plays the same
If you don't want me

Tiny peices of my heart
Scattered everywhere
Like a fool I played my part
But you were never really there
A new day dawns and the bigtop's leaving town
You can say goodbye to a lover's clown
Say goodbye
