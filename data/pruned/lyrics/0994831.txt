I'm sorry for saying all the things that I said to you
When I was just trippin', plus you know
When I get mad that's the way I do

I know I drive you crazy sometimes
But baby, that's the way I am
That's why you love me
That's why you want me

If you walk away baby I'll have nothing
I'll play my cards right girl no more bluffin'
'Cause I don't ever want to lose you baby

You drive me crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Even though you drive me crazy, I still love you boy
Oh, you amaze me, amaze me, amaze me, amaze me
I didn't know I amazed you that's why I still want you boy

I know you hate when I work real late
And I walk into the crib at a half past eight
But listen I'm working hard trying to get this paper
Doing bigger numbers so many stats will raise up

And now you talking like you wanna break up, please
I try to leave and you be sittin' on my car keys
You know you love all the things that I bring to ya
Let the water boy sing to ya
You might also likeSugar baby, I want you to know
I can't leave you 'cause I love you so

You drive me crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Even though you drive me crazy, I still love you boy
Oh, you amaze me, amaze me, amaze me, amaze me
That's why I still want you boy

Baby, I know I drive you crazy
But you know I still love you girl
Baby, I know I drive you crazy
But you know I still love you girl

Baby, I know I drive you crazy
But you know I still love you girl
Baby, I know I drive you crazy

You drive me crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Even though you drive me crazy I still love you boy
Oh, you amaze me, amaze me, amaze me, amaze me
I didn't know I amazed you that's why I still want you boy

Crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
Even though you drive me crazy I still love you boy
Oh, you amaze me, amaze me, amaze me, amaze me
That's why I still want you boy
Baby, I know I drive you crazy
But you know I still love you girl
Baby, I know I drive you crazy
But you know I still love you girl

Baby, I know I drive you crazy
But you know I still love you girl
Baby, I know I drive you crazy
