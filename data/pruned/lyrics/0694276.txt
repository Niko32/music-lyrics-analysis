Sometimes I feel discouraged
And think my work in vain
I'm tempted oft' to murmur
To grumble and complain
But then I think of Jesus
And all he'd borne for me
Then I cry, oh rock of ages
Hide thou me

[Verse]
Oh rock of ages
Hide thou me
No other refuge
Can save but thee
Through this old world
I've wandered so far, far from thee
Then I cry, oh rock of ages
Hide thou me

[Verse]
Oh rock of ages
Hide thou me
No other refuge
Can save but thee
Through this old world
I've wandered so far, far from thee
Then I cry, oh rock of ages
Hide thou meYou might also like
