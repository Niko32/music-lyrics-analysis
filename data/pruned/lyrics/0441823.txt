I'm here, reppin' the Chi
Saying fuck the other states
Taking over the game
Sitting on my throne
Ain't Nobody taking my place
Everybody got a nation
Every block and every race
Showing love and shakes
Tear drops up on they face
Most of my fam is all SGD's
Two my cousins; Dragons
My pops is Latin Kings
My cousin ? always doing their thing
In the battlefield, holding up the block
For the shit they got to live
Right now its too much time to tell for this proposition
My cousins going at it, cause they oppositions
? lil niggas so they can pull the mission
Its funny sell out niggas be ? for street recognition
Right now the streets ? is worse
Ain't no one give a fuck
They too busy on the block where niggas posted up
Chi-Town gangsta started
This shit ain't fading
Everyday my niggas on the block
Pushing weight gang bangin'

[Verse 2]
We suppose to be for the love
And not the hatred
But every nation getting weaker
Funerals keep enraging
Folks attackin' to right
People pushin' to the left
Seekin' lames on the streets
While real niggas hit the ?
?
Every block ? keep asking niggas
(Hey what you ride?)
Black and blue, black and gold
Black and red, black and yellow
GD's, Latin Kings, Vicelords, and Disciples
All the soldiers working hard
Showing love for the hood
Wrapping up to the bullets
Cause that's what they understood
?




[Verse 3]
I'm the Chi-town representative for People and the Folks
They working all year long ?
Most are born in the block
So it's not like the chose
On some real shit, it's crazy on the streets
We're the murder capital
Ain't no Bloods and Crips
Only
Ain't no Black and Yellow, no matter what you is
Acting like a bitch, no matter if you're big or small
?
? that's why the stupid niggas get murked
