To the Tennesse waltz....
When an old friend I happened to see.....
I introduced him..... to my loved one......
And while they were waltzing.....
My friend stole..... my sweet-heart from me

I remember the night.... and the Tennessee waltz
Now I know just.... how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darlin'....
The night they were playing....
The beautiful Tennessee waltz

I was waltzing with my darlin'
To the Tennesse waltz

When an old friend I happened to see
I introduced him to my loved one
And while they were waltzing
My friend stole my sweet-heart from me

I remember the night.... and the Tennessee waltz
Now I know just.... how much I have lost
Yes I lost my little darlin'....
The night they were playing....
