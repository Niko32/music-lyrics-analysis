Man, you know thoughts have been chasing my mind
Yo sometimes i feel like I'm not in the proper place for me
That I'm living with the wrong people and surroundings
Like i wanna fade away from this chaos, and search
For wherever i can be hugged, where my state of mind
Can be embraced

(Verse1)
Have you ever thought, that you needed a bigger chance
To prove em dead wrong and how eager is your ink
How bitter are my friends, why i even call em so
The interaction i know and assent to
Is that come hell or high water
If they set me bottomward i'll
Recur more potty like oil over water
Once i peed in this toy i made it hotter
I used to draft the sun on the border
And turn my eye from the clouds
I spent a tall time tryna figure what they want
Pissing farts about what they like and what they don't
Set up my art toilet, swallowed parasite thoughts
Guess they're all here just to see me fallin upstairs
And worry bout myself, like are you ready to do this
Start bitchin like they cool it
They want cut me some slack
Talkin wack behind my back in case they cast off my shit
They'll be holding up my throat from the wing as a marionette

Sometimes i feel like i don't belong to this place
And this is just my fate
I feel like I'm not familiar
Inside the terror of what I'm gonna be
Tell me where to escape

(Verse2)
What's in my pot will be put out in the noon on the dishes
Or the night early or later, by the seven midgets
The verity in making poetry out a language i don't talk
Is similar to rapping in hieroglyphics
Takin pills and chillin out on lies ain't a choice to be my choice
These eyes will turn apologetic a day
See i'll never forget from where i be, a malicious highland
So a target i won't be, naa man
I feel like I'm prayin for the lottery of esteem
I mean loudly that I'm not proud of my country
I mean what you did anarchy, but what was the gift
To the minds of state, you just mucked around
And diminshed your bounderies
Anemics, they speak easy
That's why your husbands are womanish
Prohibit the genius ish of a child
Til he agrees to keep em half-witted
So permit your souls to join the hall of rescue

Dear mates, hater, parents and mentors
I promise i won't act like you want me too
My point of view is big, ya dig
Can fill all your crew, i came here to salute
So the reception was full of baloons of fire
Feeling stuck and tired, with my teeth liftin my
Life wire i don't wanna toss a coin high then
See if i can keep going or freeze before that line
I wanna decide my essence by my own will
Tryna adress people with letters that they can deal
They say actions speak more than words
So i knocked a hoe down and said did you hear
Must of yall hate me coz the image in me
They seeing and
If everybody turns against me
And the colours so cimmerian
My heart's my shadow, with no dreams
I'm not accompanied
So what you're comin for to take from me
You better watch your steps
Coz mine are speechless infintely
