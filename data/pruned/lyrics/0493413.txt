Well, Jacksonville, Louisiana, that's the crazy house called the insane asylum, you know. And t'was a man he had a pretty wife with all the women... pretty good looking and he, she went losed her mind by the husband. So, down at Jacksonville, Louisiana, we'd go out and play, we had a 8-piece band. And we'd go out and play for the insane asylum people and they would dance. Well, this girl, her husband was there, she was there. Her husband would go out there all the time and we'd go and he would sing to her. And when she - two women had her sit her right down where she could look dead at her husband and the other stood over here. I'm on one side of the husband, Victor he could play the clarinet, he was on the other side. He was in the middle and he'd sing this song

Now, listen, 1-2-3 time is waltz time...

Dancing with...
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
Dancing with somebody new
When it's you that my heart is calling to

I am trying to smile once in a while
But I find that it wouldn't do
Dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you

Dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you
Dancing with somebody new
When it's you that my heart is calling to

I am trying to smile once in a while
But I find that it wouldn't do
Dancing with tears in my eyes
'Cause the girl in my arms isn't you

See, that and she went back to him and went back to her senses. So they're together right now and have got a family. So you see, you know, how music can bring you back. If you ain't too far gone, if you just realise, you'll come back, that's right. And it made her, you know, go back to her husband. Now it's gonna be this. If you want somebody let them go, and I'm gonna give you this...
