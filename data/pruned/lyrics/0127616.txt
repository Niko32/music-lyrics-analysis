It's 2A.M. in my new home
This motel room
An ashtray full of lucky strikes
A half spent case of warm Bud Lite

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Countin' regrets
Fghtin' back tears
Retracin' steps
Gettin' nowhere

[Chorus]
Callin' your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this cold and empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion where there's no love left
It's like tryna put smoke back... in this cigarette

[Verse 2]
Come sunrise, guess I'll check out
And ditch this town
Put a few more miles between us
And keep drivin' 'til I finally mend this broken trust

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Hangin' my hopes
On highway signs
If I lie here
I'll lose my mind
You might also like[Chorus]
Callin' your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this cold and empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion where there's no love left
It's like tryna put smoke... back in this cigarette

[Bridge]
I may never know
Your reasons why
But someday I'm gonna see the good
In your goodbye

[Chorus]
Callin' your name, it's a waste of my breath
There's no reachin' you across this empty bed
Stirrin' up ashes, tryin' to find passion where there's no love left
It's like tryna put smoke... back in this cigarette
