I'm better off here at home alone in my bathtub
Looking at these pictures of myself looking fucked up
Are you fucked enough? Get the fuck up
Boys hands up and girls rub your jugs but
Boys stand back and don't you fucking touch us
We're untouchable
Our blood runs through our veins like you
The same blood, but better tasting
You'll catch on sooner or later
You see me sweating? glowing like an atom bomb
Because that sweat is the move and the constant
Better yet it's the movement that I wanted
The second coming like the first wave of your mom's vomit
I'm on it, don't concern yourself I've got this shit conquered
I was born in the darkness
And I'm just being honest

I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest
I'm just being honest

I'm not shy to meet you
(I'm not shy)
(I'm not shy)
I'm dying to meet you
(I'm not shy)
(I'm not shy)
I'm dying to meet you
You might also likeSometimes I hear your voice in my head
But I'm used to living in impossible darkness
I see light never and I'm not minding sparks lit
I'm touching gold always and I'm cheap riding harsh split
Sick like the winner of your favourite mosh pit
Big dick like you promised all your varsity classmates
I see past the prison of your masterpiece heartrate
And the pictures that you take of how nasty your scars mark hate
I'm nasty baby, you can't escape me
I'm nasty baby
I'm nasty baby
I'm nasty baby
Nasty mcNasty Baby
Nasty McNasty Baby


I'm not shy to meet you
(I'm not shy)
(I'm not shy)
I'm dying to meet you
(I'm not shy)
(I'm not shy)
I'm dying to meet you

(I'm not shy)
(I'm not shy)
(I'm not shy)
(I'm not shy)
(I'm not shy)
(I'm not shy)
Take back the purpose
I'm dying to meet you
