Taking back wasted time that we have spent
Walking 'round wasted, tracing back the steps
Oh I can taste it, the secret I have kept
Walking 'round wasted, and I'll take what I can get

[Interlude: Lemaitre]
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa

[Chorus: Lemaitre]
Taking back wasted time that we have spent
Walking 'round wasted, tracing back the steps
Oh I can taste it, the secret I have kept
Walking 'round wasted

[Bridge: Lemaitre]
It's how I feel
Too late to turn
It's how I deal with you
Too late to turn
It's how I feel

[Chorus: Lemaitre]
Taking back wasted
Oh I can taste it
It's how I feel
Walking 'round wasted
The secret I have kept
Walking 'round wasted
Take what I can get

Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa
