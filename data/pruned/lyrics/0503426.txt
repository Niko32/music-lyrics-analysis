Their fathers, their mothers
Their sisters, their brothers
And all of their children to death
Such casualness

Do you not know unless
You caress their bodies
As they got undressed

She smiles, shrugs off her clothes
Says that’s when I know
The only thing keeping you here
Is the time that you spend
With the money they send
To keep you in love and warm beer

And the feeling comes and goes
And after all that don’t you know
That you’re still bound to fall
And love can kill you after all

And so when she goes
And cries at your feet
You can’t help but wonder
At the deceit that you’ve spun
And who you’ve become
And where’d she go wrong
To put up with this for so long?

He looks for his daughter
On the pornography shelves
Of Woolworths and Boots
God they look so cute
Done up in their nude birthday suits

And the feeling comes and goes
And after all that don’t you know
That you’re just going to laugh
Like those fat kids in the photographs

And the feeling comes and goes
And you can mop up. Don’t you know
That we’re all bound to fall
And love can kill you after all?
