Got people in cages
Powered up from the tunes
They powered up from the shrooms
And the glasses raising
Then I take a sip
From the red lips, of a chick
With some bad hips
Aw fuck I need a grip
Before I’m on a guilt trip
Now off I stumble
Only a mumble
Moving through the jungle
Out of my habitat
Scurried across
Real real fast
Young bad rattat
Avoiding mortal kombat
Can't function with my drunk ass
Just off in a daze
Seems like I’ve been walking for days
Thinking thats a local coffee shop
Good
Cause I need a wake up call from a coffee pot
Before my blood get hot
Then I won’t stop
Awh too late
Can’t escape my fate
Cause I’m on a rampage.I’m on a rampage
Someone stop me, someone stop me
I’m on a rampage. I’m on a rampage
Someone stop me. Someone stop me
