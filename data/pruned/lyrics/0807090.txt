Able to live (won't you love?)...

Push me
And then just touch me
Till I can get my
Satisfaction

Push me
And then just touch me
Till I can get my
Satisfaction, satisfaction, satisfaction
Satisfaction, satisfaction

Able to live, able to love (push, push)...

Satisfaction (able to live)

Push, push, push...

Push me
And then just touch me
Till I can get my
Satisfaction

Nobody's business if I
Walk, talk, make love, sing
But I'm able to love

Lalalala...

Push, push, push...

Push me
And then just touch me
Till I can get my
Satisfaction
