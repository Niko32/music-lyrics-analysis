Why can't you see you torture me?
You're already thinking about someone else
When he comes home you'll be in his arms
And I'll be gone

[Chorus]
But i know, my day will come
I know someday, I'll be the only one

[Verse 2]
You wait for his spark
You know it'll turn you on
He's going to make you feel
The way you want to feel
When he starts to lie
Makes you cry
You know I'll be there

[Chorus]
My day will come
I know someday I'll be the only one

[Bridge]
Call me selfish
Call me what you like
I think its right
To want someone for all your own
And not share her love
And i'll have my way
And you won't have a say
Anyway
You don't stand a chance!
You might also like[Verse 3]
You wait for his cock
You know it'll turn you on
He's going to make you feel
The way you want to feel
When he starts to lie
Makes you cry
You know I'll be there

[Chorus][x2]
My day will come
I know someday I'll be the only one

[Verse 4]
You want perfection
See your self-destruction
You don't know what you want
It's going to take you years to find out!
Not giving up
And when you've had enough
You'll take your bruised little head and
You'll come running right back to me!

[Outro]
I will be the only one[x2]
