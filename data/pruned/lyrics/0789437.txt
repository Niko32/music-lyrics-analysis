I imbibe the libation
I control the regression
To a boy
Early passion (?)
It's alright
It's all clean to eat
If god says yes
Don't drag your feet
Eat drink and be merry
You voluptuary
When the spirit is willing
And the flesh ain't weak
I subscribe to sensation
I imbibe the libation
It's alright
Ah, take and eat
If god says yeah
Don't drag your feet
Eat drink and be merry
You voluptuary
When the spirit is willing
And the flesh ain't weakYou might also like
