Time drags by when you miss someone
We say hello and we say goodbye
Coming and going at the speed of life

You start out crawling then you learn to walk
You run into someone and then you fall
The band plays on as worlds collide
Drums keep beating at the speed of life

Come on baby ride with me
Four strong winds, seven deep seas
A big blue ball flying through space
Can't turn back not a minute to waste
Womb to the tomb, blink of an eye
Everything's moving at the speed of life

Well I don't know what the future holds
But I been watching the river flow
It can sink quick and it can rise high
Always rolling at the speed of life

Come on baby ride with me
Four strong winds, seven deep seas
A big blue ball flying through space
Can't turn back not a minute to waste
Womb to the tomb, the blink of an eye
Everything's moving at the speed of life
Lady luck, father time
Everything's moving at the speed....of lifeYou might also like
