Oh, what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone, I have no more friends
To wish me greetings, oh, once again

Choirs will be singing "Silent Night"
Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas then by New Years night

Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
But this is Christmas, yes, Christmas, my dear
Oh, the time of year to be with the ones you love

So won't you tell me you'll never more roam
Christmas and New Years will find you at home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy it's Christmas once again

Oh, there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy that it's Christmas once againYou might also like
