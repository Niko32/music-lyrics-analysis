Scared from pictures I have seen
Afraid of things that Hide away
Deep in my soul, I start to break
My dreams end of future
I will be real, or just illusion
In dreams like good hurt cause my hate hurt
I realize it's my own nature

My soul be there to fly
To go in bloodrage far away
My forces call you my eyes is blind
You'd be done to evil try to pray
My windows open I may broked in
A sin to free me from my sin
All of my dream have been a pain
From the darkest pain
All of this wicked dream is scared from the church I have seen
Afraid of things that hide away deep in my soul
I start to pray

My soul be there to fly
To call the bloodrage far away
My forces call you my eyes is blind
You,d be done to evil, try to pray
My soul be there to fly
To call the bloodrage far away
My forces call you my eyes is blind
You,d be done to evil, try to prayYou might also like
