Like the sun here in November
Almost a smile

Almost a smile
Lakes that glitter behind trees
Blinking lamps in dusky streets
Almost a smile

Almost a smile
Like the bliss of northern summer
Hopefulness with the newcomer
Very casual and unstable
Like a guest will leave the table

Like a day when nothing happens
You were sure the worst would happen
Almost a smile

Like a word that isn't worthless
That you haven't heard in lies yet
Almost a smile
Almost a smile

Like the presence of a stranger
When you've lived in constant danger
Almost a smile
You might also likePassing cars, surprising comfort
Like the lover at the airport
Almost a smile
Almost a smile
