I can kick any habit, that is if I want to
Or I can lay off whatever I'm on
But of all the things that I've been a slave to
Hey, you're the one thing I can't leave alone

[Chorus]
I can't break the habit, love is too strong
I can't take the cure now, I've been hooked too long
I crave your loving wouldn't quit if I could
I can't break the habit, Lord, the habit's too good

[Verse 2]
I can stay off the bottle, be straight if I want to
Or I can stay high till the curtain comes down
I used to get around love and move on if I had to
But you're the one thing I can't get around

[Chorus]
I can't break the habit, love is too strong
I can't take the cure now, I've been hooked too long
I crave your loving wouldn't quit if I could
I can't break the habit, Lord, the habit's too good

[Chorus]
I can't break the habit, love is too strong
I can't take the cure now, I've been hooked too long
I crave your loving wouldn't quit if I could
I can't break the habit, the habit's too goodYou might also like
