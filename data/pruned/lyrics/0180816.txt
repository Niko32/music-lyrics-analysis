Comes a time when you're driftin'
Comes a time when you settle down
Comes a light, feelings liftin'
Lift that baby right up off the ground

[Chorus]
Oh, this old world keeps spinnin' 'round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time

[Verse 2]
You and I, we were captured
We took our souls and we flew away
We were right, we were giving
That's how we kept what we gave away

[Chorus]
Oh, this old world keeps spinnin' 'round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Oh, this old world keeps spinnin' 'round
It's a wonder tall trees ain't layin' down
There comes a time
There comes a time
You might also like[Outro]
Comes a time, comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
Comes a time
