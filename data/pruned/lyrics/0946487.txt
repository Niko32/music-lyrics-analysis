Hush, can't you see what is there?
Don't wake the lost
It's all just around you and
Hush, can't you see what is there?
Counting the cost
Oh, it's all just around you

[Verse]
Waking up a moment
Finding you're not there
Is all that's left
I promised us forever
Hiding out the feelings
All that can rest

[Refrain]
So, oh, won't you sing a song?
Oh, won't you sing a song for me?
And I will sing along
I will sing along, you'll see

[Chorus]
Hush, can't you see what is there?
Shadow and soaps
Oh, it's all just around you
And hush, can't you see what is left?
Of these hollow bones
It's all just around you
You might also like[Verse]
Waking up a moment
Finding you're not there
Is all that's left
I promised us forever
Hiding out the feelings
All that can rest

[Refrain]
So, oh, won't you sing a song?
Won't you sing a song for me?
And I will sing along
I will sing along, you'll see

[Refrain]
And oh, won't you sing a song?
Oh, won't you sing a song for me?
And I will sing along
I will sing along, you'll see

[Outro]
Hush, can't you see what is there?
Don't wake the lost
Oh, it's all just around you
