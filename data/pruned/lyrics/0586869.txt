And from this groove came the groove of all grooves
And while one day viciously throwing down on his box, Jack boldly declared
"Let there be House!" and house music was born
"I am, you see
I am the creator, and this is my house!
And in my house there is only house music
But, I am not so selfish because once you enter my house it then becomes our house and our house music!"
And, you see, no one man owns house because house music is a universal language, spoke and understood by all
You see, house is a feeling that no one can understand really unless you're deep into the vibe of house
House is a uncontrollable desire to jack your body
And, as I told you before, this is our house and our house music
And in every house, you understand, there is a keeper
And, in this house, the keeper is Jack
Now some of you who might wonder
"Who is Jack, and what is it that Jack does?"
Jack is the one who gives you the power to jack your body!
Jack is the one who gives you the power to do the snake
Jack is the one who gives you the key to the wiggly worm
Jack is the one who learns you how to walk your body
Jack is the one that can bring nations and nations of all Jackers together under one house
You may be black, you may be white; you may be Jew or Gentile. It don't make a difference in our house
And this is fresh!

My house, my music
My house, my music
My house, my music
My house, my music
This is my house and my music
And the music's turning me out
This is my house and my music
And the music's turning me out
This is my house and my music
And the music's turning me out
House music, turning me on
House music, turning me on
House music, turning me on
House music, turning me on
House music, turning me on
House music, turning me on
House music, turning me on
House music, turning me on
This is my house and my music
And the music's turning me out
I am the keeper of this house
And my name's Jack

To do what you wanna do
[?]

And let Jack take over your mind
