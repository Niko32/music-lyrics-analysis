I need a little more than 5 to 9
I need a little more than two days and two nights
I got a little cash
Yeah, my baby knows it
What good is money if you ain’t got time to blow it?

[Chorus]
Can’t wait, can’t wait, can’t wait for the weekend
Can’t wait to have a good time
I can’t wait, can’t wait, can’t wait for the weekend
Gonna start my weekend tonight

[Verse 2]
Everybody knows it’s now or never
Everybody knows it’s good and gettin’ better
Catch a little buzz
Crank it up and cut loose
If you’re anything like me, aw yeah, I bet that you

[Chorus]


[Bridge]
Friday, Saturday, and Sunday is fine
But I’m up for anything on any day that ends in “Y”
Wait, why wait, why wait for the weekend?
Why wait to have a good time?
