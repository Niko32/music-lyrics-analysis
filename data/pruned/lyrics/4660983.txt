Are you okay?
Been starin' at your face
From across the room now
You seem out of place

[Verse 2]
It's a new day
The people know your name
They smile when they see you
So why the long face?
Oh, oh

[Verse 3]
Back on my shit, my bullshit that is
It feels so good to hold you in my arms
We both know it's wrong
(You want me in your arms)
I sing these songs, it's therapy
You need me to see right through you
Like you see through me

[Chorus]
Me and my niggas gettin' paper
Highly blessed and highly favoured
We ain't askin' for no favours
We in Cali smokin' hella flavors
Me and my niggas gettin' paper
Highly blessed and highly favoured
We ain't askin' for no favours
We in Cali smokin' hella flavors

[Interlude]
Sweet Emily, my bride to be
Struggle with me, If I'd entropy

[Refrain]
Chef Boyarcaese
So cookin' up trouble like, "Woe is me"
This shit ain't easy
I know I piss my girl off but, oh, Heavens, why'd she leave me? Why'd she leave me?
Chef Boyarcaese
So cookin' up trouble like, "Woe is me"
This shit ain't easy
I know I piss my girl off but, oh, Heavens, why'd she leave me?

[Verse 4]
I watch the snow melt slowly day-by-day
Three nights passed it all melted away
I know it will return and while things may have changed
It's essence stays the same, all things always

[Interlude]
Sweet Emily, my bride to be
Struggle with me, If I'd entropy
[Outro]
Emily, please don't be my enemy
You were such a friend to me
I'm sorry for my energy
I'm sorry for my—
Rest assured
Today I won't be insecure
You deserve the world and more
Next time I'll knock at your door
Next time I'll knock—
