I found a friend, someone to help me
And a place I can be myself when I'm in trouble now
And I've lost it and I don't know how
I come to you 'cause you can show me
Get me back to the me I know with a remedy
Baby, I need your therapy

[Pre-Chorus]
With your healing kiss, you know how to make my mind relax
I will listen to the words you say and just lie back

[Chorus]
Talk to my heart, that's where real talking starts
Words of love that cut straight to my heart
Ooh, reach out and touch, so few words say so much
I can hear you when you tell it like it is
When you talk straight to my heart

[Verse 2]
I guess it shows I need attention
Somehow you're asking all the right questions that I've gotta say
What's been on my mind these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know, you know just how to make my mind react
When it's coming straight from you, that's my first point of contact
Ooh
You might also like[Chorus]
Talk to my heart, that's where real talking starts
Words of love that cut straight to my heart
Ooh, reach out and touch, so few words say so much
I can hear you when you tell it like it is
When you talk straight to my

[Bridge]
I'm bad at making decisions
But being alone with you just feels so right
Feels so right
I'm losing my inhibitions
With every minute I share with you tonight
Share it with you tonight, oh
Talk, talk to me
To my heart, to my heart, oh yeah
Come on, come on, and reach out
'Cause the words just mean so much
I can hear you
When you talk right to my heart

[Chorus]
Talk to my heart, that's where real talking starts
Words of love that cut straight to my heart
Ooh, reach out and touch, so few words say so much
I can hear you when you tell it like it is
When you talk straight to my heart
[Outro]
I can hear you, I can hear you
I can hear you
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I can hear you
I can hear you when you talk to my heart
