Dust in the wind
I led a hard life
I led a hard life

Close my eyes
Only for a moment
And the moment's gone
All we do
Crumbles to the ground
And we refuse to see

Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind

I led a hard life (Repeat)

Same old sound
Just a drop of water
In an endless sea
In all you do
And not another minute
Oh no, no more goodbye, bye, bye

Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
You might also likeI led a hard life
I led a hard life
……
Wwonder
I don't know
What about…
And we stick it assunder
Out of coming up in this world
And it's bringing me under
And as I can make it this far
I know just who we are
We must be dust

Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
Dust in the wind
All we are is dust in the wind
I led a hard life
I led a hard life
