You should know
We'll be right here with you
As you come to your end
Though some may say to end
Is to begin again
I love the notion of
A body and a soul;
You're never truly gone
You're just intangible

[Hook]
And I can learn to live with that
It's just a part of of life
We are but temporary mass
We're only part of time

[Verse 2]
What can be said?
I'll never comprehend
The story that you've lead
The road is far too long;
A tale for every bend

[Hook]
And even words told at that their best
Could never paint your eyes
But what we learn when faced with death
Is "celebrate life"

You should know
You won't go by yourself
I'm with you 'til it's on
A song so beautiful
It pulls you out and up
I love the notion of
A body and a soul
You're never truly gone
You're just intangible

[Hook]
And yes, I cry with your last breath
My eyes are compromised
But I refuse to mourn your death
I'll celebrate life
