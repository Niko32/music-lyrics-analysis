And flat on my ass
If you take my photo
I'll show you some class

They call me a pisshead
But what do they know?
There's more love in this head
Than these eyes can show
From fears and fears and laughter and laughter
I feel much better if I've had a drink
Fears from fears and laughter from laughter
I feel much better when I've had a drink

These fingers they touched her
These fingers they learn
These fingers they loved her
These fingers they burn

From fears and fears and laughter and laughter
I feel much better if I've had a drink
Fears from fears and laughter to laughter
I feel much better when I've had a drink

Talking about it makes me start to think
Thinking about it makes me want to drink
