Everybody repping Jesus throw a fist up, And watch how many demons
In a minute we can twist up, Stomp Satan through the earth when Jesus
Lift up, Lion of Judah looking for Lucifer to rip him up, Dispatching angels
To my side ride for the truth, Drive-byes on hell gates screaming Jesus
Side, Holy Ghost blowing holes in the enemy I chop em down with the
Word blood crush the whole vicinity, Special ops infiltrating demonic
Facilities pray it to the ground ready to go another round, And its a battle
To the death blessed with eternal life crucifying the flesh Keep a lock on
Lucifer like I’m flying a jet, Equipped for the dog fight Satan got a mean
Bark but he can’t bite, He thought he had a lock on my faith, But I swole
Up and broke his face I bet you now he know his place

Snatch this back from Satan, this music belong to US, and Jesus
Invented cruck , so demons are getting rush, get toss up in the shy
As enemies bout to die, I blow a head off a demon, Satan gotta burn in
Fry, toss him back in hell, slam him in a cell, push him off a bridge, burn
His body until pale, man you think you know him, man you think you
Know him, Jesus bout show em, how his cruck is spilling over, caz my
You might also likeBody's growing and the holy spirits flowing, talk and foreign tongue as
My God is steady glowing, he’s crazy man, and I can’t tell why, a lot of
Rage, and I can’t tell a lie, I’m chasing them with a scope, I’m pushing
On evil folks, they hanging on windows, I thought I should let you know
They running on tight ropes, and demons about to quote, that Jesus
Invented cruck!

Jesus invented crunk, Jesus invented crunk, when Jesus be getting
Crunk, demons be getting stomped. I’m pumped ready to punk iniquities
Getting dumped, bible tucked ready to rump Satan so what you want
My praise an instrument of war live by the sword, worship imbedded inside
Of my soul praising the Lord. Caz Satan is gone, victory is in me the
Remedy has been given living inside of repentance I’m strong. Now move
For Christ if he delivered you in the valley, everybody hold you bible up
This is the rally. I tally the score, Satan never winning cause sins blemished
Never seen through Christ blood we made clean. New creations through
Faith we can’t been the same thing, unity in the spirit allowing the same
Dream. Vain lies deceit rebuking what’s mainstream, the main thing is
Praising after we made clean cause
