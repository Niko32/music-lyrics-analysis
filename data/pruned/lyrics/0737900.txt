Know not what the years may hold
As I ponder, hope grows fonder
Precious memories flood my soul

Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold

Precious father, loving mother
Glide across the lonely years
And old home scenes from my childhood
In fond memories appear

Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfold

Precious memories, unseen angel
Sent from somewhere to my soul
How they linger ever near me
As the sacred past unfolds

Precious memories, how they linger
How they ever flood my soul
In the stillness of the midnight
Precious sacred scenes unfoldYou might also like
