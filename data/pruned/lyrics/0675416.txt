Kelly, Kelly, contrary to what many think of you
I can tell that your passion is true
It never ceases to amaze me, it's crazy!
When the fellows and ladies wanna see you move
Tell me, tell me what would you do if I told you
I'd come up to you so cool like a feel good friend
I'm not lookin' for romance but I love to watch your body dance

[Chorus]
If you want love, don't move any further
Don't move any further
Got a surprise, all your looking is over
Any moment I'll show what I can do
Right now's the time I can be who I want to

[Bridge]
(Midnight) I'm hitting the dance floor
Nobody knows me until I say "I am Kelly"
(Midnight) will you be my baby?
I'm gonna transform, 'cause my heart wants to tell

[Verse 2]
Midnight comin' on strong
Time to show the people who you were all along
Transform your style from day to night
You can drop your mask and I'll drop mine
I know you don't know me but you could've told me
About the other inside of you
But now that I know, you know what then?
We can work being more than friendsYou might also like
