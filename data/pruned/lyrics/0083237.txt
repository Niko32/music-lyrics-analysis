[Verse 1]
I feel the night approaching
The moon is calling me
Reluctant eyes have witnessed
The horrors I can be
I felt compelled to warn you
I'm not all that I seem
And though I care about you
The night is calling me

Just promise me you'll run (run)
And don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
Don't look back
And promise me

If I should claim a victim
To devour before the light
I pray that you forgive me
Itâ€™s just my appetite

And if I (And if I) should try (should try)
Try to lure you baby (try to lure you back)
Oh, oh you just try to get as far away as you can (Oooh Aaah)

Don't you run, don't you run
What's your name? Who's your daddy
Is he rich like me (Like me, like me)
Has he taken, the time to show you
All the things you need to live
Tell it to me slowly
I really want to know
Is the time of the season for lovin', lovin'
