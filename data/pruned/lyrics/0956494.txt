Open up the gates of Eden
Bride of the promise, nothing she lacks
No angel guards the gates of Eden
No sword on fire to turn her back

[Verse 1]
She's getting out of Babylon
The bully boys that did her wrong
Say she'll be back before too long
But they will tremble after she's gone

[Chorus]
Open up the gates of Eden
Bride of the promise, nothing she lacks
No angel guards the gates of Eden
No sword on fire to turn her back

[Verse 2]
Dust of her feet on everything
And fallen angels, though curses bring
They shall not see her kind again
'Til dressed in glory she does descend

[Chorus]
Open up the gates of Eden
Bride of the promise, nothing she lacks
No angel guards the gates of Eden
No sword on fire to turn her back
You might also like[Bridge]
Child of promise and child of faith
Her treasure's found in that eternal place
Out there beyond the gates of Eden

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
So open up the gates of Eden
Bride of the promise, nothing she lacks
No angel guards the gates of Eden
No sword on fire to turn her back
No sword on fire to turn her back

[Outro]
Open up the gates of Eden
(So open up the gates of Eden)
Open up the gates of Eden
(So open up the gates of Eden)
Open up the gates of Eden
(So open up the gates of Eden)
