Where I start, you begin

[Verse 1]
Try to measure the depth of the sky
That's what this is like
Picture the peace of the sun and the sand
And that's where I am

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Imagine how it feels to know
I'm never alone

[Chorus]
You're every breath, every thought, every sound
You're the ceiling, you are the ground
You're in my heart, in my eyes, in my dreams
You are always with me

[Verse 2]
I can rest in the warmth of your words
You are not of this earth
You are love, you are serenity
And you stay with me
You are always with me
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Everywhere I am I find
'Cause you are inside

[Chorus]
You're every breath, every thought, every sound
You're the ceiling, you are the ground
You're in my heart, in my eyes, in my dreams
You are always with me

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
In the moon and in the stars
In the light and in the dark
In the water, in the dirt
In the mirror I see you first
In the rain and the wind
Around, within
Where I start you begin

[Pre-Chorus 3]
You're in my heart, in my eyes, in my dreams
You're with me

[Chorus]
You're every breath, every thought, every sound
You're the ceiling, you are the ground
You're in my heart, in my eyes, in my dreams
You are always with me
