Hello, baby, I'll be by to pick you up at eight
Wear that red dress
You know, the one you wore on our first date
Ease into my Chevrolet
We're gonna listen to those oldies play, behind the wheel

[Chorus]
We'll go cruisin'
Cruisin' on Saturday night
We'll be movin'
Groovin' in the radio light
It don't matter where we go
Or, baby, what we do
As long as I'm cruisin'
Cruisin' with you

[Verse 2]
There's the drive-in
The place where you and I shared our first kiss
There in the moonlight
Love was shining on a night like this
Slide on over next to me
We're gonna make some new memories, so hold on tight

[Chorus]
We'll go cruisin'
Cruisin' on Saturday night
We'll be movin'
Groovin' in the radio light
It don't matter where we go
Or, baby, what we do
As long as I'm cruisin'
Cruisin' with you
You might also likeWe'll go cruisin'
Cruisin' on Saturday night
We'll be movin'
Groovin' in the radio light
It don't matter where we go
Or, baby, what we do
As long as I'm cruisin'
Cruisin' with you

[Guitar Interlude]

[Partial Chorus]
Now, it don't matter where we go
Or, baby, what we do
As long as I'm cruisin'
Cruisin' with you
Baby, let's go cruisin'
Cruisin' on Saturday night
We'll be movin'
Groovin' in the radio light
You and I can go cruisin'...
