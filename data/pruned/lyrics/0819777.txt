The trick or treating was a big success
You ate some candy and now you're a mess
Then Mommy says "Okay, that's quite enough
Now it's time to get into the tub!"
(Oh man, do I have to?)

You take your Halloween costume off
Dip your big toe in, is it warm enough?
Look in the water, something bubbles up
Could it be the creature from the tub?

Clammy and slimy, gooey, yucky, grimy
Icky and sticky, hope it doesn't lick me
Wobbly, runny, "Mommy, it's not funny"
Watch out for the creature from the tub!

Maybe it slithered up the open drain
And now it's hiding 'neath my rubber ducky
You say it's nothing, but I hear blub, blub
Watch out for the creature from the tub!
(You okay in there? Yeah, I'm okay!)

It must have tentacles like jellyfish
With one big eye and squishy lips
(Mommy!)
It likes to swirl around, while Mommy scrubs
Watch out for the creature from the tub!
(There's something yucky in here!)

Wobbly, runny, "Mommy, it's not funny"
Watch out for the creature from the tub!

(Oh my!)
Now in these wet and murky suds I float
Not sure I'm happy here at all, oh no
Yikes, it's attached itself to Mommy's hands
Then I hear her say, "I found the soap!"

Clammy and slimy, gooey, yucky, grimy
Icky and sticky, hope it doesn't lick me
Wobbly, runny, "Mommy, it's not funny"
Watch out for the creature from the tub!
