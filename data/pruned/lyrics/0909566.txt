I entered the room
Sat by your bed all through the night
I watched your daily fight
I hardly knew
The pain
Was almost more than I could bear
And still I hear
Your last words to me

[Chorus]
Heaven is a place nearby
So I won't be so far away
And if you try and look for me
Maybe you'll find me someday
Heaven is a place nearby
So there's no need to say goodbye
I wanna ask you not to cry
I'll always be by your side

[Verse 2]
You just faded away
You spread your wings, you had flown
Away to something unknown
Wish I could bring you back
You're always on my mind
About to tear myself apart
You have your special place in my heart
Always
You might also like[Chorus]
Heaven is a place nearby
So I won't be so far away
And if you try and look for me
Maybe you'll find me someday
Heaven is a place nearby
So there's no need to say goodbye
I wanna ask you not to cry
I'll always be by your side

[Bridge]
And even when I go to sleep
I still can hear your voice
And those words
I never will forget

[Chorus]
Heaven is a place nearby
So I won't be so far away
And if you try and look for me
Maybe you'll find me someday
Heaven is a place nearby
So there's no need to say goodbye
I wanna ask you not to cry
I'll always be by your side
