Splashing
Making a mess of myself
Splashing
Making a mess of my health

[Verse 1]
When I go out to a club
I check my mind at the door
With a porter in a paper bag
Pick it up when I leave at four

[Pre-Chorus]
Soaking up the night with my eyes
Saucers of burnin' oil
Soaking up things through my paper skin
My blood is starting to boil

[Chorus]
Splashing
Making a mess of myself
Splashing
Making a mess of my health

[Verse 2]
When I go out of my head
The lights go on in the sky
Now, I just want to crawl in bed
I couldn't get up if I tried
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Soaking up the night with my eyes
Saucers of burnin' oil
I'm soaking up things through my paper skin
And my blood is starting to boil

[Chorus, condensed]
Splashing

[Bridge]
When I'm as big as my uncle Jim
I'll give you all cause to complain
Walkin' around with boots on my head
Like a missile on a train

[Chorus]
Splashing
Making a mess of myself
Splashing
Making a mess of my health

[Pre-Chorus]
Soaking up the night with my eyes
Saucers of burnin' oil
Soaking up things through my paper skin
And my blood is starting to boil
[Chorus]
Splashing
Making a mess of myself
Splashing
Making a mess of my health

[Outro]
Splashing
I'm still splashing
Splashing
I'm still splashing
Splashing
Splashing
Splashing
Splashing
