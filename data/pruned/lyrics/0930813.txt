And form a noose around my neck
And I know just how to break them

All these words, they fall
And form a noose around my neck
But I keep choking, choking on regret

Someone do me a favour, please
Make some room for me to breathe
On your way out, burst my heart

Come back here
Take my breath away
You know I only ever felt this way with you

My dreams keep me from waking
I keep wishing there was somewhere in-between where we could meet
But I'm afraid to fall asleep
Come back here
Take my breath away
You know I only ever felt this way with you
Open my eyes, without control
I'm fighting, I'm losing hope

You're walking away
You might also likeSo go back to the arms you thought were safe
And I'll find an excuse, I'll find an excuse
But each time I get
Closer and closer

And I'm out of time
So I'll leave you this way
And I can explain
But it's not okay

Come back here
Take my breath away
You know I only ever felt this way with you
Open my eyes, without control
I'm fighting, I'm losing hope

And I can explain
But it's not okay
