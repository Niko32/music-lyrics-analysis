Out for my body in such lose feeling
I blame these sad things on me

Cut a smile in my face so you'll intake some fleeting comfort

Close in
I won't let you out of my touch
But you brandish the weapon of passive aggression

It seems like your idea I'm perfect
In mine I'm perfectly in line
So let's be enemies
To see the sun go away

Would you think I'd let you in
I've grown to suffer you lashing out at me
To see the sun go away

Don't deny my tolerance
Don't take away these sad things from me
And that ain't nothing
You should see what I'd do to me

Cut a smile in my face so you'll intake some fleeting comfort
You've built a wall of beauty to help tolerate any discomfort

Your idea that I'm perfect
In mine I'm perfectly in line
So let's be enemies
To see the sun go away

Would you think I'd let you in
I've grown to suffer you lashing out at me
I will stand alone

Your idea, I'm perfect
In mine I'm perfectly in line
So let's be enemies
To see the sun go away

My idea, unless you're blind is
How did you fall away
