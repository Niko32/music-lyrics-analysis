I was born, I was blessed
Right place, right time, I guess
Ain't no good reason why I left
Except to run and roam
Would you take me back and take me in?
Let me be your child again
Kiss my cheek, forgive my sins
And let me call you home
Oh, I may stay here for a while

[Chorus]
If I'm gonna fly, I'm gonna fly down South
I'm gonna drive, I'm gonna find a small town
South is where my momma lives
Where my little piece of heaven is
If I'm gonna dream, I'm gonna dream your face
If I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go to that place
And figure out what I lost and found
Down South

[Verse 2]
Religion and me don't always agree, but I sure love my maker
Sounds just like a gospel song when I sing my little prayer
Got rocks in my shoes, holes in my soul
I'm covered in dirt from head to toe
From walking along this winding road that brought me back to here
Oh, I may stay here for a while
You might also like[Chorus]
If I'm gonna fly, I'm gonna fly down South
I'm gonna drive, I'm gonna find a small town
South is where my momma lives
Where my little piece of heaven is
If I'm gonna dream, I'm gonna dream your face
If I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go to that place
And figure out what I lost and found
Down South

[Interlude]
Ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh, na-na-na
Oh, I may stay here for a while

[Chorus]
If I'm gonna fly, I'm gonna fly down South
I'm gonna drive, I'm gonna find a small town
South is where my momma lives
Where my little piece of heaven is
If I'm gonna dream, I'm gonna dream your face
If I'm gonna go, I'm gonna go to that place
And figure out what I lost and found
Down South
Down South
[Interlude]
Ooh, na-na-na-na-na-na
Ooh, na-na-na

[Bridge]
Down South, born and raised
Down South, where I learned to pray
Down South, is where I'll stay
Down South
Down South, born and raised
Down South, where I learned to pray
Down South, is where I'll stay
Down South

[Outro]
Rocks in my shoes, holes in my soul
I'm covered in dirt from head to toe
