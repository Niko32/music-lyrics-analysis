All this time barely just getting by
I would crawl even though I could fly high
Mr. Play-it-safe, I was too afraid to fail
Just waiting to exhale, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
It’s like I lost my way but I found it again
After someone said, “Let there be light”
And now I’m in this place with the wind on my face
And I know for the first time

[Chorus]
I’m ali-li-li-li, alive (x4)

[Verse 2]
I didn’t know all the things I was missing
All I had to do was stop and listen
Beauty surrounds you, but it’s nowhere to be found
If you’re only looking down

[Pre-Chorus & Chorus]

[Bridge]
And now I’m seeing colors I’ve never seen before
I’m living in this moment, oh, forget tomorrow
It’s all about right now, standing here with you
Let’s run, let’s run
You might also like[Chorus]
’Cause I’m ali-li-li-li, alive
I’m ali-li-li-li, alive
