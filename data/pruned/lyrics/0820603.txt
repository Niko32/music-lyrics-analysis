It's Christmas time again
Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing
It's Christmas time again
Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing

[Verse 1]
It's kinda cold outside
But it's alright 'cause it's Christmas time
So let the snow begin
To decorate the city, Christmas time is oh so pretty
I love...

[Chorus]
It's Christmas time again
Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing
It's Christmas time again
Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing

[Verse 2]
The house is filled with cheer
'Cause we're all here, trying to guess what things we got this year
The kids can't wait to see
If Santa left a shiny box underneath the christmas tree

[Chorus]
It's Christmas time again
Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing
It's Christmas time again
Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing
It's Christmas time again
Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing
It's Christmas time again
Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing

I remember the first time I made Christmas cookies at Aunt Mimi's
Me and my cousin Shock stayed up all night to put the icing on
And then everybody came over 'cause Mimi cooked and baked pies
And all my mom and dad brought was two gallons of ice cream
That's what I remember about Christmas

[Chorus]
It's Christmas time again
Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing
It's Christmas time again
Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing
It's Christmas time again
Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing
It's Christmas time again
Can't wait to hear those sleigh bells ringing
