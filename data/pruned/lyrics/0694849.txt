I stopped in the church to pray
It was the middle of the day
And I don't even know if I believe in God But I laid my soul on the table
And left that place believing I was able to pull back the curtain my old fears had drawn
I was out on the fourth of July when I saw those kids I just had to cry
The whole town was blazing in the summers heat
But out in front of a row of run down shacks they had that fire hydrant uncapped
Baptizing their bodies right there in the street
There's a tree outside my window It sings when wind blows
I have got water and fire I know sorrow I feel desire
And could it be that the kingdom has already come
We all see good and bad in everything that we have
But life is waiting just behind that veil if this will be loved and that will be hated
The soul is left to struggle segregated
Trapped in the harbor too weighted down to sail
There's a tree outside my window It sings when wind blows
I've got water and fire I know sorrow I feel desire
And could it be that the kingdom has already come
We all see good and bad in everything that we haveYou might also like
