There's a road a winding road that never ends
Full of curves lessons learned at every bend
Going's rough unlike the straight and narrow
It's for those who go against the grain
Have no fear dare to dream of a change
Live to march to the beat of a different drummer
And it all might come together
And it all might unraveled
On the road less traveled

[Chorus]
For the road less traveled ain't for the faint of heart
For those who choose to play it safe and never stray too far
Me I want to live my life and one day leave my mark
And it all might come together
And it all come unraveled
On the road less traveled

[Verse 2]
I've chosen a pathway I may not endure
One thing's for certain nothing's for sure
And it all might come together
And it all might come unraveled
On the road less traveled
You might also like[Chorus]

[outro]
There's a road winding road that never ends
