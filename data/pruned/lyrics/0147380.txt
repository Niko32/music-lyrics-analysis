All that he wants is a radical life, to live up to
Past great minds and a forward thinking creed
It’s not enough to be the boy that everyone loves
He's lost in the gray that he never used to see

[Verse 2]
Stealing the heat of the music made in the foundry
Laced with the verse at the meadowed edge of the sea
Here are words that I’m sure that I've misspoken
But now ain't a time that it matters that much to me

[Chorus]
And you might feel like
Now there's nothing left for you
But I've heard that one before
What's new

[Verse 3]
And what we never feel we see in skin
That all the breaking up's just breaking in
But I could do much worse than being my dad
And If I'm blessed with this I'll face it that

[Bridge]
These are the years we'll be desperate to hold onto
Haven't we learned that from every book we read
You might also like[Chorus]
