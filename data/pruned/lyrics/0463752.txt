Raindrops keep falling on my head
Just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed
Nothing seems to fit
Oh, raindrops keep falling on my head

Keep a-falling
'Cause I just done me some talking to the sun
And I said I didn't like the way he got things done
Sleeping on the job

Oh, raindrops keep falling on my head
Keep a-falling
But there's one thing I know
The blues they send to meet me

Won't defeat me
It won't be long till happiness
Comes up to greet me
To greet greet greet greet me

Raindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
'Cause I ain't gonna stop the rain by complaining
You might also likeRaindrops keep falling on my head
But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turning red
Crying's not for me
Cause I ain't gonna stop the rain by complaining

[Outro]
Because I'm free
Nothing's bothering me
Because I'm free
Nothing's bothering me
Because I'm free
Nothing's bothering me
Because I'm free
Nothing's bothering me
