In the chilly hours and minutes
Of uncertainty I want to be
In the warm hold of your loving mind
To feel you all around me
And to take your hand along the sand
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

[Verse 2]
When sundown pales the sky
I want to hide a while behind your smile
And everywhere I'd look, your eyes I'd find
For me to love you now
Would be the sweetest thing, t'would make me sing
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

[Bridge]
Dee-dee, dee-dee, dee-dee-dee-dee
Dee-dee-dee-dee, dee-dee-dee-dee
Dee, dee-dee

[Verse 3]
When rain has hung the leaves with tears
I want you near to kill my fears
To help me to leave all my blues behind
For standing in your heart
Is where I want to be and I long to be
Ah, but I may as well try and catch the wind

[Outro]
