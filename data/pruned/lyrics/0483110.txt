Until the day is done
I'll look to find you
When all the pain is gone
I will be another
I'll put out my hand
I know you'll look to find it
I know you'll understand
(Chorus)
I know its a time to be defined
You would give your life to be desired
I don't want my time to be decided
I can see a lifetime in your eyes
It gave me what I needed
You showed me what I had
Too much to leave alone
Too much to be unsaid
All of the words are gone
All of the time is spent
Nothing to be forgiven
I know you'll understand

(Chorus)x1
You might also like(Bridge)
Underneath the time
Underneath the light
I'll be under you
I'll be underneath the light

(Chorus)x1

You would give your life to be desired
This could be a life you'll never find
You could always leave it all behind
This could be a life you'll never find
You could always leave it all behind
This could be a life you'll never find
This could be a life you'll never find
