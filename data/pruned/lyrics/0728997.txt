Temporary mood swings
Throwing tantrums is my best gift
Now let me show you my best fits
It's my best fits
It's my best fits
It's my best fits, it's mine

[Verse 2]
Temporary mood swings
Praying a prayer so I don't get old
Smiling a smile that I can't control
And I can't control, I can't control
I can't control much more

[Verse 3]
Temporary mood swings
Now let me show you my expertise
I will perform just a little tease
I scream I shout
Oh way too loud
I laugh I dance
I pee my pants
I scream I shout, way too loud
I laugh I dance in such a trance
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh temporary mood swings
I am a victim of my own desire
In hope that you like me better
I want to be good
I want to be good
I want to be good
Til you like me better
I want to be good
I want to be good
I want to be good
Til you like me better

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, it's only temporary
Oh temporary
Oh, it's only temporary
Oh temporary

[Verse 4]
Temporary people
Soon there will be nothing to remember
So let your heart grow oh so tender
And be my best gift be my best gift
Be my best gift be mine
[Verse 5]
Unconventional temperament
I am an antisocial mess
And I suffer from heavy stress
I'm antisocial, antisocial
Antisocial and I want to be good

[Chorus]
Oh temporary mood swings
I am a victim of my own desire
In hope that you like me better
I want to be good
I want to be good
I want to be good
Til you like me better
I want to be good
I want to be good
I want to be good
Til you like me better

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, it's only temporary
Oh temporary
Oh, it's only temporary
Oh temporary
