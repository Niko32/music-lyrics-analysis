He's well dressed, bats are fying 'round
He's got a charming smile, he's got a hypnotic glance, he's got on to you
He's got you in a trance

Watch out when you get on the Transsylvian Express

He's got a charming smile, he's got a hypnotic glance, he's got on to you
He's got you in a trance
Find yourself in terror staring at your throat
And the train to where your blood will flow

Watch out when you get on the Transsylvian Express

Find yourself in terror staring at your throat
And the train to where your blood will flow
He's got you into his castle drinking blood red wine, when he takes you in
His arms his teeth sink in you veins
