Booty call, just a booty call (Come on)
Ain't nothin' in the world like a booty call (Yeah)
Booty call, just a booty call (Come on)

[Verse 1: Teddy Riley]
Hey baby, turn around
It's not what it seems
The way I like it by the pound
Must be in the genes
Only wanna have fun
No time to get sprung
That's the way it is on Blackstreet
After all, it's a booty call

[Pre-Chorus: Teddy Riley & (Girl)]
(Booty call)
Girl, you know what I like
You've got it (Booty call)
Just be there tonight
I want it (Booty call) (Hey, yeah)
You know that it's right
All I wanna do is be where you're at
Why must I feel like that?
You might also like[Chorus: Blackstreet, Teddy Riley, Dave Hollister]
Why must I feel like that? Why must I chase the cat?
Nothin' but the dog in me
(Nothin' but the dog in me)
(Nothin' but the dog)
Why must I feel like that? Why must I chase the cat?
Ain't nothin' but the dog in me
(Check it) (Yeah)

[Verse 2: Teddy Riley & Dave Hollister]
Sometimes I feel that I might wanna settle down
But on my wedding night I feel I'm gonna play around
Life is too short to lie (Hey)
I mean no disrespect at all (No)
But if the other woman's on my mind
On the hotline, it's a booty call

[Pre-Chorus: Teddy Riley]
You know what I like
You've got it
Just be there tonight
I want it
You know that it's right
All I wanna do is be where you're at
Why must I feel like that?
[Chorus: Blackstreet, Teddy Riley, Dave Hollister]
Why must I feel like that? Why must I chase the cat?
Ain't nothin' but the dog in me
(Nothin' but the dog in me, nothin' but the dog)
Why must I feel like that? Why must I chase the cat?
Ain't nothin' but the dog in me
Bow wow wow yippee yo yippee yay, hey
Yo 'Twan, take it to the bridge

[Verse 3: Antwone Dickey]
Now, every dog has his day and I'm diggin' on the vibes
So we can get together, make tonight real live
Checkin' out the front, checkin' out the back
Well, I'll be goddamned, is it really like that?
Summer's hot, winter's freezin'
Chasin' that cat all through the season
Ayo, girl, stop teasin'
Cut the jokes 'cause I really wanna stroke
You're sayin' I'll drown, I'm sayin' you'll choke
Back at my place, face to face
I'm tryna be real so we can cut to the chase
You know what I like, and baby, you got it
Come on, let's get this started
Back on Blackstreet, we can have a ball
'Cause after all, girl, it's just a booty call
[Pre-Chorus: Teddy Riley & (Girl)]
