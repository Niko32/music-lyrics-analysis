You’ve given me the taste, of my most wildest dreams When it got dark
You showed me where to go
You stayed awake all night
And made sure I’d be just fine
You fed me food, cigarettes and booze
And when I thought that that was it
You’d share my deepest darkest wish
I know I know
Those moments that we shared
Were much more than a few
But now I have to leave you dear…
Goodbye Berlin
We laughed and cried and sang all night and partied hard so many times I knew, you were the one
Your sexy mess, creative ways, freaky fun and crazy games
You know… you are the best!
You picked me up and threw me down and dragged me out all through the town Berlin …you wicked thing!
I cherish all everything you gave -it’s part of me
Goodbye Berlin
I’m gonna miss you so much
Them moments that we shared were way more than enough I can’t ever, ever be with someone else
The love you gave me was the most I ever felt before
But I gotta go, yes I gotta go before I’m lost
Lost in all them sweet desires I ever dreamed to touch
And I’m all messed up -So wrecked from all your fun
Your twisted ways of pushing me and pulling me are done Goodbye Berlin
I’m so in love, this cannot be so right
I go so far away and miss you every night I cannot live without you
I cannot live within you
This cities love… Ahhh!
