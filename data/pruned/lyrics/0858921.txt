I told you I don't want to but you don't let me say no
I drop a wire to your mom and your dad and say
"Relax, don't think about the way I treat you." Huh

Shake humble hands with a far away neighbor
Take part in something you can sure understand
You're now allergic to the rumble and noise
So relax, don't think about the way I treat you, uh huh

Well I've got the time
And I found a way
And I really want you
And you really want to

Sent from St. Louis with a bomb in his brain
He drove his brand new sports car on a national campaign
He's not affected by the rallies and wars and says
"Relax, don't think about the way I treat you. Believe me"

You learn to walk at a comfortable slumber
Pursuing numbly toward sure history
You don't remember and it's not important
So relax, don't think about the way I treat you, yeah

Well, I've got the time
And I found a way
And I really want you
And you really want to

Relax, don't think about the way I treat you (and you really want to)
