She's in the back room counting stock
And down in a warehouse out by the dock
Jesse's lifting crates and breaking rock
But when the whistle blows to end the daily fight
And the working forces turn out the light
Jesse takes that little girl and he holds her tight
As the day fades away he says
We're all that matters tonight

Tonight's the night, I know I'm right
And heart to heart, we'll make it Tonight
So hold me tight, and love me right
The world can wait for tomorrow Tonight

Patty comes like an angel and takes his hand
Jesse says, "Baby, I've got a plan"
He says, "I wanna get married and make a stand
But there's just one thing you gotta understand
Now the pressure of living and the daily fight
Could hurt us in time if our perspective ain't right
So shut the door and put out the light
And baby, be here, because we're all that matters Tonight "

Tonight's the night, I know I'm right
And heart to heart, we'll make it Tonight
So hold me tight, and love me right
The world can wait for tomorrow Tonight

Sweating blood just to stay alive
Running home to the harbor light

Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight
Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight, Tonight

Tonight's the night, I know I'm right
And heart to heart, we'll make it Tonight
So hold me tight, and love me right
The world can wait for tomorrow Tonight

Tonight's the night, I know I'm right
And heart to heart, we'll make it t Tonight
So hold me tight, and love me right
The world can wait for tomorrow Tonight
