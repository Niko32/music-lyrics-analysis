Do such strange things to me
The way you dress gets people talkin'
Cuz' it's the things that they see

Silk stockings and romantic lace
Can set a man's soul on fire
No other lady looks as good as you
You wear a woman's attire

Something happens when you start your show
You get that look in your eye

Take it off, take it off
Take it off-cuz' I like it

You try and tease with an overcoat
And a smile your face
Slip into something more comfortable
Oh girl you're makin' me wait

I get crazy when the lights are low
And my passion is highYou might also like
