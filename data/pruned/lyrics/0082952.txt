She said, "Hold your breath so you don't come
Away from me too soon."
Then I forgot what I was going to get
To tell you

[Hook]
When the summer breeze blew in that day
Changes white to gray
I laid with you and felt your body reach its peak
Did I hear you say
"Come harder, baby, so I can feel your waist vibrate"?
When white turns to gray
I lay with you
White turns to gray
I lay with you
I lay with you

[Verse 2]
You know I've stayed away too long
Did you miss me?
Looks like your heartbeat is rushing-
Sick of rushing, but woah it's still good
I feel you all over me
Can you feel me, too?
