You make me happy with the things you do
Oh, can it be so?
This feeling follows me wherever I go

I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why
'Cause you, you make lovin' fun
(It's all I wanna do)
'Cause you, you make lovin' fun

Don't, don't break the spell

It would be different and you that it will
'Cause you, you make lovin' fun
And I don't have to tell you, that you're the only one

I never did believe in miracles
But I've a feeling it's time to try
I never did believe in the ways of magic
But I'm beginning to wonder why

'Cause you, you make loving fun
(It's all I wanna do)
You, you make loving funYou might also like
