But I guess id tell you thru hear cause you never show
Who would wanna hear this shit going thru my head
When you could of been here in stead
It was pretty messed up that you led me on
You don't realize how sad I was when you were gone
We used to be the best of friends
But now, it all ends
I guess it didn't turn well I suppose
Which you know, kinda blows
It all ends sooner or later
I guess I shoulda prepared my self a lil better
I ain't trying to say that you are a hater
This is something I wouldn't want to chose later
Why'd you chose this
We coulda been just friends
But I guess you decided it was gunna end
We both been bitches to eachother, here and there
But I never thought you'd actually couldn't bare
Bare with all this shit we've been thru
But I guess you just left me out in the blueYou might also like
