For liquorice drops and jelly roll
Hey sugar daddy
Hansel needs some sugar in his bowl
I'll lay out fine china on the linen
And polish up the chrome
And if you've got some sugar for me
Sugar Daddy, bring it home

Black strap molasses
You're my orange-blossom honey bear
Bring me Versace blue jeans
And black designer underwear
We'll dress up like the disco-dancing
Jet set in Milan and Rome
And if you've got some sugar for me
Sugar Daddy, bring it home

Oh the thrill of control
Like the rush of rock and roll
Is the sweetest taste I've known, oh yeah
So come on, Sugar Daddy, bring it home

When honey bees go shopping
It's something to be seen
They swarm to wild flowers
And get nectar for the queen
And everything you bring me
Got me dripping like a honeycomb
And if you've got some sugar for me
Sugar Daddy, bring it home
You might also likeOh the thrill of control
Like the Blitzkrieg on the roll
Is the sweetest taste I've know, oh yeah
If you've got some sugar
Bring it home, bah-bah-dabba-dabba-dabba-do
Come on, Sugar Daddy, bring it home!

Whiskey and French cigarettes
A motorbike with high-speed jets
A Waterpik, a Cuisinart
And a hypo-allergenic dog
I want all the luxuries of the modern age
And every item on every page
In the Lillian Vernon catalogue

So you think only a woman
Can truly love a man?
Well, you buy me the dress
I'll be more woman
Than a man like you can stand
I'll be your Venus on a chocolate clam shell
Rising on a sea of marshmallow foam
And if you got some sugar for me
Sugar Daddy, bring it home

It's our tradition to control
Like Erich Honecker and Helmut Kohl
Remember him
From the Ukraine to the Rhone
Sweet home Ã¼ber alles
Lord, I'm coming home, yeah
Come on, Sugar Daddy, bring me home
