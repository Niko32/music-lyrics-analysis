Once she lay open like a road
Carved apart the madness that I stumbled from
But she fell away
She fell away
Shed me like a skin
She fell away
Left me holding everything

[Bridge]
Seems impossible to me now
Seems impossible to me now
Seems impossible to me now

[Verse 2]
But once the road lay open like a girl
And we drank and laughed and threw the bottle over
But she fell away
She fell away
I did not see the cracks form
As I knelt to pray
I did not see the crevice yawn, no, no, no

[Verse 3]
Sometimes
At night I feel the end it is at hand
My pistol going crazy in my hand
For she fell away
O she fell away
Walked me to the brink
Then fell away
I did not see her fall
To better days
Sometimes I wonder was she ever really there at all
Yes, she fell away
She fell away
Oh she fell away
Oh she fell awayYou might also like
