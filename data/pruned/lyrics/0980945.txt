No matter what I do it leaves you all undone
Hey baby no need to go crazy
Over some little something I've said
Can't you see you're the keeper of my heart
Even when I lose my head, yes

We've still got it good no matter how bad it gets
Even after all this time the slipper still fits
Hey, just look at how far we've come by choosing to stay
Baby, don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin' away

Sometimes the whisper of love gets lost in the angry shout
Even hearts that are in this deep
Might think about an easy way out
One honest touch makes those worries
Just fade like stars at dawn
These occasional moments of weakness
Only makes our love more strong, oh

We've still got it good no matter how bad it gets
Even after all this time the slipper still fits
Hey, just look at how far we've come by choosing to stay
Baby, don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin' away

It gets easier all the time
Oh, and harder and harder to leave behind
You might also likeWe've still got it good no matter how bad it gets
Even after all this time the slipper still fits
Hey, just look at how far we've come by choosing to stay
Baby, don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin' away

Baby, don't go there love don't get nowhere walkin' away..
