One time, for your mind. Let's get it going
Phonte, Big Pooh, Little Brother, that's how we gonna do, one time, check it
Pure purpose put it down tonight and ah, Rick Skits gonna put it down tonight
From NC to Stockholm. Back on the couch is my nigga Big Dho
Drop the beat cause he be po'

[Verse One] [Phonte]
I keep tellin' my label
It ain't a sprint, it's a marathon homie
You ain't gotta verify to tell if I'm phony
The state of rap is garbage
Phonte's flow is so retarded
Jerry Lewis throws telethons for me
I'm only eight bars from my conclusion and
I'mma slow it down so I don't lose you niggas
Cause with or without a record deal
My wreckin' skills will turn your Pleasantville to Fallujah nigga
Up Hygh
Hit me with a beat from that funk box
This kid is bonkers
His flow is on lunch box
Cause y'all niggas must have forgot
Little Brother, motherfucker, keep it bubblin' hot
Now turn me up

We just flow
Through your soul
We take you back to the days of Africa
We just flow
Lose control
Keep on, keep on and on

[Verse Two] [Big Pooh]
In the past four years
I grew a couple more and I shed a few tears
Drank a few beers
Smoked with my peers
Let the habit die
Just to bring it right back before I put it to the side
Rocked a few shows
Fucked a few hoes
Spent a lot of money on shoes and clothes
Did I need them A-1's? Probably not I suppose
But when niggas get doe, you know how it goes
Had an album in the stores (Really?)
Well, not many
But next time round guarantee there'll be plenty and
This is the skinny
One, that big boy
Put your hands in the air, make some motherfuckin' noise
[Hook] [Up Hygh]
We just flow
Through your soul
We take you back to the days of Africa
We just flow
Lose control
Keep on, keep on and on
