Motherfuckers wanna run they mouth, like I don't know what the fuck they bout
Nigga your shits weak, and your a pip squeak six feet deep in the motherfucking ground, ugh
XZaR nigga I am the aire to this Hip Hop shit, bitch pop quiz
Who else in the field has the best chance to make it and become famous?
Me nigga! not you! if you still in the field then you still in the field
That means you ain't making moves, nigga I did what I came to do
Shit on you and your nameless crew, Take Over Muzik is the team
There's nobody else that touching us, huh, what the fuck is up?

[Hook: x2]
You niggas try me not, my temper might be hot
You fucking do it and I'll check you like a Nike shop
I'm out my fucking mind, I got nothing but time
You niggas gonna need protection from something divine

[Verse 2]
I've been ignored for way too long, everybody knows I'm the best kept secret
A star was still born, you niggas could even dead the fetus
You lucky you even get to see it, bow down when I walk in the room
Feeling like an arch villain when I'm chilling cause I really walk with the goons
Bang! they just might target a few, if you niggas really trying step to me
Never been the one to grab the tech and squeeze, but if you don't want war I suggest you leave
Simple as that, bend your bitch over and hit from the back
Hit it so good that when I'm done she gon ink my name on her chest, call it tit for the tat

[Verse 3]
Heard from a little bird, ya think that I'm full of myself, you fucking right
I'm a Jordan groupie, I crush the mic and your insecure so you just uptight
I don't give a fuck if I'm on your remix, I drop verses like reverends preaching
On Easter Sunday, trust me I done it all, so I don't give a fuck how I come across
Yeah I'm so sick with it, and I'm all the rave like a glow stick with it
The most explicit, that's so exquisite, with he flows don't limit he's roasting critics
Damn.. In a month from now I'll begun my reign
X-Z lower case A-R nigga, remember my fucking name

[Hook]
