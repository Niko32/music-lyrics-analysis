I was doing alright
Laying in and laying low
I was wasting my night
Calling in my favorite songs on the local radio

[Verse 2]
I was standing in the window
Staring down into the street
Just when the lightning flashed and the thunder rolled
And the telephone rang

[Chorus 1]
I'm waiting for a Christchurch woman in the rain
Yeah, the rain keep comin', but it ain't enough to cover the pain

[Verse 3]
Now I've always been a fool
For a conversation and a couple of smokes
Yeah, and when I'm feeling this blue
I just need someone to laugh at my jokes

[Chorus 2]
I'm waiting for a Christchurch woman in the rain
And it's early evening, so there's hope for a better day
You might also like[Bridge]
Now I know it's gettin' late
It's Friday night and the crowds are startin' to fade away
I know I shouldn't be here waitin' on her
But I keep thinking any second she'll be comin' 'round the corner
And I should be in my room
Man, I should learn how to forget
Well, she may be pretty but someday I'll get sick of her shit

[Chorus 3]
I'm waiting for a Christchurch woman in the rain
Rain keep comin' but it ain't enough to cover the pain
I'm waiting for a Christchurch woman in the rain
And it's early evening so there's hope for a better day
