I am ready
Oh, my children
When Jesus knocks at my door
I'll be there come morning
Don't weep for me
I'll be with my Lord

[Verse 2]
There's my Bible on the table
Read it to me once more
I can hear God's heavenly angels
Singing me on through heaven's door

[Verse 3]
Hallelujah, Lord
I am ready
No more sorrow
Hallelujah, yes
I am ready, I am ready
I am ready to go

[Verse 4]
Oh, Hosanna
Take my hand now
Lead me to the promised land now
I am ready, I am ready
Hallelujah, I am ready to go
Oh, Hosanna
I am ready to go

I can hear God's heavenly angels
Singing me on through heaven's door
Singing me on through heaven's door
And I am ready
