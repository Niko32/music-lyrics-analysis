Why are you never there for me
It's like I'm a ghost and you're scared of me

[Kanden]
Chilling out at sea, with a bad bitch
Hawaiian tees, with the green tea, smoking cabbage
Pina coladas, full package
Rolling blunts, pouring cups you know I got the magic
Popped a pill, chilled, now I'm ecstatic
Everything I make is a damn instant classic
Puff puff, and pass it
Bought a zip made of platic
Bodies in the wrap, now skip the havoc
Dressed in many fabrics
Got all these haters mad
Smoking in bahamas, skip the drama, always dressed in pajamasYou might also like
