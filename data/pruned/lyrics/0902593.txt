A bit of drama, on a lovely day
It's a simple thing, of confidence
No understanding or identity

You should be more like your teacher
More like your father, more like the pastor
More like God and more like me

I'm dragging loneliness. I have no use for friends
I don't see myself, that heavy
Kneel by my bed at night. I feel the family
When I have the lights out, I have the darkness I need

My sympathetic eyes, look down the sights
I find significance in the target
Look deep inside, hopelessness crashing on me
This act of desperation explodes

You should be more like your father
More like a son, more like a giver
Less like a taker and not such a liver
More like a teacher, not like a dreamer
More like God, more like me
And more like your mother
More like the sun, more like the father
More like God, more like the teacherYou might also like
