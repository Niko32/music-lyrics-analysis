Raised in the elven home
He wears the ring of Boramir
The future holds his throne
Because of love he cannot have
He walks the world alone
The lady of Lothlorien
Whose eyes in wisdom shone
The horn of Boramir is calling still
From the falls of Rauros to Gondor
Noble was his death
Against the evil ones
Raised inside the heart of Mordor
Ranger of Eriador hidden heir of kings
With dwarves and elves and halflings
They fight the war of rings
Because of love he cannot have
He walks the world alone
The lady of Lothlorien
Whose eyes in wisdom shone
And now we tread the many paths of death
Seeking the betrayers of our kin
Aragorn leads spirits of grey company's
To the slaving corsair ships at sea
He must be the king he wears the elfstone
In the fields of Pelennor you can hear the sound
Many were the fallen
Well met they hit the ground
In the mighty battle where
Lives were won and lost
On the way Mordor Mordor
Gondor He must be the King
He wears the elfstone
He is the heir of Isildur
Raised in the elven home
He wears the ring of Boramir
The future holds his throne
Because of love he cannot have
He walks the world alone
The lady of Lothlorien
Whose eyes in wisdom shone
He wears the elfstone
He wears the elfstone
He wears the elfstone
Ooooow he must be the KingYou might also like
