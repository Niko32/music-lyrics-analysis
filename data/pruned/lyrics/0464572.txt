Succinctly, success ain't such a sad concept
Taking the lead, I plug in and power past
Head start this bitch blows amazing
It's got me willin' out so damn crazy
My big cannon
My new figure, I figure would be sorta like Atilla
Suddenly and rapidly getting bigger
I play it straight so it's a date yo
Like escrow
I'm the future
You're carbonated acid I dilute ya
Scoop ya and swoop down and shoot ya
Play your chick like I'm riddling a riddle
And my Dick's like Malcolm, it's in the middle

[Bridge]
I'm ahead of the race
I Dictate the pace
Cause I'm Saving face
But I'm moving too fast for you to contemplate
So let's just slow down
No relapse
Already past you
Alright I'll stop that

Call me Rick Flair
Cause I'm old school
And I come strong With a bold plan or two
You see me running

Like a porn star with an attitude
I'm head strong and so fast
When the beat stops I leave you in the past

A murder mystery
A Crude romance
Stacking the big bills
We Leaving no change
We Presbyterian
In the limelight
Like legionaries

This success driving me crazy
This bitch Is Gonna duke daisy
This lesbian doing a pole dance
Gripping tightly
With the leather pants
So freaky
She crazy
We dirty dancing
Call me swayze

Go behind you
Blind-siding
Leaving no chance
So Where you hiding?
[Verse 4]
Oh My second chance
My heart surgery
Slows down my plans
Creating urgency
Transparency yeah you see-through

Like Nas or a Jigga with an attitude
Wesley Sniping a bitch we stole shows
Tax evasion
The problems solved
I've got it figured out
I'm on the roll
Like like LeBron James
I'm bold
I'm so cold
You so sold
Stalling on my ass
You just froze
