Down along the Dixie Line
Banjos are strumming
Horseflies are humming
Ripe melons on the vine
The gold and the gray
They say look away
Way down along the Dixie Line

Back in my childhood I walk the wildwood
Down along the Dixie Line
The freight trains are squalling
Eyeballs are bawling
Four engines at a time
Well I was so happy with Momma and Pappy
Down along the Dixie Line

Can't you hear them drivers wail?
Can't you see them bright rails shine?
I want to catch that Fireball Mail
Leaving Northland far behind

Rivers of whiskey flow down to Dixie
Down along the Dixie Line
But they pulled up the tracks now
And I can't go back now
Can't hardly keep from cryin'
Oh do they miss me way down in Dixie
Down along the Dixie Line

Can't you see them bright rails shine?
I want to catch that Fireball Mail
Leaving Northland far behind

Can't you hear them drivers wail?
Can't you see them bright rails shine?
I want to catch that Fireball Mail
Leaving Northland far behind
I want to catch that Fireball Mail
Leaving Northland far behind
