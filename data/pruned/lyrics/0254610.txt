A side of temperance
An appetite for excess
I'm burning out like your cigarette

[Verse 1]
You (You had me cornered)
You had me at goodbye
(I lived to watch you)
I loved to see you slip away
(I enjoyed captivity)
Staring at a car crash

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We kill at weddings and live for funerals
We're taking steps on the water just to show
We do whatever we want to

[Chorus]
Did I forget who I was?
Did I forget just where I came from?
Did I just lose who I am?
This is the fine line I stand

(A feast of apathy, a shot of angst)

I carried you away
(Taking all your blame)
I dropped you in the gutter
(Hid you and protected)
Just to watch you scream

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We save with violence and lie with eloquence
We're turning wine into water with abhorrence
We'll save whoever we want to

[Chorus]
Did I forget who I was?
Did I forget just where I came from?
Did I just lose who I am?
This is the fine line I stand

[Bridge]
I'm not so confident
I'm going to be the one who takes the next step
I'm a cyclone, passion overblown
Tied to the tides that pull me in the undertow
Where the wind blows is where my body's thrown
And I can't fight it
Maybe we should walk away from this
Take our proverbial walk into the sunset
Maybe we are destined to be different
We were designed for more resilience than this
But we don't know how and we live in the now
If we were smarter maybe we would try to fake it
Maybe we should walk away from this
And stop being ourselves, just stop being yourself
If you want to be happy

[Chorus]
Did I forget who I was?
Did I forget just where I came from?
Did I just lose who I am?
This is the fine line I stand

[Outro]
This is the fine line I stand (Amid the roar)
This is the fine line I...
