Tell me will you change
Will you break with those billions of hearts
Will you break, times are wasted
Minds are racing, troubles making
And I am sitting here waiting on you
I am sitting here waiting to move

(x4)
Can we can we
Wake up, take off
Let go, move on
Keep on, stay strong
You can make it on the roadYou might also like
