Run run Rudolph Vixen can't be far behind
Run run Rudolph Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry; tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph spinning like a merry go round
Said Santa to the boy child what would you be longing for
All I want for Christmas is a rock and roll electric guitar
Then away went Rudolph streaking like a shooting star
Run run Rudloph Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry; tell him he can take the freeway down
Run run Rudolph spinning like a merry go round

(go go go)

Said Santa to the girl child what would you be pleased most to get
A little Barbie doll that can cry sleep drink and wet
Then away went Rudolph streaking like a Citation jet
Run run Rudolph Santa got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry; tell him he can take the interstate down
Run run Rudolph spinning like a merry go round
... round round round round round
Run run Rudolph Santa's got to make it to town
Santa make him hurry; tell him he can take the freeway down
