And I trust you to never be around

You will eat me out of house and hall
You'll drink me dry and steal from me
If we arrange to meet at eight
You'll be late guaranteed

Hey, hey, hey
I'll take you on again
Hey, hey, hey
I'll take you on again

You never can quit
And you always come back wanting more
But I always got less than
I have bargained for

You compare me to an angel
Yes, Lucifer, I fell for you
Fall on someone else
'Cause I've got better things I wanna do

Hey, hey, hey
I'll take you on again
Hey, hey, hey
I'll take you on again
You might also likeYou never have said sorry
You never apologize
You're makin' me nervous
You're trouble in disguise

Can we pick up where it started?
Where it ended, you know what I mean
My mother had warned me
"Don't go back to where you've been"

Hey, hey, hey
I'll take you on again
Hey, hey, hey
I'll take you on again

Hey, hey, hey
I'll take you on again
Hey, hey, hey
I'll take you on again
