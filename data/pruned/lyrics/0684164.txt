What do you know?
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?

[Verse 1]
From the nave and down unto the altar
I left my momma sitting in the pew
Knelt before the trembling pastor
Fainted as he touched my trembling hand

[Chorus]
What do you know?
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?
Show me your stones
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?

[Verse 2]
Momma held me up through the rapture
Dragged me through the eyes and the whispers
Lost my spirit out the car window
Batted by righteous, righteous hands
You might also like[Chorus]
What do you know?
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?
Show me your stones
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?

[Bridge]
But now I'm not afraid
I know that love is stranger
Held up and writhing in the light
No, I'm not ashamed
There really is no danger
Give me life
Give me life
Give me life

[Chorus]
What do you know?
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?
Show me your stones
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?
What do you know?
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?
Show me your stones
I'm just a bad believer
What do you know?
What do you know?
