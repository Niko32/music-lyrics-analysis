Got to use her

[Verse 1]
Every time I feel fascination
I just can't stand still, I've got to use her
Every time I think of what you put me through, dear
Fascination moves, sweeping near me
Still, I take you

[Chorus]
(Fascination) Fascination
(Sure enough) Fascination
(Takes a part of me) Takes a part of me
(Can a heartbeat) Can a heartbeat
(Live in the fever) Live in the fever?
(Raging inside of me?)
(Fascination) Fascination
(Oh, yeah) Oh, yeah
(Takes a part of me) Takes a part of me
(I can't help it) I can't help it
(I've got to use her) I've got to use her
(Every time) Fascination comes around

[Verse 2]
If your soul is calling like when I'm walking
Seems that everywhere I turn I hope you're waiting for me
I know that people think that I'm a little crazy
Ooh, pleasure seeks this thing, I think I like fascination
Still, I take you
You might also like[Chorus]
(Fascination) Fascination
(Sure enough) Fascination, ooh
(Takes a part of me) Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
(Can a heartbeat) Can my heartbeat
(Live in the fever) Live in the fever
(Raging inside of me?) Raging inside of me?
(Fascination) Fascination
(Oh, yeah) Oh, yeah
(Takes a part of me) Come on, come on, come on, come on
(I can't help it) I can't help it
(I've got to use her) I've got to, ah
(Every time) Every time fascination comes around

[Chorus]
(Fascination) Sure enough
(Sure enough) Takes a part of me
(Takes a part of me) Can a heartbeat, my heartbeat
(Can a heartbeat) Live in the fever
(Live in the fever) Raging?
(Raging inside of me?) Fascination
(Fascination) Fascination
(Oh, yeah) Fascination
(Takes a part of me) Fascinate, fa-, oh, babe
(I can't help it) Fascination
(I've got to use her) I've got to use her
(Every time) Every time fascination comes around
[Post-Chorus]
Coming around

Can a heartbeat live in the fever raging inside of me?
Fascination takes a part of me

Every time, every time
Every time fascination comes around
