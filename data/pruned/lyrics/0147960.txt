He had big brown eyes
Beautiful lies
And a smile to keep me warm for days
But he always made me chase him around in his maze
I had to get up, get out, get off this ride
I had to get away
I always knew deep down, he wasn’t right for me
I wanna find a beautiful mind
So perfectly, packaged for me
Tailor made like a little girl’s dream

[Chorus]
I want milk and honey
I want love and money
I only want cake if I can eat it too
Then wash it all down with a man that’s true
Milk and honey

[Verse 2]
Flash back to another man
Stuck in the palm of my hand
I tried to spice him up, but he always came out bland
If he’d a stood up, spoke out, took a chance on life enough to make me care
Maybe we’d still be making out somewhere
I wanna find a beautiful mind
So perfectly, packaged for me
Tailor made like a little girl’s dream
You might also like[Chorus]

[Outro]
I’m not gonna sit here and wait
No time to waste
I’m gonna get my milk and honey
