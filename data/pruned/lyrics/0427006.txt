I used to run in a young man's boots
With a young man's heart
And a young man's roots
But now I stand where a young man stood before
I don't run like I used to
This old man don't run no more
You used to talk
And I used to nod
I don't listen
But I hear a lot
Don't believe for a second
That my key won't fit your door
I don't want you like I used to
This old man wants you more

[Chorus]
Hey hidee ho
I used to go where the devil wouldn't go
Where the river run still
And the water don't flow
Heaven couldn't stop me then
Hey
Hidee hi
Good lord willing
And the creek don't rise
And life goes by
Like the fireflies
Where the devil sits with a grin
You might also like[Verse 2]
I used to sing with a young man's voice
A young man's heart
And a young man's choice
Hope my song is what you're longing for
I don't sing like I used to
Sometimes less is more

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Well this crazy life is all we got
Like a shoestring tied in a beggar's knot
In the end that's what this story shows
I don't love you like I used to
This old man loves you more
I don't love ya like a used to
This old man loves you more
