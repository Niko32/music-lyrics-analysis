Get up there tonight, I can feel the pain
Coming through my veins, yeah
But girl just because I have to say goodbye
Doesn't mean you have to go, yeah

Hope you call sometime tonight
Hope you drop by tonight
Hope you dance for life
Cause I...

I.. am gonna drop someone a line
Finally I've been waiting for all this time
To drop someone a line
And girl you and I are smoking tonight
Drop someone a line
And that someone is you.........!

[Beat Break]

In my head, right in the middle of the bed
I'm thinking of you girl, yeah
But girl just because I have to say goodbye
Doesn't mean you have to go, yeah
You might also likeHope you call sometime tonight
Hope you drop by tonight
Hope you dance for life
Cause I...

I.. am gonna drop someone a line
Finally I've been waiting for all this time
To drop someone a line
And girl you and I are smoking tonight
Drop someone a line
And that someone is you.........!

Drop someone a line!!
Drop someone a line!!
Drop someone a line!!
And that someone is you.........!
