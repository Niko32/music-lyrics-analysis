You made those vows you made to me, in person
Then when your love has lost its glow
You said your friend to let me know
I wish you would have told me so, in person
I placed my ring upon your hand, in person (in person)
I should have got it back again, in person (in person)
But so afraid my tears would start
You said your friend to do your part
You really should have broke my heart, in person
If love is gone then I can't understand
But it hurts so much to hear it second hand
I once appeared at your front door, in person (in person)
But I won't appear there anymore, in person (in person)
And though you send someone you knew
To tell me that our love was through
I know I'll still be missing you, in person
I know I'll still be missing you, in person...You might also like
