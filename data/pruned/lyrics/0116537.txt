Show up in your lace
Drink up little girl
And they will always let you down
Hold your mother's pearl

[Verse 2]
Show up in your lace
Up to your cheekbones
Prevention is the only cure
Kiss them through windows

[Verse 3]
Throw up in your plate
Look angelical
If you sleep before I arrive
I'll pray for you, my girl

[Refrain]
A flower on fire
And I will always let you down

[Interlude]
