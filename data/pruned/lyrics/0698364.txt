I was eight years old when my granddaddy died
He that showed me the signs, I still miss him sometimes
Been a long time ago, but his words still ring true
"Son, whatever you do, be a seeker"

[Verse]
All these years, I have wandered wherever I roamed
I was never alone or forsaken, I know
Somewhere way out yonder, I know I will find
That a bright beacon shines for a seeker

[Verse]
You can't always believe your eyes
It's your heart that sees through all the lies
And the first answer follows the first question asked
The mystery unmasked by the seeker

[Verse]
In a world filled of sorrow, hunger, and pain
It's so hard to explain why I'm still traveling
There's a new day tomorrow and maybe I'll hold
Something brighter than gold to a seeker

[Verse]
You can't always believe your eyes
It's your heart that sees through all the lies
And the first answer follows the first question asked
The mystery unmasked by the seekerYou might also like
