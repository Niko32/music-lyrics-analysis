There's not an ounce of softness
Left within this weathered heart
The hand against the nap of fur
Disturbs that sleeping part
No need for caution, don't need remorse
That close to cryin'
Bristled and borne an altered force
That close to cryin'

[Verse 2]
Semi-automatic steel gray
Hollow eyes how they stare back
Impassively mechanically
Annoyed in bluish black
A twitching tail, a nervous finger
That close to cryin'
What tension waiting to slash in anger
That close to cryin'

[Verse 3]
A click of light and then a flash
Of any action taken
Illumined mystery clear and sharp
And all of my own making
A shattering crack, a full report
That close to cryin'
Released and slack, a slumping form
That close to cryin'
You might also like[Verse 4]
That close to cryin' is not close at all
What line of fire was crossed?
No cerebral contemplation
Of carefully altered thought
No hail Mary, no desperate toss
That close to cryin'
The wave awaited recedes in loss
That close to cryin'
That close to cryin'
That close to cryin'
