When it's Christmas time in Texas
It's a very special time for me
In Texas we'll be swinging 'round the Christmas tree
Dancing to a Christmas melody
When it's Christmas time in Texas
It might look just like a summer day
There may not be snow in San Antonio
But it's a Texas Christmas to me

[Chorus]
When Santa crosses over the border
He'll sound a little different when he sings
'Cause he'll hear those twin fiddles playing
Christmas songs with a touch of western swing
There may not be snow in San Antonio
But it's a Texas Christmas to me

[Verse 2]
When it's Christmas time in Texas
I love to hear those Christmas carolers sing
People on the go, children's faces all aglow
Wondering what Santa's gonna bring
Grandpa's been chasing grandma around
Trying to catch her 'neath the mistletoe
Everything is right, the lone star's shining bright
And it's a Texas Christmas to me
You might also like[Chorus]
When Santa crosses over the border
He'll sound a little different when he sings
'Cause he'll hear those twin fiddles playing
Christmas songs with a touch of western swing
There may not be snow in San Antonio
But it's a Texas Christmas to me
And here's wishing you all a merry Christmas
Merry Christmas from Texas and me
