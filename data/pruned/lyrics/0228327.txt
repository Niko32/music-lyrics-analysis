That you wrote to me
It's you that I am thinking of
As I read the lines
That to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love
I miss you darlin' more and more every day
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love
--- Instrumental ---
I think of the past
And all the pleasures we've had
As I watch the mating of the doves
It was in the springtime
That you said goodbye
And I remember our faded love
I miss you darlin' more and more every day
As Heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love...You might also like
