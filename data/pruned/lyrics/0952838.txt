Believe me, i have been there before
It's not the language of love that you're missin
It's fear of what was spoken before

That's why i think its time i brought it up
To keep you from givin up
Don't you know that you'll find love somehow, someway
But only when you look my way

Leave it to me and your heart will be answered
This is what i guarantee
Its not a question, it's a promise that i'm keepin
Sendin it to you from me

That's why its time i brought it up
To keep you from givin up
Don't you know that you'll find love somehow, someway
But only when you look my way

Wishin that we were more than we are
If only for a moment
Takin our chances and you seem so far away
Under the moonlight, we reach for it all
Your eyes are shining brighter than i know
Under the stars that are starting to fall
You might also likeIts time i brought it up
To keep you from givin up
Don't you know that you'll find love somehow, someway
But only when you look my way
