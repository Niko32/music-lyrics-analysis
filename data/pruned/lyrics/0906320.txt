So many people are on a search to find
Within their days for that place
Within their minds to hide
And dump the load of this worldly life
And the things that it can make you feel and do
Just to pass away your time

[Chorus]
But you'll be alright, yeah
'Cause if you just hold on, be strong
You, you'll be alright
Yes, you will, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
People have a tendency to think to themselves
That they're the only ones
Going through more things than anyone else
But oh-oh, I bet you'll beg to differ
If you would just consider the much bigger picture
'Cause then you would see
That most people go through the same things that you do in life

[Chorus]
But you'll be alright, yeah
'Cause if you can take it
You surely can make it
You, you'll be alright, yeah, oh yeah, yeah

We share our pain (We share our pain)
So it doesn't matter at all (Oh-oh-ho)
We're all the same (So you'll be alright, yeah)
