I'm falling in love tonight
Somehow I know
The beautiful world tonight
Is sharing its glow

When love let me down before
I said I was through
But I'm falling in love tonight
With you

[Bridge]
Till you walked by
I laughed and played the game
One kiss, then goodbye
And out went the flame

[Verse 2]
But somehow, you've changed me, dear
This time it's true
I'm falling in love tonight
With youYou might also like
