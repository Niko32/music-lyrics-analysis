The GOAT of rap is back
About to spit something that ain't whack
:hah:

It's been a while but the GOAT is back, like I left a farm
And I'm a spit some shit that's really warm
Came back because niggas forgot;that I ran the game
After this, nothing will be the same
Like that light skinned sensitive ass nigga Drake
The one that made a song with Jay talking about Cake
Both of ya got no cake, especially you Jay
You struggling to reach the worth of a billion
While each word I say is worth a trillion
Bum ass nigga, I'm finna ether you and Aubrey
Drake the type of nigga to cry after he fought me
Like how you named after a shade of color
If I was your dad I would of used a rubber, Damn!
I feel like Hopsin dissing others for no reason
I influenced every single rapper that's breathing
I'll catch hopsing slipping and make him hop in
My red and black datson
Drive off to a river and dive out...on some Eminem shit
Fuck Eminem, his new album sucked ass
I'll show him a Bad Guy by getting that nigga slapped
By the niggas on my block that always trap
Fuck Big Sean, Jay Electron and Kendrick
That nigga wants to go to jail to suck a bunch of men dick
He loves it when other men get control of him
Small dyke looking ass nigga with that sus ass grin
Calling out the whole fucking mainstream like Fifty
Asap Rocky's sexuality seems to be a little shifty
This nigga dressed like a female wearing dresses
He's basically sended us a subliminal message
Fuck all of Asap, They A Squad of Ass Pussies
And this be that nigga named thumbs
The one that gets bread and buns while ya get crumbs. :HAH:
