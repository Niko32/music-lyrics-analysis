Walk out before you make it worse on yourself
Now's not the time for that elegant laugh
Daggers from the people once by your side
Once by your side but, now that is over
Have to pick up
And just start again, start again

[Verse 2]
You've fallen to Earth and you're collared in ice
But burning yourself ain't no challenge to winter
Gotta clip the lines and move for yourself
Just move for yourself, love
Now that it's over, have to pick up
And just watch your back, watch your back

[Chorus]
And close your eyes to run
Far, far
Trap doors to endless fields of young land
Have we grown too tired on our land to fight

[Verse 3]
Look, Valentine, if you want it to end
Your life at this temperature, life underwater
You've gotta let these fools all trample themselves
They trample themselves, just dying to enter
You're preaching to the choir
So turn around, turn around
You might also like[Chorus]
And close your eyes to run
Far, far
Trap doors to endless fields of young land
Have we grown too tired on our land to fight

And close your eyes to run
Far, far
Trap doors to endless fields of young land
Have we grown too tired on our land to fight
