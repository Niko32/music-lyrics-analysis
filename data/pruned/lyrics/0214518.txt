It could be real deep
You could tell me that you cannot sleep
But I'm
I'm just trying to get high

Woke up Monday weed on the brain
Tuesday Wednesday feeling the same
Thursday Friday playing the game
I fucked Saturday and Sunday I came

Woke up Monday drinks on my mind
Tuesday Wednesday thinking I'm fine
Thursday Friday drinking inside
Cause the last two weeks was just a waste of time

You could write me a letter
It could be real deep
You could tell me that you cannot sleep
But I'm
I'm just trying to get high

I hit up Tommy cause his mommy got oxies
Now johnny try to bother cause he thinks I got roxies
You know the routine wake up score and cop
A twenty ball of crack yep stuffed in my sock
Took a bus to pain management worth the trip
But couldn't make it to the pharmacy to fill my script
All in all i had a good day snorted good yay
I'm just trying to get high and live it my way

Woke up Monday weed in the bong
Tuesday Wednesday dragging along
Thursday Friday it's the same old song
I want Saturday and Sunday gone

Woke up last week feeling so rich
Woke up this week feeling like shit
I feel like I'm just nearing my end
Everybody's only worried about dividends

You could write me a letter
It could be real deep
You could tell me that you cannot sleep
But I'm
I'm just trying to get high
