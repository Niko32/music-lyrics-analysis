I can assure you, you got nothing to do here
On you soft, little face
Hey, fool you got any business ??
I can assure you, here's no business for you
You can only lose your head
You can only get heated!
O.K fool, so you want to play
But are your prepared to take the risk ??
I Don't think, that you will leave rich
I Don't think, that you will leave healthy !!!
Dirty money
Dirty tricks
What's the swamp
Everybody wants to cheat me !!You might also like
