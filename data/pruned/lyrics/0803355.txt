I'm weary of this melody
Because, because
I want to get up off my knees
Because, because
I'm tired of chasing you around
Because, because
I'm lying prostrate on the ground

And when I'm tired, I'm so very tired
And when it's done, it's like I've killed someone

Because, because
I'm sick of all the bones you throw
Because, because
There's nothing from the seeds you sow
Because, because
I can't remember why I'm here
Because, because
It's all become so crystal clear

And when I'm tired, I'm so very tired
And when it's done, it's like I've killed someone

Because, because
