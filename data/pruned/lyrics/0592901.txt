I'm a person
Not a number
You take your time
It makes me wonder
She's by my side
Until we stop
She likes to dance
To disco rock
Then you let me
Come and get me
I feel alone
So don't you stop
So don't you stop

[Hook: Oh Land]
My teeth and soul, my hair
My person, oh my care
And my parents show my fears
My grief, my soul, right here

My teeth and soul, my hair
My person, oh my care
And my parents show my fears
My grief, my soul, right here

We need more mouthful
We slide across floor
We learn my turn
Go slow but be firm
Be good, be bad
Be mad, be sad
Be first, be twice
Be good, be nice
Need more, real near
Lose you, my real fear
[?] more before
Leave toward a new car
Don't you stop

[Hook]
My teeth and soul, my hair
My person, oh my care
And my parents show my fears
My grief, my soul, right here


So don't you stop
So don't you stop

[Bridge: Oh Land]
I'm on the stairs
Do you care
I was there
I'm the wicked I can deal
Where you go
The door, the door
I'm so sick and tired
Lying low
The door, the door
So don't you stop

[Hook] '
My teeth and soul, my hair
My person, oh my care
And my parents show my fears
My grief, my soul, right here

My teeth and soul, my hair
My person, oh my care
And my parents show my fears
My grief, my soul, right here
