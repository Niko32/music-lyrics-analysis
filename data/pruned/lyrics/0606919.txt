I'd walk through fire
Take on the shadows
I do anything
For you, my love
I'd risk it all without thinking
All I can think about is holding on

[Chorus]
When my world feels like it's flying up above the rain
Caught up in emotions that I can't explain
It's a never ending feeling I can't get enough of
I can't live without you baby, that's what I call love

[Verse 2]
Money talks, people listen
Some, they don't understand what it's all about
Cause it can't be bought, it's only given
Now that it's come along, there ain't no doubt

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Well I thought I'd looked in every corner
And I swore I'd opened every door
Just when I was giving up
I finally found the one that I'd been searching for
You might also like[Chorus]

[Outro]
I can't live wihout you baby, that's what I call love
