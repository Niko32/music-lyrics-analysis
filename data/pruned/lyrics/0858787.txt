Now today I want you back
Always seem to strive for
All the things I lack
Yesterday, it was my freedom
Now today it's you
I'm always caught in the middle
Can't seem to follow through
Can't seem to follow through
It's not that I don't love you
It's just that I'm scared to death
Beneath my fear, I'm smotherin'
So I run to catch my breath
Then I burn my bridges
Just like I always do
I'm always caught in the middle
Can't seem to follow through
Can't seem to follow through
When I've lost my way
The road always leads right back to you
Every night I pray
For the strength to follow through
What else can I do?
Then I get that feeling
Ya know the one I can't resist
I've got to see your body
Feel the warmth of your tender kiss
I finally found the answer
All I need is you
I think this time baby
I'll finally follow through
I'll finally follow through
I'll finally follow throughYou might also like
