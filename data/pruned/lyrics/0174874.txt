I feel my time is slipping away
(Every minute gone by seems like a day)
I'll never get back the things I lost along the way

[Pre-Chorus]
What the hell is wrong with me?
This isn't who I'm supposed to be

[Chorus]
(Wooah) I feel all alone everyday
(Wooah) And just so far away
(Wooah) I know something's got to change
(Wooah) Inside of me!

[Verse 2]
What is it that I'm running from?
(My head is like a loaded gun)
Every thought is trapped inside this web I've spun

[Pre-Chorus]
What the hell is wrong with me?
This isn't who I'm supposed to be!

[Chorus]
(Wooah) I feel all alone everyday
(Wooah) And just so far away
(Wooah) I know something's got to change
(Wooah) Inside of me!
You might also like
[Chorus]
(Wooah) I feel all alone everyday
(Wooah) And just so far away
(Wooah) I know something's got to change
(Wooah) Inside of me!
Me!!
