Let's get this going

[FIRST VERSE: God]
Flow so white you’d think I was a cracker
Uh, work of art, call me Cesare Borgia
So it’s King Push, not Cyhi on my playlist
I don’t rhyme, I prophesize like the B.I.B.L.E
[Verse V2: DC26]
You, You, You, You, You, You

These are the songs we used to sing
This is how we do the thing
Got my IQ no lying needed
Oi, better get the sharks feeding
Yeah, that's how we do it
Yeah, just bit by bit
Yeah, I'll just tell you
We could do a threesome or two

[Verse notreallyshitty: Shitface Smellah]
RG you know how we do it man
No other forum can do it like we can
Tryna get this CREAM while makin' ‘em say ’‘wow’‘
Though we ain’t gon suck no dick for it like Bow Wow
I don’t ball like LeBron because I’ve never flopped
Talk shit about me and you’ll get your fucking brain popped
My dick like wi-fi cause it connects these hoes
Meanwhile I got 20 bitches on my bed who ain’t friends nor foes

[Verse laffballin: Ha Baller]
Ayo we Chiraq we dreamin'
Always stay schemin'
And you can get the cough syrup
Cuz we always stay leanin'
[Verse spirit: Sail Ciph]
Merry Christmas, I’m holding mistletoe
Above my head for kisses, I hope I get some mo'
Merry Christmas, I’m holding mistletoe
Above my head for kisses, I hope I get some mo'
It’ll remind me of years Christmas steered
All of the pretty Christmas dears away
And with your Christmas ears I’ll say
Merry Christmas and other winter holidays
[Verse legoblock: Bobby The Builder]
I fuck bitches, call it beastiality
I only love the ac in actuality
Yeah, the pussy ball like its hairless
With these bullets I'm not generous like Ellen

[Verse whatafiasco: CSF]
They call me CSF like what it stands for, of course it's
Not Cum Swallowing Faggot, Cerebro-spinal fluid, not Clear Soul Forces
Fiending pretty hard right now for some RG swag merchandise
Underrated? I did that SG, that RG, y'all heard me right???
The God editor, the Zeus of these editor plebs yo
And that goes for Captain Nig, MMS, BreakingBadTheGoatTVShow
Lucidity, Yawk-Yawk, Kryptic, Savvy, Illest Son
Jerome on his good days, that whitehat MFV, that’s it I’m done

[Verse :cryfam:: macmillerstan]
I got the dik in bae, no Mutombo
Wumbo
I miss my bitch cuz she was perfect
She made everything worth it
4 more bars huh?
I wish girls loved me as much as they do pizza
And searching for happiness in every single way
But for now my sky is forever grey ;_;

[Verse fetish: Pakyed]
I need to get this off my chest, like women with breast cancer
I have a fetish to develop AIDS, just to make it spread faster
Fuck a sexy dime on her legs till she’s aching to leave
She got a Sixty-Nine on the test, So I gave her the D

[Verse whathappenedtorighthands: LeftHandedMonkeyWrench]
I walk in with confidence like ‘you ain’t stoppin this’
Not you, him, her, or it are safe from my apocalypse
I’m a terror squad, no astronmist but leave ya full o' clips
Feel ya life slip, Nas snuffed Jesus and I made his father slip
I’m sin incarnate, lyrically I’m evil’s embodiment
Pissing greatness in this cypher, I’m just marinating condiments
So garnish it, embrace it in your throat and don’t tarnish it
Cuz You, me, and all the lords know how full your style of garbage is

[Verse 370: Nigachu]
ScopeY said to make this verse humorous
Now I gotta pull the funny bone up from under my humerus
What’s thick, six inches, and made my girl cry when I fed it to her?
This dead baby that slipped out of her uterus

[Hook]

[Verse explosion: TomaczeQ]
I am not famous I am not in magazines
But you know what? I am bout to blow up: GASOLINE
You can't blow up even if you are a terrorist
Ill show you what hysterics is, you gonna go to therapist

[Verse pokey gang: Yung Nasty da Gro$$man]
Yung G comin straight out the bayou
You know I prolly bald like my name was Caillou
I rob the damn money store with a loaded grenade
I just bought me an ostrich RIP Lil Wayne
Yeah nigga topside POKEY GANG nigga!
Yeah watch out for gat damn hoop snakes nigga!
I just bought a school bus nigga!
Bitch I’m Dirk Nowitzki nigga!
[Verse s: ZXQaos]
Sick, with the syllables
Similar to a synonym for sibilance, simp-ily
Satan’s Sini-sister in a soliloquy, imagery
Comes quicker than an inner killer with-in me
To simmer sinners for dinner inta an itinerary
To a literal, literary, place; where I can’t be hate-ed
For my amaze-ing, underrate-ed, quality
An apology, for the honest anomaly; Zade, rhapsody and a homily

[Verse beretta: GenieYus]
Got gats, two nines, one Beretta
Got hoes, two nines, one better
Ya bitch may, not be beyond Jay’s Beyonce
But she’ll be on my dick, or be on her way

[Verse generous: S34F00D]
The most creepiest, insidious, hideous MC
Villainous, conspicuous and continuous lyrics on your .mp3
The most mysterious, delirious and oblivious mind you’ll see
So follow me
My rhymes gives the blind sight
My bars gives paraplegics flight
My music gives the weak might
My people is what keeps the fight

[Verse regular: Yung Nignog]
Dropping deposits until my bank account freezes
Your bitch she stays on my wood like Jesus
First off I’m not explaining shit so unless you want a beatin'
You should step the fuck off cause 2nd u not eatin'
The squad finna take over RG one day at a time
Spittin these ill rhymes I’ll fuck your bitch and put it on vine
Spit some corn and I’ll pop you in the head
Daily reminder that Ry is all about that bread

[Verse #whataryousaying: YEAHTIM]
Tomato sauce all on my belly, all on my belly
The way I jam on the song, I know you get jelly
Dollar amount so big caused my account to crash
Not a good thing when I say you come faster than Flash
They say it’s the end, so I’mma go out swinging
What I mean is I’ll be with your wife flinging
Strong genes, give birth on the day of the reckoning
Give life to the new age, I’m such a blessing, kid

[Verse izzle: Big D (Dennismate)]
Chizzle my nizzles while i spizzle these rhizzles
Yo mums on my dick and I’m starting to jizzle
Think my rhymes are funny? haha have a giggle
This shit is for fun, no fucks not a single

[Verse truname: Laserdick Sharkpussy]
Limo riding, Bacardi sippin
She put her back up to a legend like she was Scottie Pippen
You take away the fame, these rappers got no dignity
She gave mind blowing brain, called her John F. Kennedy
[Verse what: MC Penetration]
Suck so much dick like a vacuum
I let him fuck me in the backroom
Bust a nut on my face, call it cashew
Now there’s white everywhere, his stash blew

[Verse noteventrill: Yung Trillby]
Yung trillby in the building u male cis gelding
What’s a god to a king who rejects illogical things
Call me Dr. Jumba Jookiba the way i be givin u stitches
Step foot in my crib, a baby surrounded by bitches
Am i Jesus, Judas or maybe even Papoose
I’m part of a champion crew call me Marco Reus
RG gonna see some Savvy mods by February
An actual good mod, good desicision by the patriarchy

[Verse almost slick: Slickkster]
Got a 40 taped to each hand call me Edward 40 hands
Laughing to the bank cause I got cheddar 40 bands
When your bitch approached my ass I was like, “nothnxjeff"
But when I’m laying in my bed I’m like, "tfw no gf”

[Verse homie: EmperorAguila]
It’s the cantabile Cannibal with the claws of pressured animal
Radical yet rational, ya need an extra lecture, Hannibal?
Mad manhunter crunching rhymes like Sheppard’s manacles, your'e in
The hands of a bandit bro, not affable, this axolotl’s actionable
Lead painting the picture, Schiele ain't even with ya
I’m Monet chasing a vision, the realest, Manet needs an ism
Yet Picasso is awful when compared to the rarest veal
Aguila’s a thief, ya, devour the sour Bueller, Ferris wheel

[Verse w0w: M.C Clit-Tickler 4000]
Incest is a legit past-time, ingest a bit of yo sis vag grime
Nibble her clit, takin a sip, bottle of yo daddies moonshine
Ridin in the pick-up n stickin your prick up, yo mummas crusty be-hine-d
Sharin a bed and a bloodline, life of a redneck is bliss

[Hook]

[Verse superbad: Yung McLovin]
OH MY GOD IT’S IN, LET’S GO
Superbad bars, better break yourself bitch
Been buying booze, got IDs with one name each
Pack a vest, protect my Pinocchio
Fog el camino with endo I got from the 5-0
Poking holes in hoes man I nose better
Long dick, qt glasses and I’m fly as a feather
Aim the Smith at yo miss but I don’t miss doe
Fuck it, it’s 10:33, time to end the show
…It was between that or Muhammed

[Verse notRandySavage: Yung Savage]
Ayo, shooting your squad like there’s nothing to it, Michael Jordan of the streets
When I’m with your bitch I’m Wilt Chamberlain in the sheets
You’re running from the heat, trying to be a cavalier
But running from the heat shows your real fear

[Verse unreal: Bruce Leeroy]
Bruce Leeroy, you fgts are true decoys
Trash squad is number one, we ain’t making that cheap noise/
Bring the toys out boy scout, koi trout
Smokin salmon like u was smokin a whole ounce, make them hoes bounce

Unreal

[Verse #lyricality: Lyrical god]
Its that biblical lyrical empirical, satirical
Cereal, clerical, clinical, critical, cynical, lyrically
Mericle, miracle, miracles, mystical, physical, pinnacle
Quizzical, serial, spherical, spiracle, typical, whimsical
With some chronic, sonic, tonic, bubonic, teutonic
Laconic, iconic, ironic, moronic, masonic, platonic bars
Abolition, acquisition, admonition, ammunition, apparition, bad condition, coalition, combat mission, competition, composition rhymes

[Verse ancient: Dino]
Quick PSA: fuck everybody!
This is Rap Genius Virgin Losers vs Everybody
Got no game with the hoes but we know karate
Make Santa put us on the list of the naughty
That fucker too fat for my smokestack anyways
[Verse rulebreaker: Vesuvius]
Scope gave me four bars, I only need two
To wipe the floor with all of you

[Verse Napdisser: Gurses]
Nappy's a cunt
He uses nappys
Nappy's a cunt
He uses nappys
[Verse -0: P-Breezy]
No verse cryfam, I’m no Stan of Mac Miller
I am a fan though, so I blow games like Jonas Hiller
No homo, private jet touch down like Tony Romo
(Ha) Just kidding, I don’t even got a car
Black birds eating metal, call that crow bar (Tunechi)
I’m better than J. Cole, Jay-Z, I’m the third born star
Seguin, Benn, I’m Spezza, I’m out here eatin’ pizza
You’ll respect me like Aretha, Franklin the turtle
Read Yertle until it’s time to murder
These quote-unquote rappers, M&Ms and Skittles
I’m a be a hall of famer, like all these Y.A. Tittles
Munchin’ on some vittles, home runs like Josh Vitters
These bars are hard hitters…

[Hook]

Verse ♛ - Sho
I AM A KING, THESE HOES BOW DOWN
IAMAKING THESE HOES BOW DOWN
I AM MAKING THESE HOES BOW DOWN

[Salehe1]
I wanted a kings throne, and now im down at its feet
And Ill keep going im up in the seat
And they all take defeat, cause these dudes suck like a leach
Im 17 but im coming to teach because the worlds in my reach

[Eddz]
The shit I spit is hotter than Sofia Vergara
Boiling water in a sauna in the middle of Tijuana
But when I get on tracks I slaughter, it’s disturbing for real
I’d make you gag after jacking off to A Serbian Film!
All these others cats tryna bite me more cat than piranha
So I brush em while smoking green till I can’t breathe like Eric Garner
And like Daniel Pantaleo I should prolly die cus I’m sick
But try to find me while I’m busy cutting off Kim Jong Un’s tiny dick

[Donny Ra$kal]
I had ma shit straight, in the fifth grade, I was spitting rhymes, sharper than a switchblade
Every battle, every cypher, every lunchtime, nobody ever felt safe from a punchline
You needed permission, to join a cypher of mine, it was like playing with a fire, you put your life on the line
And I treated any battle, like a fist fight, I went ham, went harder than a pit’s bite
You couldn't hide, and you couldn’t run fam, you would be stuck, like a bullet when a gun jams
And I was spitting shit, hotter than the sun man, damn, I would leave the whole crowd wit a sun tan
I used to do this shit, for the hell of it, but nowadays, niggas wanna battle for the relevance
But ima run thru the game, in ma old Rebox, and I ain’t gon stop, till I hear Detox

[Zoltan Nebula A.K.A. Thug Nasty, Nasty Thug, A.K.A. Scumbag Of Groceries]
I’m the lyrical miracles favourite lyrical miracle
I’m so bad it’s sad, call it “Tear-able”
Sicker than sick, not curable with seroquel
My lyrics run laps around your brain, call it spherical lyrical
I’ll run up in your house during your family reunion
Yell “Shit piss fuck cunt”….I’ll Blink 182 them!!
Yeah, I’ll fuckin suck your mommas dick
Fuck and suck your mommas mommas tits

[King Chaos]
I'm 2014's General Khan
With an atomic bomb and magic fucking wand
Head of the illuminati, with a bomb strapped to me like I'm in benghazi
Running after these Neo Nazis
[BOOM]
I'll still survive the blast
Cause I will forever last
The only way to end my era
Is to end my reign of terra
But that's a suicide mission
And if you think you'll win, you must be tripping
Well hell, here take this gay pride L
I don't give an S, go suck a D
But don't you even dare step to me
Cause my I will rule forever B

[Verse super late to submit: TDotniggaxx]
I’m doing dirt like I help the planet
I’m catching bodies I don’t even plan it
Better plan it the next time you stack figures
The AK flips niggas like pancakes, that’s when I hop niggas

[Verse oneofthegreatesteverGeniusparodies: Jess MaQswell]
Marking things as spam
Is not a very hard job
They're like spam meat cans
So good, but then it's gone (ha ha ha)
Genius is just GOAT
And our future is bright
But not unless you all have fun
Fucking up spammers tonite, oh

Jingle bells, spammers spell
Like second graders
I know they're computers but
Computers should be smarter
Jingle bells, spammers smell
Worse than durian fruits
They should try think twice before
They spam our website too

[Verse idontevenknowanymore: dredre200064]
Alright
Don't take shots at the king
I'll make you kiss my fucking ring
And have you at me feet
Humming my beat
While you think of what you could've been
But these lines are wearing you thin
So I better stop now
Before you start asking how?
How is he so fucking good?
Corection: How is he so fucking great?
Well it's not even a fucking debate
Little bitch

[Hook]

[2nd to last verse:  Cordel]
Man 2014, why'd you have to go
Now 2015 gonna bring in more snow
Ima get pnemounia and die from the cold
Not the first time a nigga died from the white
And Ima keep rappin till I get money right
Give her them kisses in between the bitche's hips
Fuck that pink pussy nigga, I like them tight clits
I gotta thing for Caucasians, I think I might hit
Beat the pussy up worse than Michael Vick
Shit Chris Brown and Ray Rice got nothin on it
I don't like women abuse unless the bitch needs it
Slap em, punch em, kill em, and force your in your penis
Damn Slim must of possessed me cause Im gettin crazy
No wonder none of the girls I like won't date me
Wanna touch me you better pay a fee
Rap Genius, we goin world wide till 2023

[streetlights]
Eminem is trash
Chris brown is too
Kanye is a god
And so is Tyrant

[Last verse: Yung Minigun]

Niggas in the trap with the military weapons
Niggas in the trap, and they keep steppin
I like salt and pepper, apple soda better
Catch me on GTA 5 hitting up Lester
I throw balls like I'm Devin Hester
I come straight out of the orphanage, like I'm Esther
I'm a wide receiver, I will die a breeder
And I'm straight out of the hood
Like my neegers

[Hook]
