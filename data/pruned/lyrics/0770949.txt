There's really nothing to it, it's easy we love each other so
And we always will, I know, we found it long ago
And now we're sure that it's the kind to last forever

They ask me, can we make it? And I tell them, we love each other
If there's trouble, can we take it, I tell them, we love each other more
Than we ever have before and they should know
Then they ask me, how we do it, I just tell them, we love each other so

We love each other

We love each other more than we ever have before
And they should know when they ask me, how we do it
I just tell them, we love each other so
We love each other soYou might also like
