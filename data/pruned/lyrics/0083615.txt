I been in some hard times
I seen a lot of good times
But everyday I count my blessings this way
Cause I know that everyday's a different day
My friends can change
But his will never change
And I knew there would be some time
When I would second guess my mind

[Hook: T-Boz]
So I kept on walking
Kept on striving
Kept on singing and
Guess who showed up

[Verse 2: Raphael Saadiq]
As I walked down the street one day
I thought I heard a brother say:
Living in bad conditions
Can make you feel like no one
As long as I, that's why I always try
And do my best to search inside
But I knew there would be a day
When I had to look the other way
You might also like[Hook: Raphael Saadiq & T-Boz]
So I close my eyes and
Kept on pushin'
I just stopped looking
And guess who showed up

[Verse 3: T-Boz with Raphael Saadiq]
I told myself one day
To fall on my knees and pray
And never listen to no-one
If they can't be true to you
No one should spend precious time
Living for material love
His money, no money
No money, can make me happy
Now it looks a lot clearer outside
Cause I'm using my eyes

[Hook: T-Boz]
I close my eyes and
And kept on pushing
I just stopped looking
And guess who showed up

[Bridge: Raphael Saadiq & T-Boz]
My friend won't let you down
He's always been around
That's one thing I know for sure
Even when I'm wrong, he's right at my door
He'll never ignore
[Verse 4: Raphael Saadiq]
Yes, I got a lotta things to say
I can't say them in all one day
I'll take no credit for the blessings that he's given to me
Without him I know that Saadiq could never, ever, ever be
When I thought it couldn't get no better
Just when I thought it was almost over
Oh no

[Hook: Raphael Saadiq & T-Boz]
I close my eyes and
Kept on pushin'
I just stopped looking
And guess who showed up

[Hook: Raphael Saadiq & T-Boz]Ã—4
I close my eyes and kept on pushin'
I just stopped looking and guess who showed up
I told myself one day
To fall on my knees and pray

[Bridge]
