What good did you get out of breaking my heart
Did you feel of me when you said we must part
Did it make you happy to see my teardrops start
What good did you get out of breaking my heart
What good did you get out of making believe
You had lost your heart your loving heart to me
Now that it's over I ask you sweetheart
What good did you get out of breaking my heart
Is this just something you do from memories
Ever chance you get when you find someone like me
But if it makes you happy to tear a soul apart
Then you got a lot of good out of breaking my heart
Is this just somethingYou might also like
