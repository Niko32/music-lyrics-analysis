Hey girl
Run run run go now
Just go don’t look behind you
Hey girl
It’s more real than you know
Just go don’t look behind you

[Verse One]
Car ride in the summer time
Windows down I’m looking fine
Off to work in the factory
That’s where my nightmares haunting me
I don’t want to ever go back there
But the dudes at the bank don’t care
They give me that blank stare
As they strip my house bare
Repossessed like exorcism two
Emily Rose blind date with you
Head turns around there’s vomit on the bedsheets
Call in the priest beetle juice giving me grief
Like candy man candy man
Fix my lawn mower if you can
Run over the bee hive light that effigy ma’am
9 children of the corn surround my cabin
I guess it’s time to harvest before they get to stabbin
I just want to live easy, breezy
Take a road trip or have a party sleazy
I want all the girls to please me
But we know only the virgin always survives the dealings

[Verse Two]
College loans the horror show
Insidious strangers call you know
Centipedes impede my free seed
So it don’t grow
Doors closed so you don’t know
Who the slasher is
The lighter now don’t glow
You ask where the coffin is
Guess you’ll never find out
Life ain’t got no time out
You might as well bust a rhyme out
Whose gonna clean all the grime out
Of the sewer drain
Corn syrup red stain
Here’s Johnny he’s gone insane
And here’s a living evil brain
It’s alive and it can wield knives
And thrive on the fear of our wives
Eventually we’ll all take the dive
Freddy Kruger tax man
Melting statue wax man
Both hit you in the sack man
Take your money just lean back man
It’s only a movie it’s only a dream
Step out of the theater blinded by the sun’s hot gleam
Hot seat belt go on back to work
Wish you could reenact deliverance with your boss that jerk
[Hook]
