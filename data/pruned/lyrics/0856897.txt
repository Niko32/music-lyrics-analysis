In a world where few hearts survive
All I know is the way I feel
If it's real I'll keep it alive

The road is long
And there are mountains in our way
But we climb a step everyday

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagels cry on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the worlds we know
Up where the clear winds blow

Some hang on what used to be
They live their lives, looking behind
When all we have is here and now
All our lives up there to find

The road is long
And there are mountains in our way
But we climb a step everyday

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagels cry on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the worlds we know
Up where the clear winds blow
You might also likeTime goes by
No time to cry
Life's you and I
Alive. Today

Love lift us up where we belong
Where the eagels cry on a mountain high
Love lift us up where we belong
Far from the worlds we know
Up where the clear winds blow. x
