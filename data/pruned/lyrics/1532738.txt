This is the 'Coffee Blues.' I likes a certain brand: Maxwell's House, it's good till the last drop, just like it says on the can. I used to have a girl cookin' a good Maxwell House. She moved away. Some said to Memphis and some said to Leland, but I found her, and I wanted her to cook me some good Maxwell's House. Now understand if I can get me just a spoonful of Maxwell's House it'll do me much good as two or three cups this other coffee
