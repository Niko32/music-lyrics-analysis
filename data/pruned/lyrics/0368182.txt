If feels just like it was yesterday
We were in love
Why's it falling apart
I've never been one to walk away
But I've had enough
And it's breaking my heart
Cause you love me just the way that you should
It's nothing that you do, no, it's nothing you say
Yeah baby I know that you're good
But I don't want a good girl
No not today

[Chorus]
Cause I want it bad
I want a bad girl, baby bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I want a bad girl, baby bad
I want it bad

[Verse 2]
I want a girl that stays out too late
And when I call she doesn't answer the phone
Oh, I want a girl who likes it her way
And through it all, I know I'll end up alone
Yeah, yeah, you love me just the way that you should
It's nothing that you do
No, no, it's nothing you say
Oh pretty baby, I know that you're good
But I don't want a good girl
No not today, hmm...

Cause I want it bad
I want a bad girl, baby bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I want a fight
I want to rock and roll
And party all night

Yeah I want it bad
I want a bad girl, baby bad
I want it bad

[Bridge]
I'm getting sick of predictable
Tired of actin' logical
Oh yeah, I gotta shake it up tonight
Yeah girl I want something physical
Not something invincible
Oh yeah, I'm tired of being good
Let's be bad

[Chorus]
Cause I want it bad
I want a bad girl, baby bad
I want a love that's crazy, yeah
I want a bad girl, baby bad
I want it bad
