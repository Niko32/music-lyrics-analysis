Here before me
And I'm going to climb it
With strength not my own

He's gonna lead me
Or the mountain beats me
Carry me through
Carry me through

There's a river
Here before me
And I'm gonna cross it
With strength not my own

He's gonna save me
Or the river takes me
Carry me through
Carry me through

Oh, Lord, be gentle
I'm just a man
Please don't crush me
Help me in

Oh, Lord, remember
I try so hard
I walk and talk
Your kingdom love
You might also likeThere's a sinner
Here before me
And I'm gonna give them
Strength not my own

He's gonna carry me
When I get weary
Carry me through
Carry me through

Oh, Lord, be gentle
I'm just a man
Please don't crush me
And help me in

Oh, Lord, remember
I try so hard
I walk and talk
Your kingdom love

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Carry me through

Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Lord, Sweet Lord
Carry me through
