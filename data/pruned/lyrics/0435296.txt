Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
Up until the other day
There remained an empty space in my bed
Then I took one look at you
And naughty things that we could do
Dance within my head

[Chorus]
Never have I ever made love before
Never have I wanted to 'til now
Lover, can't you see I want you more and more?
Take me, baby, yeah, I'm yours

[Verse 2]
I'll give you what you want
But please love me now
I'll do anything you want
You're the teacher, show me how

[Chorus]
Never have I ever made love before
Never have I wanted to 'til now
Lover, can't you see I want you more and more?
Take me, baby, yeah, I'm yoursYou might also like
