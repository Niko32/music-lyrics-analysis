Won’t you sing to me your song
Got a short time to stay here
And a long time to be gone

I'd rather be in some dark holler
Where the sun don't never shine
Than for you to be another man’s darling
And to know you'll never be mine

Little birdie, little birdie
What makes you fly so high
When you know that my true lover
Is waiting in the sky

Little birdie, little birdie
Won’t you sing to me your song
You’ve caused me lots of trouble
What you’ve caused me too, too longYou might also like
