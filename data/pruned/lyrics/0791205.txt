When someone else has said goodbye
Somehow you only want the ones
Who only going to make you cry

It seems no matter what you do
You never get their loving affection
It should be obvious to you
You're looking in the wrong direction

What's the matter with me
What do I have to do to make you see
Just how good it could be
If it's really love that you need
What's the matter with me

When you're lying in my arms
Waiting for your heart to feel
How can you be so close to me
And not know the way I feel?

You say it makes you feel so good
To know you can cry on my shoulder
I must really be a fool to let it happen over and overYou might also like
