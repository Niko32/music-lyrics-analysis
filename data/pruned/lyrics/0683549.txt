Lately you leave me in a cold state of mind
Your goodbyes are never on time
The blues just keep coming and drying out your eyes
Don't you think I feel it too
A slow train a cold rain I'm all inside out
The lights just aren't shining on me
To live it again I'd be living a lie
Don't you think I feel it too
In a world of my own where the ground is my home
And the lights shine only from the sky
Like you like a fool I'm lost in the blues
Don't you think I feel it too

[Outro]
In a world of my own where the ground is my home...
