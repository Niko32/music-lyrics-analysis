Stay, I can't lose you, this summer
Have me as you will
Make my eyes a little wider
Your hands amaze me, still

You were lovers then, my patience is running thin
I'll never know how I lived without this love
Run your lips against everything that's holding in
All my shadows

[Chorus]
Lights and sound, please stay a little bit longer
I wanna forget these rules
Please hold my chest a little bit tighter
Bring me into your room
My heart is pulsing with every shudder
Lights and sound, please stay a little bit longer
Please stay a little bit longer

[Drop]
Please stay a little bit longer
Bring me into your room
Bring me into your room
Bring me into your room
You might also likeSound, please stay a little bit longer
Wanna forget these rules
Wanna forget these rules
Bring me into your room

Sound, please stay a little bit longer
Wanna forget these rules
Wanna forget these rules
Wanna forget these rules

Sound, please stay a little bit longer

[Verse 2]
Wait, you silence thundering thoughts, dear
Make my spirit still
Take, my heart and make it stronger
Heal my broken will
Peel back all my skin, know my spirit, know my sin
I'll never know how we stayed apart this long
Press your hips against everything that's holding in
All my shadows

[Chorus]
Lights and sound, please stay a little bit longer
I wanna forget these rules
Please hold my chest a little bit tighter
Bring me into your room
My heart is pulsing with every shudder
Lights and sound, please stay a little bit longer
Please stay a little longer
[Drop]
Please stay a little bit longer
Bring me into your room
Bring me into your room
Bring me into your room

Sound, please stay a little bit longer
Wanna forget these rules
Wanna forget these rules
Bring me into your room

Sound, please stay a little bit longer
Wanna forget these rules
Wanna forget these rules
Wanna forget these rules

Sound, please stay a little bit longer

Please stay a little bit longer
Bring me into
Bring me into
Bring me into

Sound, please stay a little bit longer

[Outro]
My heart is pulsing with every shudder
Lights and sound, please stay a little bit longer
Please stay a little longer
