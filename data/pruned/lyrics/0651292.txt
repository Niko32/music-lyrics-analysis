Days full of rain, sky's coming down again
I get so tired of these same old blues
Same old song
Baby, it won't be long before I'll be tying on
My flyin' shoes, flyin' shoes
Till I'll be tying on my flyin' shoes

[Verse 2]
Spring only sighed, summer had to be satisfied
Fall is a feeling that I just can't lose
I'd like to stay, maybe watch a winter day
Turn the green water to white and blue
Flyin' shoes, flyin' shoes
Till I'll be tying on my flyin' shoes

[Verse 3]
The mountain moon forever sets too soon
Being alone is all the hills can do
Alone and then her silver sails again
And they will follow in
Their flyin' shoes, flyin' shoes
They will follow in their flyin' shoes

[Verse 1]
Days full of rain, sky's coming down again
I get so tired of these same old blues
Same old song
Baby, it won't be long till I'll be tying on
My flying shoes, flying shoes
Till I'll be tying on my flying shoesYou might also like
