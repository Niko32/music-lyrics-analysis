Back to the rugged, back to the ratchets and muskets
These bastards are crabs in a bucket
Tracks get constructed, tight like we strapped with a budget
Magnums, cannons clutch it, hammers erupted
Cash get deducted, damagin' the structure
Marxman, C4 packets in the muffler
Panic when I puncture
Bar for bar spoken
Art of war, left you in the corridor broken
All the broads open, Vicki draws soakin'
Clear the route quickly, air him out smoke him
Appear like a omen, know your fam heard of me
Plan formed perfectly, expand foreign currency
I scan where the serpents be, men attemptin' burglary
Sent 'em to emergency, left their denim burgundy
Netherlands to Germany, weapons cause static
Flesh get torn like fabric, my essence holographic

[Chorus]
The industry investin' in artists
Excessive while the rest of 'em starvin'
I don't respect that garbage
My message is their records are horrid
They dress 'em in expensive garments
I don't respect that garbage
The industry investin' in artists
Excessive while the rest of 'em starvin'
I don't respect that garbage
I'ma rep my sector regardless
Marxman, the rest of 'em targets
You might also like[Verse 2]
I've returned from my hiatusâ€”hi haters!
Always tryin' to bother the dude like wild neighbors
Silence the traitors, fuck your disguised favors
I'm Brooklyn like bodegas and Now and Laters
Plus I want a thousand acres
You curse when you hear the growl
Peers are foul, tryin' to reverse engineer the style
Clear and loud, dispellin' the mystic
Slept with the wicked Jezebels in the district
Knelt and they kissed it
Everything exquisite from their nails to their lipstick
Tail when they visit
Hailed as a misfit, smokin' to provoke the thoughts
Focused force, and it opens like a Trojan horse
Foes get tossed, I left 'em with a swollen lip
Broken ribs, and jetted in a stolen whip
So legit, they're frauds when it's all revealed
Marxman, fuck your recording deal

[Chorus]
The industry investin' in artists
Excessive while the rest of 'em starvin'
I don't respect that garbage
My message is their records are horrid
They dress 'em in expensive garments
I don't respect that garbage
The industry investin' in artists
Excessive while the rest of 'em starvin'
I don't respect that garbage
I'ma rep my sector regardless
Marxman, the rest of 'em targets
