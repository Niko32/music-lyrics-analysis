(Love me right) Love me
(Love me right) Come on
(Love me right, love me right) You got to do it to me right

[Verse 1]
What could take the place of you?
Nothing in the whole world
You’ve been bad boy even though I’ve been a good girl
Well the point is I’m in love
And you’re not acting like you should
You have treated me so wrong
Treated me bad and that ain’t good (Come on)

[Chorus]
Love me right (love me right)
Make my body jump and shout tonight (You got to love me right)
Make me have to say “Oh me oh my” (Love me right)
You’re quite a guy (dynamite)
Love me right (love me right)
Love me right (love me right)
Take me to the highest kind of height (You got to love me right)
Give me all you’ve got and don’t be jive (Love me right)
(Fight after fight, stay tonight) Love me right

[Verse 2]
My friends can see that you are shady (Well)
You don’t treat me like a lady, uh uh (Uh uh)
I used to ignore that information, about your reputation (Bad)
But you don’t leave me much choice
It’s been so long since I heard your voice
Not another night will I let you walk leaving me to cry (Come on)
You might also like[Chorus]
Love me right (love me right)
Make my body jump and shout tonight (You got to love me right)
Make me have to say “Oh me oh my” (Love me right)
You’re quite a guy (dynamite)
Love me right (love me right)
Love me right (love me right)
Take me to the highest kind of height (You got to love me right)
Give me all you’ve got and don’t be jive (Love me right)
(Fight after fight, stay tonight) Love me right

[Bridge]
I ain’t never gonna love no one who don’t love me right
If you keep treating me wrong you don’t love me right
Don’t be jive keep love alive, come on love me right
We can start real love tonight, come on and love me right

[Outro]
(Love me right, jump and shout tonight, you got to love me right)
(Love me right, you’re quite a guy, dynamite)
(Love me right, highest kind of heights, you gotta love me right)
(Love me right, fight after fight, stay tonight)
