Oh, baby, don't you want to go
Back to the bright lights there
To my sweet home Chicago

Now one and one is two
Two and two is four
I'm heavy loaded, baby
I'm booked, I gotta go

Oh, baby, don't you want to go
To the bright lights there
To my sweet home Chicago

Two and two is four
Four and two is six
You keep fooling around baby
You gonna get in an eternal fix

Oh, baby, don't you want to go
Back to the bright lights there
To my sweet home Chicago

Four and two is six
Six and two is eight
Keep fooling around baby
Gonna make you be kinda late
You might also likeOh, baby, don't you want to go
To the bright lights there
To my sweet home Chicago

Now six and two is eight
Eight and two is ten
You tricked me one time
You sure gonna do it again

Oh, baby, don't you want to go
To the bright lights there
To my sweet home Chicago

Eight and two are ten
Ten and two are twelve
Somebody gonna wake up
In the bottom pits of hell

Oh baby, don't you want to go
Back to the land of California
To my sweet home Chicago
