Running my city ain't slowing from any we troopahs
Individuals rocking harder than any mineral
Unless you bad bitch hop off my fucking genital
Losers I run the game, king for long interval

In the race for the fame
Shave my mane away puff the K
Who you trynna shoot, I fade away

The plan in action rap for rack interaction whoever asking
I made the beat I do the rappin' and the trappin'
Fake niggas lurking better double check ya attic
Ya gotta flip it till they turn into an addict

All I wanna do is shine
Bring home the bacon
Don't over think it
But mucho niggas are trynna make it
Yet I'm the only Omar Get Em in the nation
Fuck who racing I'm still pacing
Soon they gonna see who chasing nigga patience

All of my people gon' eat
Family the priority
Driven of course
Oh so driven I floor it
Cross triple 7 you see
You might also likeWho the fuck looking at me
Who the fuck stepping to me
Yall niggas gonna regret it rehearsing your apologies
Allah see everything, never gonna kill a man


[Hook]

All I wanna do is shine, nigga
All I wanna do is shine
(All I wanna do is shine) x4

[Verse 2: A King]

Rip to the beat
Production by get em
Let me go ahead and tell them
My nigga fuck yo assumption
No need for disruption
End of discussion
Troopahs we fire flame, hot as a lava from a volcano eruption

High power society political corruption
Niggas trynna bring me down I can feel the obstruction
They gonna find ya if you wanna run and hide good luck then
Fuck them I'mma carry on with my slow death pace future
Always relying on Mary Jane I love her
She is the cure my nigga right beside me
He is my brother no undercover in the 703
No one rise above us
The fakeness in little time I discovered
Letting shit slide cuz I'm all about my money
Got stacks all about that greenery
Nigga got my rubber bands
Starting to go to school make a couple grand
Be so rich like AK you the man
My work hours depend on supply and demand
I do what I do because you'll never understand

Top of the mind I stand
Contemplating if I should jump man
Thankful for my life nigga change of plan
Pearl an L you know I can
Smoked away 5 years of my life
That's time flowing down like sand
In a hour glass that better kush in that blunt you pass
Don't underestimate me I will outlast surpass

[Hook]

All I wanna do is shine, nigga
All I wanna do is shine
(All I wanna do is shine) x
