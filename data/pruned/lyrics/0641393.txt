Im floating through space
But heaven was made for us
And i got a taste
Of everything made from us
If you need time let me know
We gone be fine just don't go
I was thinking i could give you this
This genesis

You know I love you
Baby are you really asking me?
The sun is setting in your throat
Your body's a catastrophe
But i can see a masterpiece
And i can trace the line that god has drawn to lead you back to me
I hope that Im the last for you
I hope theres no one after me
Cause we can fight til kingdom falls
And put it back together
Tell me now or never
Cause im waiting at forever
I can't live like this no more
I can't run and hide from painted lines
Theres feelings i dont show
& theres a God that I know enough to hit up on the phone
But he knows that Im old enough
To stop feeling alone
Break even with me
Don't say you leaving less you leaving with me
I need you with me
Got grief up in me
If i lose you
Or you not right here just breathing with me
Ill multiply the greatest times
Just like you breeding with me
And u was needing with me
Thats why you feasting with me
You pushed my buttons
Until you fucking found a beast within me
And when Im low you scoop me up and just start weeping with me
And thats not weakening me
Truth is thats speaking to me
You say its mirrors in my eyes
Thats how you always see the light
Thats how you always know you're mine
The stupid kids in the basement was planning retaliation
They knew they used to be naked
They knew they used to be naked
Got lost inside translation
Just needed a revelation
