Yeah
(Thank you Jesus for this song)
Hey, hey hey hey hey
Don't do it, don't do it
Don't do it, don't do it

[Chorus]
Don't go and put a bullet in your head
Just turn your life around instead
Don't go and put a bullet in your head

[Verse 1]
I'm gonna get it
But working nine to five just doesn't let it
I feel I'm wasting time and I regret it
Can't even feed my kids and my wife

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm longing to find it
A taste of the sweeter life, oh my
Only it takes a little time
(No, don't do it)

[Chorus]
Don't go and put a bullet in your head
Just turn your life around instead
Don't go and put a bullet in your head
Oh my, oh my
You might also like[Verse 2]
Ain't got no credit
Can't even pay my rent
Where will I get it?
There's a liquor store right down the block, I'll get it
Can't even feed the pain in my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm longing to find
(I'm longing to find)
A piece of the bigger pie, oh my
(A different kind)
Only it takes a little time
(A little time)
(No, don't do it)

[Chorus]
Don't go and put a bullet in your head
Just turn your life around instead
Don't go and put a bullet in your head

[Bridge]
Oh my, oh my, oh my (Ooh)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my (Ooh)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my (Ooh)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my (Ooh)
Oh my, oh my, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my (Ooh)
Oh my, oh my, yeah, yeah, yeah (Ooh)
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my (Ooh)
Oh my, oh my, you got to think bigger, baby
Sho'nuff a magic city
[Outro]
Don't go and put a bullet in your head
Just turn your life around instead
Don't go and put a bullet in your head
(Put a bullet in your head)
Oh my, oh my, oh my
(Put a bullet in your head)
Don't go and put a bullet in your head
Just turn your life around instead
Don't go and put a bullet in your head
Oh my, oh my, oh my
Don't go and put a bullet in your head
