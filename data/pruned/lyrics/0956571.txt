Into her nothing she feels and feels like motion, slow motion
Like something inside, something's broken

In sight, in mind, in body
Into this nothing, nothing
In sorrow, in pain
Into this nothing, nothing

She falls and hears, hears and screams
And hating herself, she hates her dreams
And thinks of, she thinks of... of something terrible, terrible

All in whispers, all in silence
All in secret, all when quiet
All in everything that feels
And feels to disappear
All in whispers, all in silence
All in secret, all when quiet
All in everything that screams
And makes you hurt
And takes you away

In sight...

All in whispers...You might also like
