Baby, we been knowing each other for a long long time
For something like this to just go and break up everything

[Verse 1]
Here we are, just sitting here
Knowing we're all alone
My Rollie's looking at me
Saying it's time to get it on
You know what I want
And baby, I know what you need
So stop hesitating, girl
And give your love to me

[Chorus]
All I really want is to love you, baby
Make your body feel like heaven, baby
I just wanna satisfy ya, baby
That's all I want, that's all I want
I just wanna give ya something, baby
Just wanna keep it coming, baby
I just wanna make you happy, baby
That's all I want, that's all I want

[Verse 2]
Though the fireplace is burning marshmallows just right
To who it may concern
You won't be coming home tonight
Body parts that he DON'T kiss
Girl, I will kiss for you
Just put this CD on the repeat
And let me pamper you
You might also like[Chorus]
All I really want is to love you, baby
Make your body feel like heaven, baby
I just wanna satisfy ya, baby
That's all I want, that's all I want
I just wanna give ya something, baby
Just wanna keep it coming, baby
I just wanna make you happy, baby
That's all I want, that's all I want

[Verse 3]
Now the swimming pool's out back
Come on and skinny dip, baby
Eat breakfast in the morning
That'll be complements of me
In the middle of the night
There's no need for morning here
So hold your pillow tight
'Cause I wanna do it again and again

[Chorus]
All I really want is to love you, baby
Make your body feel like heaven, baby
I just wanna satisfy ya, baby
That's all I want, that's all I want
I just wanna give ya something, baby
Just wanna keep it coming, baby
I just wanna make you happy, baby
That's all I want, that's all I want
[Bridge]
('Til the sun comes up)
Baby, we'll be making love
(And when the sun goes down)
Still we won't have enough
Take this love to you
I will take care of all you need
Baby, let's assure
I just wanna set you free, free, yeah

[Chorus]
All I really want is to love you, baby
Make your body feel like heaven, baby
I just wanna satisfy ya, baby
