He put his hand near mine and then he touched me
I felt a sudden tingle when he touched me
A sparkle, a glow

He knew it, it wasn't accidental, no, he knew it
He seemed and smiled to tell me so all through it
He knew it, I know

He's real and the world is alive and shining
I feel such a wonderful drive t'wards valentining

He touched me
I simply have to face the fact he touched me;
Control myselfand try to act as if I remember my name
'Cause he touched me, he touched me
And suddenly nothing is the same

But he touched me, he touched me
And suddenly nothing is the sameYou might also like
