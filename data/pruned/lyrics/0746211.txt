Aggravation fuelin' me
Money-powered hypocrisy
I have no feelings
You're much the same
We have no feelings
We feel no pain

[Pre-Chorus]
I am numb to all I see
This the way it has to be
Gone is hope, gone is need
I know, stone don't bleed

[Verse 2]
What's it worth
Before I die?
What's the reason
They all cry?
I have no feelings
Too much the same
Not my problems
I feel no blame

[Pre-Chorus]
We are blind and we are cold
We are 'fraid of growing old
We are numb to all we see
Nothing sacred

Backs turned to madness
Backs to misery
And I put
The brush to the canvas
And paint a world
Paint my world of hurt

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
We are blind and we are cold
Still afraid of growing old
We are numb to all we see
Nothing sacred

[Chorus]
Backs turned to madness
Backs to misery
And I see
The brush to the canvas
It paints my world
Paints my world of

Backs turned to madness
Backs to misery
And I see
The brush to the canvas
Paints a world
Paints my world of hurt
[Post-Chorus]
Paints my world of hurt
Paints my world
In my world of
In my world
In my world of hurt
Ooh, in my world of hurt

[Outro]
In my world
In my world
In my world
In my world of hurt
