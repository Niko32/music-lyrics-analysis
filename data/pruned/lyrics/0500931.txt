I just wanted to cry baby
That shit hurts to know
That you got another nigga
On ya mind baby

[Verse 1]
I got a few regrets damn baby
Shouldn't never gave you my
Heart in the first place
I can do bad by myself
Think of all the progress
We could've made
Ion give a fuck about
Nobody else but you
(Ion give a fuck, another girl like you oh baby)
Hell yeah it hurts loving someone
That dont know your worth
How could you make me an option
When I put you first
Girl, I dropped em all for you
Why would you leave me
Letting go is hard to do
You make it look easy
Done dealing with this love
Shit again I won't give none and
I won't take none in
You might also like[Chorus]
You put something on me so cold
We should've been what we could've been
Now my heart is broke
And if I had the chance to do it over again
Then maybe I could show you exactly
What we could've been
When ya cut me so deep
I just wanted to cry baby
(What type of shit he got you on baby)
That shit hurts to know that ya
Got another nigga on ya mind baby
(where the fuck did we go wrong)

[Verse 2]
How could you leave when you got
My heart tucked away
And I still love you that'll never fade away
But I wish in my heart that it would change
Damn, all I think about is what we could've been
All I think about is what we should've been
Now I'm on the outside looking in
Damn, baby won't cha give a nigga chance girl
Yeah we should of stuck to the plan girl
You was suppose to be my only number one fan girl
But shit it all changed in the end
Man I swear I can't be ya friend
Do I ever cross ya mind girl I wonder
Trynna hold back from dialing yo number
Yeah and I wish we never let go
Cause that feeling you gave me was always special true shit
True shit now I'm feeling clueless
Cupid hit me in the heart
And baby you put it on me
[Chorus]
You put something on me so cold
We should've been what we could've been
Now my heart is broke
And if I had the chance to do it over again
Then maybe I could show you exactly
What we could've been
(All I need is one more chance)
When ya cut me so deep
I just wanted to cry baby
(What type of shit he got you on baby)
That shit hurts to know that ya
Got another nigga on ya mind baby
(where the fuck did we go wrong)
