I'm gonna join the Baptist church
I'm gonna get me some religion
I'm gonna join the Baptist church
Gonna be a preacher
So I don't have to work

I wish I had a heaven
A heaven of my own
I wish I had a heaven
A heaven of my own
Give all of my women
A long and happy home

I'm gonna preach these blues
I'm gonna pick my seat and sit down
I'm gonna preach these blues
I'm gonna pick my seat and sit down
'Cause when the spirit comes
Lord knows I'm gonna watch it too

Grabbed up my suitcase
And took off down the road
Grabbed up my suitcase
And took off down the road
I said farewell my church
May the good Lord bless your soul
Bless your soul
Bless your soul
Bless your soul
Bless your soulYou might also like
