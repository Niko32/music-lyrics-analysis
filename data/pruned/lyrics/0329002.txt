Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah!

[Verse 1: Brian & Nick]
You had me waiting
Even on a second date
I picked you up
I took you to your favorite place
I saw you flirting
But I looked the other way
Away, away, away, hey!
You pulled me up
And said you had a place to go
Just grab my keys
You took my car and stole my phone
I knew I shouldn't
But I let you get away
Away, away, away

[Chorus: All & AJ]
But I'm not a player, I'm not a clown
I won't be a puppet just hanging around
You need another man
To put diamonds on your hands
And let you take his car
I found out who you are
I finally figured you out! (oh-no)
You might also like[Verse 2: AJ]
I should've seen it coming
You were just pretend
Used up my credit card
And maxed it 'til the end
I wish I'd known
Before I hit the ATM
Oh-no, it happened again
Hey-yeah-hey-ah!

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
'Cause I'm not a player, I'm not a clown
I won't be a puppet just hanging around
You need another man
To put diamonds on your hands
And let you take his car
I found out who you are
I finally figured (I figured you out)
I finally figured (I figured you out)
I finally figured (oh yeah!) you out!

[Bridge: All & Howie]
I'm going away, far, far away
I'm going away, so far away
I'm going away, far, far away
I'm gonna pack your bags and kick you out
I'm sorry but I figured you out
[Interlude: AJ & Nick]
Figured you out, hey!
So long, so long, farewell

[Chorus: All, Brian & AJ]
'Cause I'm not a player, I'm not a clown
(I won't be a puppet)
I won't be a puppet just hanging around
You need another man
To put diamonds on your hands
(Diamonds on your hands)
And let you take his car
I found out who you are
'Cause I'm not a player, I'm not a clown
(Player, hey-ah!)
I won't be a puppet just hanging around
You need another man
To put diamonds on your hands
And let you take his car
I found out who you are
I finally figured (I figured you out)
I finally figured (I figured you out)
I finally figured (oh yeah!) you out!
