If you want me to love you, I will
I don't want to seem forward
To love you would be such a thrill

And the time that we spend together
So soon could be gone
And I know if we don't love together
I'll just love you alone

I know you don't know me
I know we just got here, but still
I just want you to know
If you want me to love you, I willYou might also like
