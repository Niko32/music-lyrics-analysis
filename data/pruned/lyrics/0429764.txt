Front porch sitting in an old rocking chair
The sun is hot in the Texas sky
Garden growing clothes out on the line
Dusty road when a car goes by
Story telling of days long ago
And the only place she'd ever been
Singing softly This World Is Not My Home
Memories take me back again

[Chorus]
When I was young and Grandma wasn't old
When she guided me as I watched life unfold
Anything we didn't have we didn't really need to hold
When I was young and Grandma wasn't old

[Verse 2]
She'd throw a party and all of her friends
Would gather around the quilting frames
They'd always call out for me to come inside
And give me nickels and dimes to sing
It makes me happy that I can still go back
My memories are so clear
Of how It used to be when I never dreamed
Of ever looking back from here
You might also like[Chorus]

[Outro]
When I was young and Grandma wasn't old
