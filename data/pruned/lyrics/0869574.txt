This street we walk upon
This corner full of piss and fear
This street won't bear it long
It slants, it tilts, it's brought outside
Alive

[Chorus]
Cover your face when you walk by
Drench your visions in darkness
Spit up blood when you cough
Cool, cool, cool, cough, cool, cool, cool
We dine on visions with new eyes
Creep, creep, creep, creep
We cut our visions with two eyes
Cool, cool, cool, cool

[Verse]
This street we walk upon
This corner full of fear
This street we walk upon
This corner full of piss and fearYou might also like
