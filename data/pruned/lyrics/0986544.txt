It's not the end
We're gonna postpone it
Put it off again

Our separate paths will lead us
Different ways
But the care remains
It will always stay

Yesterday's not all that bad
Sorry I could not make this last
Yesterday's not all we have
Sorry I could not make this last

One thing I need from you
That's honesty
Please never lie to me
That's what she said to me

One thing for sure is that
I will be true
In everything I do
That's what I've learned from you

Yesterday's not all that bad
Sorry I could not make this last
Yesterday's not all we have
Sorry I could not make this last
