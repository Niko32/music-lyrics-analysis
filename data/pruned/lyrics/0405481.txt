Saturday night and I'm all alone
Don't have a date, I'm just sitting home
The radio's playing the tap tunes tonight

[Chorus]
Play me a sad song (oh yes)
Please mister deejay (yes)
Play me a sad song tonight (ooh-ooh)

[Verse 2]
Don't you think I want to go where other kids go
Don't you know I want to do what other kids do
I've got nobody to hold me tight (ooh yes)

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Don't want to hear a lullaby
I can't sleep, I just sit and cry
Play me a sad song, a song of love
Because that's all that I'm thinking of
Sitting here crying won't get me the girl
I bet I'm the loneliest boy in the world
Oh what's the use, guess I'll turn off the light (ooh yes)
