I've had to think up a way to survive
Since you said it's over, told me goodbye
I just can't make it one day without you
Unless I pretend that the opposite's true

[Chorus]
Rivers flow backwards
Valleys are high
Mountains are level
Truth is alive
I'm perfectly fine
And I don't miss you
The sky is green
And the grass is blue

[Verse 2]
How much can a heart and a troubled mind take
Where is that fine line before it all breaks?
Can one in their sorrow, just cross over it
And into that realm of insanity's bliss?

[Chorus]
There's snow in the tropics
There's ice on the sun
It's hot in the Arctic
And crying is fun
And I'm happy now
And I'm glad we're through
And the sky is green
And the grass is blue
And the rivers flow backwards
And my tears are dry
Swans hate the water
And eagles can't fly
But I'm alright now
Now that I'm over you
And the sky is green
And the grass is blue
You might also like[Outro]
And I don't love you
And the grass is blue
