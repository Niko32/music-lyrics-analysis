Nature's reign is ending
Children unattended
Freeze
Beyond the trees
The world is so much colder
Dreams turn into soldiers
And bleed

The earth is turning
Kings are burning
The missions down
To the ground
As time passes
Cold bastards
Frighten me
Beyond the trees

Beyond the trees
Beauty's lost in boundary
Insanity surrounds me
Here

Beyond the trees
If there is disaster
Is there something after
For me

Kings are burnin'
The missions down
To the ground
As time passes
Cold bastards
Frighten me
Beyond the trees
