I've been throwing horseshoes over my left shoulder
I've spent most all my life searching for that four leaf clover
Yet you run with me chasing my rainbows
Honey, I love you too, that's the way love goes

[Chorus]
That's the way love goes, babe, that's the music God made
For the whole wide world to sing, it never gets old, it only grows
Losing makes me sorry, you say, "Honey don't worry"
Honey, I love you too, that's the way love goes

[Outro]
Honey, I love you too, that's the way love goesYou might also like
