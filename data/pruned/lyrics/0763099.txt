Another weak day comes along
And all my righteousness goes wrong
But I was doing so well
My dreams to be a Godly man
Seem out of reach of my own hand
But where I fall short, His grace still stands
If I have faith like a child

And if Monday's child is fair of face
And Tuesday's child is full of grace
Then you can call me a Tuesday's child
Like Wednesday's child, I'm full of woe
And Thursday's child I've got far to go
But you can call me a Tuesday's child

Sounds too easy some might say
There's a bigger price to pay
But when Jesus gave His life away
It was once and for all
So, with more of His grace filling me
I more than ever want to be
Growing up in purity
With the faith of a child

And if Monday's child is fair of face
And Tuesday's child is full of grace
Then you can call me a Tuesday's child
Like Wednesday's child, I'm full of woe
And Thursday's child I've got far to go
But you can call me a Tuesday's child
You might also likeTuesday's child
That's what I want to be
Tuesday's child
Full of His grace for me
Tuesday's child
Knowing He's all I need
Tuesday's child

And if Monday's child is fair of face
And Tuesday's child is full of grace
Then you can call me a Tuesday's child
Like Wednesday's child, I'm full of woe
And Thursday's child I've got far to go
But you can call me a Tuesday's child

Tuesday's child
That's what I want to be
Tuesday's child
Full of His grace for me
Tuesday's child
Knowing He's all I need
Tuesday's child
Growing in purity

Tuesday's child
Sharing the grace He gives
Tuesday's child
That's how I want to live
Tuesday's child
Free in His promises
Tuesday's child
I want to be a Tuesday's child, yeah...
