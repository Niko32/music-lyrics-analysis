New sensation

[Verse 1]
Check out this groove
Are you walking on air?
Going into a new dimension, yeah
So put your vibes on my beat
And we'll lay it down like that
Slap the hi-hat in, put the fairlight on the track

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can get
Crazy like that, feel it like that
Move it like that, drop it like that
Rocking the track, I'm looking for that new sensation

[Chorus]
Woo hoo
I think we're on to something
You're taste it mirrors mine
So hot and in the moment
Let's make this demo right
Or I might just lose it when we make sweet music

No feather beds, no exotic affair
Got samples and scratches
Let's do it, right here
Boys and girls, a different kind of sound
'Cause every heartbeat, babe
Is the soundtrack to your life, oh
And every mad effect must be sent to get me high

[Pre-Chorus]
And we can get
Crazy like that, feel it like that
Move it like that, drop it like that
Rocking the track, I'm looking for that new sensation

[Chorus]
Woo hoo
I think we're on to something
You're taste it mirrors mine
So hot and in the moment
Let's make this demo right
Or I might just lose it when we make sweet music
When we make sweet music
When we make sweet music
When we make sweet music
When we make sweet music
I think we're on to something
You're taste it mirrors mine
So hot and in the moment
