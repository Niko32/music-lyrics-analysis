[Verse 1: Beezy]


Uh.Peep what I say. The sun is set like clock work, now put that clock to work
Cause time waits for no man. You feel me?
Still they cover read us every now and then
Download our songs they head spin. Ha..
Clearly was unexpected. Check it
I grab the microphone and wreck it
I'm.. destined to live this dream for all my peeps who never made it
Word to the homie "homie chase your dreams dont let'em chase ya"
So can I kick it with winners and losers?
Gun Shooters and Drug abusers?
If they with it, then I'm down for whatever under the sun
Bring more than one
Misses on your way through
We can met up in the basement. Face it
Yeah..


[Verse 2: Ricks]

Clearly. Me and the homie smoke mad buddha
Accused of being abusive. Found Guilty
Sentenced life behind bars through our music
F A Rap crtic they losers. Not trying to play us
If im assuming well I would say they hating
Or cover reading the name andâ€¦
Or maybe they thinking we some jerk niggas with a one hit looking to get paid
I speak for all of us we want to get paid
But we will be paid by our passion
Instead getting on the tracks in trash rap
Just something I had to get from the bottom of my heart
Follow your heart thats a start
To the life you dreamed of when you was a boy or a little girl
You know the world is yoursYou might also like
