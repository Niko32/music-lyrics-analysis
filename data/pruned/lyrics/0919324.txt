Am I speaking Japanese? I told you 20 times when neat but you still don't get it
It doesn't mean that I'm not sad
But I know what we had went bad and you still--you don't get it

[Chorus]
Hello hello hello I'm saying
Goodbye goodbye goodbye but your Staying I know I know I know
You've been hoping
I promise my doors not open
Hello hello hello I'm saying
Goodbye goodbye goodbye but your staying I know I know I know
You've been waiting
Hello Goodbye nothings changing

[Verse 2]
Showing up outside my house and Coming over unanounced man
You are so crazy and then
You try to beg my brain
The information is the same
You and I don't belong where this fight now is wrong
And if you feel I've led you on
YOU MISREAD IT

[Chorus]
Hello hello hello I'm saying
Goodbye goodbye goodbye but your Staying I know I know I know
You've been hoping
I promise my doors not open
Hello hello hello I'm saying
Goodbye goodbye goodbye but your Staying I know I know I know
You've been waiting
Hello Goodbye nothings changing
You might also like[Bridge]
Yeah I'm sorry we don't feel the same
I don't wanna hurt you
I just want you to go awaaaaayy

[Music instrumental]

[Chorus]
Hello hello hello I'm saying
Goodbye goodbye goodbye but your Staying I know I know I know
You've been hoping
I promise my doors not open
Hello hello hello I'm saying
Goodbye goodbye goodbye but your Staying I know I know I know
You've been waiting
Hello Goodbye nothings changing

Hello hello hello
Hello hello hello
Hello hello hello
