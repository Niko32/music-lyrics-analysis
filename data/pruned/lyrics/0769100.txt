Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Oh yeah yeah, yeah yeah (Whoa, whoa)
Ooh, ooh, whoa, baby (Whoa, whoa, whoa)

[Verse 1]
I'm not gonna say a word
To make your walk out the door
And I'll never break your heart
Or make you not love me more, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
We fit so good together
Everyone says they've never seen better, babe
We got the world in our hands
You're my lover and my best friend

[Chorus]
And we are a family
You are my everything
We are a family (Whoa, whoa)
You and me and baby makes three (Whoa, whoa)
We are a family (Family)
You are my everything (You and me)
We are family (Family)
You and me and baby makes three (You and me)

Tell me, baby, I'll fix it, boo
I wanna be your perfect man

[Pre-Chorus]
The way that we laugh together
The way you dress, missy - try this sweater, babe
We've got the world tonight
Waking up next to you feels so right

[Chorus]
And we are a family
You are my everything
We are a family (Whoa, whoa)
You and me and baby makes three (Whoa, whoa)
We are a family (Family)
You are my everything (You and me)
We are family (Family)
You and me and baby makes three (You and me), woo, oh
