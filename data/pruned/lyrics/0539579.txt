You ain't leaving, no, wait and hold up
You can't leave, nah, I thought we were up
My envisionment was wrong, was it the future?
Hence we talked about it too much and it ruptured
It's you I think about when my day rains hard
When I'm stuck at work and I'm playing with a card
I'm shouting, and I'm screaming but it's all fake
Snapback, hoody on, welcome to the show, shake
My voice, it's shaking, I can't do this anymore
Drop the mic, turn around and look into my eyes
Can't see you I need you? Doesn't matter, cries
It's all I feel, my lips bubbling, my throat gulps
Fuck, please stop this, please don't let me cry
Try, lie, I don't care, please don't let me die
If you knew, would you tell me you were attached again
Tell me you love me more and not give up till you won

[Hook: Anna Hughes]
Don't walk away, I need you more each day
The times that we had, got lost in the past
Forever in time, you know that you'll be mine
And baby if you knew, would it be me and you

[Bridge: Anna Hughes]
At night when I dream, all that I see
Is me and you, me and you

If you knew would you give me a second chance?
If you knew would you give me a second glance?
I miss waking up to you, smiling, play fighting
No lighting, no argumentative fighting
I miss the little things that we used to do
Ain't done none of the things that we used to do
Why? Cause it hurts, cause I see your voodoo doll
I keep getting random heartaches, is that you again?
Hitting me with pain? Smashing down all the rain
Not letting me let go cause you still love me?
It's just a thought, I need you to see me free
Although no girl could ever compare right to you
I've gotta live and learn to live without you
My thoughts are cloudy and I can't surpass them
Like the Jedi not sensing the dark side around them
Stupid example, but I need to know if you knew

[Hook: Anna Hughes]
Don't walk away, I need you more each day
The times that we had, got lost in the past
Forever in time, you know that you'll be mine
And baby if you knew, would it be me and you
