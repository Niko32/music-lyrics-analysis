I knew a boy who would not share his bike
Oh, but he let me go sailing
I swore that I could survive any storm
Oh, then he let me go

[Pre-Chorus]
"Can you launch rockets from here?"
Boy, I've done it for years
Right over my head
And when I promised my hand
He promised me back
Snow cherries from France

[Chorus]
All that summer, we travelled the world
Never leaving his own back garden
Girls, I didn't know just what it could be
Oh, but he let me go sailing

[Verse 2]
You question me, "Can you ride anything?"
Lord, do you mean like your mood swings?
Invaders and traders with the best intentions
May convince you to go
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
"They look like pirates from here"
Boy, I've been one for years
Just keeping my head
And when I promised my hand
You promised me back
Snow cherries from France

[Chorus]
All that summer, we travelled the world
Never leaving his own back garden
Girls, I didn't know just what it could be
Oh, but he let me go sailing

[Outro]
And then one day he said, "Girl it's been nice
Oh, but I have to go sailing"
With cinnamon lips that did not match his eyes
Oh, then he let me go
