To tears in four years
It's strange, we're all home
But Elle's gone and I feel so alone

The fashion industry calls
Inquisitive minds need to know
Now you live 3000 miles away
And a camera full of pictures of you
Is all that I have to show

Your bags are packed
I can see it now
Waiting at terminal 5
This plane will bore you away
Thank god that you
Heard my last call

The fashion industry calls
Inquisitive minds need to know
Now you live 3000 miles away
And a camera full of pictures of you
Is all that I have to show

It's cold enough to die today
I think it's cold enough to die today
Your picture finds its way to my hand
Every fucking time I look at the clockYou might also like
