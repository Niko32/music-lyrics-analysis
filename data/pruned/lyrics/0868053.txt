You led the way for me
In my indecision
You lit the darkest night
Just to give me vision

[Pre-Chorus: Dionne Warwick]
You are the one who I could run to any time and many times
You take my hand and you understand
When friends of mine I cannot find

[Chorus: Dionne Warwick & Smokey Robinson]
You're my hero
How can I thank you for what you've done?
Said I was zero
Now I feel like I'm number one

[Verse 2: Smokey Robinson]
What made me realize
There's nothing you can't see
You looked at me with eyes
That saw what I could be

[Pre-Chorus: Smokey Robinson]
Somehow with you I'm able to do
What I couldn't do on my own
You're all I need to know that I'm freed
From all my fears of the unknown
You might also like[Bridge: Dionne Warwick & Both]
There were mountains to climb and some of those times
My strength was fading fast
For me you stood when nobody else would
You saved my future and me from my past

[Chorus: Dionne Warwick & Smokey Robinson]
You're my hero
How can I thank you for what you've done?
I was zero
Now I feel like I'm number one

[Break]

[Bridge: Smokey Robinson + Dionne Warwick + Both]
When I didn't know which way to go
You showed me in the right direction
And you rescued me from what I could not see
And you're always there for my protection

[Chorus: Dionne Warwick & Smokey Robinson]
You're my hero
How can I thank you for what you've done?
I was zero
Now I feel like I'm number one
Said you're my hero
How can I thank you for what you've done?
I was zero
Now I feel like I'm number one
Said you're my hero
How can I thank you for what you've done?
