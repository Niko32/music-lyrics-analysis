The lights were hot and the beer was not
And the band was playin' loud
The house was full
But her eyes pulled me right across the crowd
And I said how's a guy like me get to know you
She said not so fast, let me show you

[Chorus]
She said the first step is the two-step
I'm here to dance and nothing more
Swing me 'round that hardwood floor
If you want to run with me, crawl before you walk
The first step is the two-step then we'll talk

[Verse 2]
We sang along with every song
And the room was spinnin 'round
We danced in line, she felt so fine
And we hardly hit the ground
So I said maybe we could make a reservation
For some wine with candlelight and conversation

[Chorus]
She said the first step is the two-step
I'm here to dance and nothing more
Swing me 'round that hardwood floor
If you want to run with me, crawl before you walk
The first step is the two-step then we'll talk
First things first, let's two-step then we'll talkYou might also like
