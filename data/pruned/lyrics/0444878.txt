Looking back over my cold shoulder
Little girl stepping down to the river
You call for me but I do not answer

In a daze, I was walking away
Losing memories of love and laughter
I was fading into the darkness
It was me but there was no likeness

Emily, Emily, Emily, Emily
It was just a bad dream, just a bad dream

I had a dream, I was going away
Looking back, I could see you dreaming too
Sleep-walking down by the river
I called your name but you did not answer me

And I did not answer you
You did not answer me
And I did not answer you

Emily, Emily

I woke up in the middle of the night
I took you in my arms and held you tightly
You were cold and shivering all over
I woke you up, baby, what's the matter
You might also likeYou were trapped in a terrible dream
You were drowning in ice cold water
I was gone, I was far away
But you could hear me calling out your name

Emily, Emily, Emily, Emily, Emily
It was just a bad dream, just a bad dream

You had a dream, I was going away
Looking back, you could see me dreaming too
Sleep-walking down by the river
You called my name but I did not answer you

And you did not answer me
I did not answer you
And you did not answer me
I did not answer you

Emily, Emily

Emily, Emily, Emily, Emily
Emily, Emily, Emily, Emily
Emily, Emily, Emily, Emily
Emily, Emily, Emily, Emily
