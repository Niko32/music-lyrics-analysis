The lion's just like me
He's a twin and I was a twin
Although, his twin grew up
So I must join the stage of awful singles ventilating
We head up to Vermont for a couple days

[Chorus]
You say the name of a state when horror's underway
So you might escape back to the place where horror stays away
Still, you might escape

[Verse 2]
Me, I'm just like my wife
She's a blade and I'm a dull knife
Turned up in a bouquet
And we get red for days
Soaking through our silk and unbathed
We head up to Vermont

[Bridge]
And I don't know whose call it was that I should share a life
With someone who resembles me and copies my speech
Down to every lisp and slur I practiced to put on
It's hard to keep a dialect when you keep changing where you come from
You might also like[Chorus]
And that's a place where horrors fade away
So you might escape back to a place where horrors fade away
Still, you might escape to the place when horror's underway
Still, you might escape back to a place where horror stays away
Still, you might escape

[Outro]
Guess I could just get set up with someone's got my given name
