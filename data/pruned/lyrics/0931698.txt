So amazing she
Got some sort of a spell on me
And all I can do is seem to please
I do anything she ask of me (Ask of me, yeah)

[Refrain]
Ooh, you are making me believe that you're my, you're my girl
It's something I've been looking for in my, in my world
Do everything to me my lady, and I'm, and I'm yours
And I'm, and I'm yours
And I gotta let you know that

[Pre-Chorus]
When I'm around you (I never grow cold)
And what we got girl (It never go old)
And just like music (We hit every note, every note, every note)
Every time you leave me (Me wanting more)
Of what you give me (I never get bored)
'Cause what we got, girl (It never go old, never go, never go, never go old)

[Chorus]
Turn it up, yeah
You set my soul on fire
Turn it up, yeah
My needs are getting dire
Turn it up, yeah
And we've set [?] alarm off
Turn it up, turn it up, yeah
