And I'mma bang it like this
Mister

[Hook]
With my hands in my pockets
And I'm moving forward forward forward forward
You put a bad taste in my mouth, mister
(Keep outta my way, mister)
With my hands in my pockets
And I'm moving forward forward forward forward
You put a bad taste in my mouth, mister
(Keep outta my way, mister)

[Verse 1]
Who said all the rules are made with rulers
We break 'em and break in their computers
I ain't buying no more from them looters
Who tried to out-school us, so we jump on our scooters
I hope you understood us, when we say
We don't make that money on the violence
That's why we don't do the silence
We don't make that money on the violence
That's why we don't do the silence

[Bridge]
Do you know me, punk?
I do you punk!
Do you know me, punk?
I do you punk!

(Keep outta my way, mister)
With my hands in my pockets
And I'm moving forward forward forward forward
You put a bad taste in my mouth, mister
(Keep outta my way, mister)
With my hands in my pockets
And I'm moving forward forward forward forward
You put a bad taste in my mouth, mister
(Keep outta my way, mister)
With my hands in my pockets
And I'm moving forward forward forward forward
You put a bad taste in my mouth, mister

[Verse 2]
They say I pick big battles with the government
Immigration departments
For the people who live in the tenements
Our voices carry our sentiments
We sprinkle your coffee with the cinnamon
We're made of ladies and gentlemen
From the street to the spidermans
We could take on all your nation
