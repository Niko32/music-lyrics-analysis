I walk this earth alone
With broken bones
I fear no evil
Evil fucking fears me
Your time has come
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
I am the shadowed one

[Refrain]
Evil fucking fears me
Evil fucking fears me

[Chorus]
I am refined in the fire
From the furnace, I emerge casted in steel
I am refined in the fire
From the flames, we march on to victory

[Refrain]
Ooh...
Evil fucking fears me
Evil fucking fears me

[Verse 1]
I am refined in the fire
I am the weapon of choice for the warrior king
Recognize, I'm refined in the fire
You'll see the dragon tremble at the song we sing
I am refined in the fire
And will his kingdom fall? Know that time will tell
Recognize, I'm refined in the fire
Under the blood, I stand to bring war
Bring war on hell
You might also like[Bridge]
I represent the army of the shadowed realm
I am a soldier for the damned
The broken
You will know me from my path of destruction
I write to you from hell

Forward, ooh!
Forward, ooh!
Forward, ooh!

[Verse 2]
You want a war?
You'll get a war
I was trained with pain, hate, and agony
Desensitized from this fucked world around me
I'm going out, and I'm taking you with me

[Intro Reprise]
I walk this earth alone
With broken bones
I fear no evil
Evil fucking fears me
Your time has come
Looking down the barrel of a smoking gun
I am the shadowed one
[Outro]
Evil fucking fears me
Evil fucking fears me
Evil fucking fears me
Ooh! Evil fucking fears me
