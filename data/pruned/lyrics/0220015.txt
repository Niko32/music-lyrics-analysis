Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone, alone will tell

[Verse 1]
When I was just a little boy, only six years old
I asked my daddy what big things my future hold
He said, "Son, when you grow up to be a man
The facts of life you will start to understand
Nobody knows just what tomorrow may bring
So I wanna tell you now, and listen while I sing"

[Chorus]
Papa said
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone, alone will tell

[Verse 2]
Now I'm a lonely man trying to make life on my own
Ever since the day I was born, I never had a happy home
Just like the river, I've been running ever since
The day I was born in that broken-down little town
I'm wondering now just what my end will be
'Cause it seems to me, happiness I'll never see (Never see)

[Chorus]
Mama said
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone, alone will tell

Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone, alone will tell

[Verse 3]
Time keeps on changing like the weather and the season
For every mistake, Mama said, there must be a reason
After a storm, there's got to be a calm
So I think I'll wait a while
And try to wear a smile (Wear a smile)

[Chorus]
Mama said
Time will tell, time will tell
Time alone, alone will tell

What he say now?
(Time will tell) I know, I know
(Time will tell) Said, I know
(Time alone, alone will tell)

One more time now
(Time will tell) I believe
(Time will tell) Oh, yes, I do
(Time alone, alone will tell) I believe right now
One more time now
(Time will tell) Said, I know
(Time will tell)
