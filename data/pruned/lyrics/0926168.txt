See the way that she's watching you
Victims falling before her
And there's nothing that you can do

Love comes, holding on to us all
Love comes, holding on to us all

See the hard hearted woman
Watch the way that she's dancing now
Eyes are flashing before you
Break her spell, please tell me how

Love comes, holding on to us all
Love comes, holding on to us all

See the way that she's watching now
Break her spell, please tell me how

Love comes, hoding on to us all
Love comes, hoding on to us allYou might also like
