I don't wanna spend another lonely night
Ooh
[Verse 1]
I've got the lights turned up
The door is locked
The bedroom TV's on
Doin' the only thing that gets me through the night
Since you've been gone
[Chorus]
Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)
[Verse 2]
I made a bad miscalculation
Bettin' you would never leave
'Cause if you're gettin' on with your new life
Then where does that leave me?
[Chorus]
Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight

Hoping that I didn't wait too long (I didn't wait too long)
That this is just the dark before the dawn
[Verse 3]
Deep in my heart, I know that you love me as much as I love you
(You know I love you, girl)
And that you must be lyin' somewhere, looking up to heaven too

[Chorus]
Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
(Make me spend another lonely night)
Prayin' for daylight, waiting for that morning sun
So I can act like my whole life ain't goin' wrong
Baby, come back to me, I swear I'll make it right
Don't make me spend another lonely night
(Don't make me spend another lonely night)
Prayin' for daylight (Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight

[Outro]
I don't wanna spend another lonely night
I don't wanna spend another lonely night (Prayin' for daylight)
Prayin' for daylight
I don't wanna spend another lonely night
Ooh
Prayin' for daylight
