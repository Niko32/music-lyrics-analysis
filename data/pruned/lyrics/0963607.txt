Cause I like to get low down
All of you mothers better lock up your daughters
Cause the boogie man's in town

Call me the boogie man
Nobody can do it like I can
They call me the boogie man
I'm a king size boogie man

The sheriff had got my number
He locked me up last fall
I taught her daughter how to do the boogie
Now I can't go back at all

They call me the boogie man
Nobody can do it like I can
They call me the boogie man
I'm a king size boogie man

I used to be with a travelling band
Down on the county line
I went down there to do some boogie
And I wound up down in town

They call me the boogie man
Nobody can do it like I can
They call me the boogie man
I'm a king size boogie man
You might also likeI tell all you good time women
And you never thought some .......
Just a little taste of my good boogie
Will make you climb the wall

They call me the boogie man
Nobody can do it like I can
They call me the boogie man
I'm a king size boogie man

I'm a king size boogie man
I'm a king size boogie man
I'm a king size boogie man
