E-yeah!

[Verse 1: TRapztar7]

My girl she a baller
She like Jordan
Every move that she makes
Got the whole world movin'
Got 'em movin'
Got 'em movin' her way
She is my baby
I love her
That ain't gonna change
No matter what you
Mu'fuckers
Have to say to me
I drop the beat and
She move to it
Ain't used to it
Could get used to it
And she own this shit
Fuck all the other bitches
I love this chick
I wanna feel your lips
Go!

You're the one that I gotta ahve to succed
When I first saw you
I knew it was real
I'm sorry 'bout the pain that he made you feel
Girl that were'nt me

I'm looking for the sun
But it's raining today
Let me put arms around ya
Make you feel OK
You a baller, girl
