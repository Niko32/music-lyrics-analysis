I've never seen a diamond in the flesh
I cut my teeth on wedding rings in the movies
And I'm not proud of my address
In the torn up town, no post code envy

[Pre-Chorus: Youth In Revolt]
But every song's like, gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like, Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus: Youth In Revolt]
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler), you can call me King T
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

[Verse 2: Youth In Revolt]
My friends and I we've cracked the code
We count our dollars on the train to the party
And everyone who knows us knows
That we're fine with this, we didn't come from money
[Pre-Chorus: Youth In Revolt]
But every song's like, gold teeth, Grey Goose, trippin' in the bathroom
Blood stains, ball gowns, trashin' the hotel room
We don't care, we're driving Cadillacs in our dreams
But everybody's like, Cristal, Maybach, diamonds on your timepiece
Jet planes, islands, tigers on a gold leash
We don't care, we aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus: Youth In Revolt]
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood
That kind of luxe just ain't for us
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler), you can call me King T
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy

[Bridge: Youth In Revolt]
Oooh ooooh ohhh
We're bigger than we ever dreamed
And I'm in love with being king
Yeah!
Life is great without a care
We aren't caught up in your love affair

[Chorus: Youth In Revolt]
And we'll never be royals (royals)
It don't run in our blood (It don't run in our blood)
That kind of luxe just ain't for us (luxe just ain't for us)
We crave a different kind of buzz
Let me be your ruler (ruler), you can call me King T
And baby I'll rule (I'll rule I'll rule I'll rule)
Let me live that fantasy yeahYou might also like
