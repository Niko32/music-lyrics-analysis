With cheating another, I have cheated myself
I feel so incited That it's come down to this
This is how I repair the hurt that I have caused
I offer my hand
As an equal, as a friend

Tonight, it is a reunion
And we've forgotten every day that we shed
When we dismissed each other
In claiming that we shared in separate victories
Tonight is all that we have
It's all we've lived and it is all the we'll face
And in one way or another
We all know that our days are new
Our days are new as I offer my hand
As an equal, as a friend

I hope that people see
What this all means to me
Confidence (confidence) in my actions
With a positive regard for others
And I know that respect paves a clear path
For success, valor, and camaraderie
It's a vision of progression
It's a vision

Please don't shoot the piano player
He's doing the best he can
Let us live by one rule:
Respect us, we'll respect you
