Gonna stay out of New York
There's something there that gets me crazy
No, I won't go back
There's something there that bleeds me dry
It gets so bad that I stop breathing
And then the sun don't wanna shine

[Verse 2]
Well, there's something wrong with New York
It's a prison without walls
I won't set foot there
I just don't like that place at all
Now you might call it sophistication
But I say time is running out

[Verse 3]
I say I won't go back to New York
There's a darkness all around
No, I just can't handle it
You know that place is getting me down
Now you might say it's sophistication
But I say time is running outYou might also like
