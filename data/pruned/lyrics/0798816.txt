The entire Empire State
It couldn't hold me back
'Cause I was driving away
From the faces that I couldn't even place

[Chorus]
And that's alright and that's okay by me
And that's alright and that's okay  by me
I've got a couple of books on tape and a fresh pack of cigarettes

[Verse 2]
And if I think too much
The words seem to disappear
So I'll take you up on a ferris wheel
I simply grab your hand

[Chorus]
And that's alright and that's okay  by me
And that's alright and that's okay by me
I've got a couple of books on tape and a fresh pack of cigarettes

[Outro]
And I've quit over twenty times and I guess I'll have to do it againYou might also like
