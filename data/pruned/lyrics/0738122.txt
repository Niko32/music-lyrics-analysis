Boy you should already know
I would do any and everything
Any and everything for you

Promise you it ain't even a question
Promise you, you got my word, got my word, you do
Promise you it ain't even a question
Promise you, you got my word, got my word, you do

[Hook]
Whenever I say
You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
Think I'd leave you down when your down on your knees
Must be crazy what you're thinking
Don't you even pay attention to me
You don't see, you don't see

[Verse 2]
I would never leave you
Wouldn't leave you down when you're down on your knees
I will always keep you here with me
Do you even know what you mean to me, to me
Boy you should already know
You are the sun in my galaxy
You are beyond my control
