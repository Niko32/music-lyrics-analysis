Oh, it's easy to find someone to play with
And almost anyone will do to fill your idle time
But that really special someone you can
Share all your dreams with, is so hard to find, oh yeah
And it used to be like me to settle for the physical
But these days, it ain't too easy to make up my mind
'Cause apparently the body's just too temporary
To take up my precious time, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got to know that
That I can be free with you
And you gotta show that
That you're worthy of my time
You can stimulate my mind

[Chorus]
I know that it looks good, but
Can you be a part of my life?
I'm sure that it feels good, but
Can you be a part of my life?
And it probably tastes good, but
Can you be a part of my life? I've got to know

[Verse 2]
I still appreciate the beauty of a woman
But there's more to what I need now than what meets the eye
And if beauty's only skin deep
Then your pretty skin won't send me to the highest high
Oh, it's been a long time, comin' for maturity
And I believe that it's truly what it has to be
'Cause as much as I admire you
My sexual desire ain't controlling me, oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
See I gotta know that, yeah, yeah
That I can be free with you
And you gotta show that
That you're worthy of my time
You can stimulate my mind

[Chorus]
I know that it looks good, but
Can you be a part of my life?
And I'm sure that it feels good, but
Can you be a part of my life?
And it probably tastes good, but
Can you be a part of my life? I've got to know
One more time, hey, hey
I know that it looks good, but
Can you be a part of my life?
I'm sure that it feels good, but
Can you be a part of my life
And it probably tastes good, but
Can you be a part of my life?
I've got to know, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Outro]
Can you be a part of my life?
I've got to know that
Can you be a part of my life?
I've got to know that
Can you be a part of my life?
I've got to know that
Can you be a part of my life?
I've got to know that
Can you be a part of my life?
(Can you be a part of my life?)
(I've got to know that)
Can you be a part of my life?
(Can you be a part of my life?)
(I've got to know that)
[Skit]
What up, Marky Mark?
Yeah, man, headed out to the studio right now
Let me get this last one done, it's a wrap
I'm headed out right now, I'm puttin' my guitar in the trunk right now
I'll be there in like 15 minutes
Alright then, peace
