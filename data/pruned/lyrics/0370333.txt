Don't fight what you're feeling now
It's only right (It's only right)
We're gonna have one hell of a night
Don't deny what you're feeling inside
Just relax have a good time

[Verse 1: Lorine Chia]
Take this time with me, let's go out to see
What the night wants us to be, let's break out and be free
So many places to go, I wanna go where the wind will blow
Let go of all you're thinking of
And let the magic of the night unfold

[Chorus: Lorine Chia]
Don't fight what you're feeling now
It's only right (It's only right)
We're gonna have one hell of a night
Don't deny what you're feeling inside
Just relax have a good time

[Post-Chorus: Lorine Chia]
And have a good time
And have a good time
And have a good time
Just relax have a good time
You might also like[Refrain: Lorine Chia]
Put your hands up in the air, and have a good time
Wave em like you just don't care, and have a good time
Take a round with all your friends, and have a good time
Feeling like this never ends, and have a good time

[Verse 2: Machine Gun Kelly]
And they say, "Girls ain't nothing but trouble"
But I say, "Go ahead and bring me a double", courvoisier
You already know what we up to
I'm trying to change the world with one drink mufucka
Uh, East side for life (Yeah), I'm bringing up my hood, you're right
Hit 120 in the fast lane but with G double Od Good on the turnpike
Yeah, now bounce like it's your night, uh
Bounce, bounce like it's your night
Living like were gonna die today, one hit of me take the pain away
And we come through like angels say, "praise God"
My thought so hard I could fade away
And in this game it's safe to say, "Stay real keep the fake away"
That's how I play, Kells

[Chorus: Lorine Chia]
Don't fight what you're feeling now
It's only right (It's only right)
We're gonna have one hell of a night
Don't deny what you're feeling inside
Just relax have a good time
[Post-Chorus: Lorine Chia]
And have a good time
And have a good time
And have a good time
Just relax have a good time

[Refrain: Lorine Chia]
Put-Put your hands up in the air, and have a good time
Wave 'em like you just don't care, and have a good time
Take-Take a round with all your friends, and have a good time
Fe-Feeling like this never ends, and have a good time

[Outro]
And have a good time
