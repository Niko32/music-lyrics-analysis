You don't remember me
Oh, but I remember you
Was not so long ago
You broke my heart in two

[Chorus]
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you

[Verse 2]
If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate

[Chorus]
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you

[Verse 3]
Love is not a gadget
Love is not a toy
When you find the one you love
You fill your heart with joy
If we could start anew
I wouldn't hesitate
I'd gladly take you back
And tempt the hand of fate
You might also like[Chorus]
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you

[Chorus]
Tears on my pillow
Pain in my heart
Caused by you

[Outro]
You, you, you
