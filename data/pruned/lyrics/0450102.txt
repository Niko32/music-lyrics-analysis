To know, know, know him is to love, love, love him
Just to see that smile, makes my life worthwhile
To know, know, know him is to love, love, love him
And I do

[Verse]
I'll be good to him, I'll bring joy to him
Everyone says there'll come a day when I'll walk alongside of him
To know, know, know him is to love, love, love him
And I do, I do, I do

[Bridge]
Why can't he see, how blind can he be
Someday he'll see that he was meant for me
