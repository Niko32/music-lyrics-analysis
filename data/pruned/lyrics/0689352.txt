Sitting here in L.A., looking down at my shoes
Drowning my troubles on small talk & blues
Sitting here wondering if I could have been born to lose
I think moving is losing and now I can see
I let a false hearted woman make a fool out of me
And now all I got left now is a bad case of Birmingham Blues

[Chorus]
Days are all right
I can't take these, L.A. nights
This place is a jungle when a man's on his own
I wish I could go home

[Verse 2]
Had me a fine woman down in Birmingham town
Took care of my money and she didn't play around
All I got left now is a bad case of Birmingham Blues

[Chorus]
