'Mid the green fields of Virginny, dear, I met you
Where the roses red and white around us grew
When I held you in my arms and gently kissed you
The robin sang the sweetest song he knew

[Chorus]
I'm longing for old Virginia
For old Virginia and you
And I'm hoping the soul within you
Is longing for me, too
To Virginia, just like an eye beam
My heart flames ever true
And I reckon in the spring I'll bring a little ring
To old Virginia and you

[Verse 2]
Though tonight I'm far from you in old Virginia
I love you as I did that day in June
And when springtime comes again to old Virginia
I'll build a little cottage just for two
