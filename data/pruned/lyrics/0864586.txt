I'm up against some kind of wall
To come to terms with the fact that I'm just an animal
You've captured me and confronted me
Put me out of my misery
Tortured me til' I gladly agree on anything at all
My heart oh my heart﻿ oh my heart is bursting at the seams
From all of the beauty discarded in search for love supreme
And night after night realizing it's cursed
To live by my recurring dream
A new dream rudely wakes me and begs me to hold on. Let go
I'm alive. [x6]
Here I am, your own prison guard
The road ahead will be just as hard
And I am aware that you've already run a marathon
I bullied you and belittled you
And out of love I have hitherto
Held you under my thumb to discern whose side you're really on
My heart oh my heart﻿ oh my heart is bursting at the seams
From all of the beauty discarded in search for love supreme
And night after night realizing it's cursed
To live by my recurring dream
A new dream rudely wakes﻿ me and begs me to hold on. Let go
I'm alive. [x11]
Broken and burglarized. But you keep beating as long as you can
Drunk and de-virginized. You still have faith in a master plan
Trembling and traumatized. But you keep running as fast as you can
Vulgar and victimized. But you believe in a promised landYou might also like
