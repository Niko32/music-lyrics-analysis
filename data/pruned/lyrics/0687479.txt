All I wanna know
Is when you go
Do you think of me?
'Cause I could let you go
But there'd be a hole
Where my heart used to be

[Chorus: Sheryl Crow & Don Henley]
It's so easy holding you near
I could melt in your arms and disappear
Loving you, baby, is breaking my heart tonight
'Cause it's so easy, but it isn't right

[Verse 2: Don Henley]
I saw you today
You walked away
And I couldn't breathe
'Cause I know how it would feel
A love so real
When you're touching me, ooh

[Chorus: Sheryl Crow & Don Henley]
It's so easy holding you near
I could melt in your arms and disappear
Loving you, baby, is breaking my heart tonight
'Cause it's so easy, but it isn't right
You might also like[Bridge: Sheryl Crow & Don Henley]
Every night I lie here alone
After you leave me and go home
She doesn't know that we can't let go
And it's hurting me so

[Chorus: Sheryl Crow & Don Henley, Sheryl Crow]
It's so easy holding you near
I could melt in your arms and disappear
Loving you, baby, is breaking my heart tonight
'Cause it's so easy, but it isn't right
It's so easy, but it isn't right, no
It's so easy, but it isn't right

[Outro: Sheryl Crow & Don Henley]
Baby, it's so easy
