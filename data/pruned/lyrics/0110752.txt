[Verse 1: Nicholas]
Headline: "Murder, young girl killed
Desperate shooting at Echo's hill
Dreadful ending, killer died
Evidently suicide"

A witness heard a horrifying sound
He ran to find a woman dead and
Lying on the ground

[Verse 2: Nicholas]
Standing by her was a man!
Nervous, shaking, gun in hand
Witness says he tried to help
But he'd turned the weapon on himself!

His body fell across that poor young girl
After shouting out in vain
The witness ran to call for assistance
A sad close to a broken love affair!

[Chorus 1: Nicholas]
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

She wanted love forever
But he had another plan
He fell into an evil way, she had to let him down
She said, "I can't love a wayward man."

She may have found a reason to forgive, oh yeah, yeah
If he had only tried to change
Was their fatal meeting prearranged?

[Verse 4: Nicholas]
Had a violent struggle taken place?
There was every sign that lead there!
Witness found a switchblade on the ground
Was the victim unaware?

They continued to investigate
They found a note in the killer's pocket
It could have been a suicide letter
Maybe he had lost her love

"I feel there's only one thing left to do!
I'd sooner take my life away than live with losing you!"

[Chorus 2: Nicholas]
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are
All that we learn this time (What we have been is what we are)
Is carried beyond this life
All that we learn this time (What we have been is what we are)
Is carried beyond this life

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 3: Nicholas]
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are
Our deeds have traveled far
What we have been is what we are

All that we learn this time (What we have been is what we are)
Is carried beyond this life
All that we learn this time (What we have been is what we are)
Is carried beyond this life
