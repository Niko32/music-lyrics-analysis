You can 'rest everybody but cruel Stack O' Lee
That bad man, oh, cruel Stack O' Lee

Billy de Lyon told Stack O' Lee, "Please don't take my life
I got two little babies, and a darlin' lovin' wife"
That bad man, oh, cruel Stack O' Lee

"What I care about you little babies, your darlin' lovin' wife?
You done stole my Stetson hat, I'm bound to take your life"
That bad man, oh, cruel Stack O' Lee

[Humming]

Boom boom, boom boom, with the forty-four
When I spied Billy de Lyon, he was lyin' down on the floor
That bad man, oh, cruel Stack O' Lee

"Gentleman's of the jury, what do you think of that?
Stack O' Lee killed Billy de Lyon about a five-dollar Stetson hat"
That bad man, oh, cruel Stack O' Lee

Standing on the gallows, head way up high
At twelve o'clock they killed him, they's all glad to see him die
That bad man, oh, cruel Stack O' LeeYou might also like
