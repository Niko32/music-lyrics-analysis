Uh
Yeah

[Verse 1: Domo Genesis]
I let you niggas have your fifteen, but I'm runnin' next
Don't duck and run, I'm crushin' this, son, just fuck 'em and nothin' less
Used to hustle suckers for pack of Gushers and dubs of cess
And now I puff some pounds every month, I don't be fuckin' stressin'
It ain't no need to up and flex
You guide it 'til there's nothin' left
Showing no contestin', I'm just laughin' at who I'm up against
Bunch of frail fucks, bitches with they tails tucked
Hope you ain't thinkin' we believin' the things you tell us
Hope you ain't thinkin' 'bout some beefin' 'cause that's an L, bruh
Wolf Gang comin' with that pack like a mail truck
Niggas can not stop me, Doms drops kamikaze
Outloud the chop to the top notch and got it bodied
Smoother than Maserati, not in the novice lobby
Nigga watch me droppin' that constant shit that you gotta copy
Show me that shit you be on, I already got it, probably
Nigga hella cocky on my hustle, don't you fuckin' knock me

[Chorus: Domo Genesis]
Apply pressure from all angles
To go against it is dangerous
Maintain' cause it ain't no thing to us
You niggas claimin' that famous stuff
We just stayin' the same, stackin' papers 'til the angels come
'Plyin' pressures from all angles
To go against it is dangerous
Maintain 'cause it ain't no thing to us
You niggas claimin' that famous stuff
We just stayin' the same, stackin' papers 'til the angels come

Ain't no lovin', just a thug with multiple drug habits
Rippin' wheels on automobiles with this automatic
Record label drop me, I drop the package to my niggas
Slept on some couches, chop some ounces, now I'm even richer
Straight water-whipper, that gangsta nigga, gangsta Gibbs
Under surveillance, got federal agents at the crib
Them crackers say I'm movin' thangs on airplanes
So spare me with the threats, I shot my lawyers some spare change
Them G packs, back on the streets, jack
Back in the spot, got geekers smokin' off their kneecaps
Turnin' rookies into regulars, cook that relapse
I got them yappas, bigger choppers than the police got
And them niggas know it, bigger shit I'm flowin'
I know they gon' get me one day early in the mornin'
So when I wake up I praise the Lord, roll up a blunt and fuck my bitch
Make that ass get up and whip it, turkey bacon, eggs and grits
Gangsta Gibbs
Uh, uh, yeah
Make that ass get up and whip it, turkey bacon, eggs and grits
Smokin' dolo 'cause some cholos just got smoked over some bricks
Flirt with death just like the west, I might do life 'cause life's a bitch, Gangsta Gibbs

[Chorus: Domo Genesis]
Apply pressure from all angles
To go against it is dangerous
Maintain 'cause it ain't no thing to us
You niggas claimin' that famous stuff
We just stayin' the same, stacking papers 'til the angels come
'Plying pressures from all angles
To go against it is dangerous
Maintain 'cause it ain't no thing to us
You niggas claimin' that famous stuff
We just stayin' the same, stackin' papers 'til the angels come
[Verse 3: Prodigy]
Baby girl tweakin' on that moon rock
Me? I just keep it simple, let the dome pop
You let the champagne splash on the girl's head
It ain't a party 'til some champagne glass break
Gettin' that stupid dough, spittin' that future flow
Grand Puba bars, the infamous large
This is how I do it, get this money, live large
My haters know to stay away from me, I fire arms
Thugged-out Hippy, super dope with a rap sheet
From the ceiling to the floor, all kind of charge
Counts of robbery, assaults and battery
I'm just a felon with a talent for spillin'
This Dog-Back-Alley shit over these good beats
The police, my enemies, they all wanna goal me
Straight to the pound box, straight up
I will curl a nigga body up then peel off in a hot wheel
I thought I told you, these niggas never listen
I popped a Desert Eagle off and make ya bitch pissin'
Side of your car, I'm tryin' to relax
But you push me to the limit, I'ma take it to the max

[Chorus: Domo Genesis]
Apply pressure from all angles
To go against it is dangerous
Maintain 'cause it ain't no thing to us
You niggas claimin' that famous stuff
We just stayin' the same, stackin' papers 'til the angels come
'Plying pressures from all angles
To go against it is dangerous
Maintain 'cause it ain't no thing to us
You niggas claimin' that famous stuff
We just stayin' the same, stackin' papers 'til the angels come
