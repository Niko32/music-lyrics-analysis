Keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man
Don't sit around gossiping
Explaining what your good man really can do
Some women nowadays
Lord they ain't no good
They will laugh in your face
Then try to steal your man from you
Women be wise
Keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man

Your best girlfriend
She might be a highbrow
She changes clothes 3 times a day
What do you think she's doing now
While you're so far away
She's loving your man in your own damn bed
You better call for the doctor, mama
Try to investigate your head
Women be wise, keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man

Women be wise, keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man
Don't sit around, girl
Telling all your secrets
Telling all those good things he really can do
If you talk about your baby
You tell me he's so fine
Lord honey
I just might sneek up and try to make him mine
Women be wise
Keep your mouth shut
Don't advertise your man
You might also likeDon't be no fool
Don't advertise your man (baby don't do it)
