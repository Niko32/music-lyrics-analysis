You, I know you're everything
That I've been looking for
And I, I look into your eyes
And could not ask for more

[Pre-Chorus: Anne Murray]
So it's only fair to lay it on the line
Hold on, I'm gonna need a little time

[Chorus: Kenny Rogers, Anne Murray, Both]
But if I ever fall in love again
Sometimes when this broken heart can mend
I know it's gonna be with you (it's gonna be with you)
You're the one to pull me through
Though I don't know when
If I ever fall in love again

[Verse 2: Anne Murray]
Scared, I guess I'm scared to fly
It's such a long way down
And yet, if you'd just trust in me
I'm sure, I'd come around

[Pre-Chorus: Kenny Rogers, Anne Murray, Both]
And I know when you're hurt
It's hard to let someone inside (oh, woh)
In your arms I feel I'm ready now to try
Ohh wooh

So if I ever fall in love again
Sometimes when this broken heart can mend
I know it's gonna be with you (it's gonna be with you)
You're the one to pull me through
Though I don't know when
If I ever fall in love again

[Bridge: Anne Murray with Kenny Rogers]
I'd be a fool to ever let you go
You're the best thing in my life
When I know I gotta take it slow

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus: Kenny Rogers, Anne Murray, Both]
Oh, I know it's gonna be with you (it's gonna be with you)
You're the one to pull me through
Though I don't know when
If I ever fall in love again

[Outro: Kenny Rogers & Anne Murray]
If I ever fall in love again
