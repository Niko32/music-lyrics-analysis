Well, I saw you today and I thought for a while I was dreaming
You were the loveliest girl I'd seen in a long, long time
You introduced me to him and while we were talking
I just stood there thinking you never looked that good when you were mine
(Patti)
It was all I could do to hide all the things I was feeling
Lord, just lookin' at you sent chills up and down my spine
I wanted so much to reach and touch you but I just stood there dyin'
You never looked that good when you were mine
(George Talking)
You know hunny, I've wondered so many times if you still stayed
Out late the way we used to do. With all of our old friends
The jukebox and all that wine
(Patti)
Oh, maybe you just stay at home lovin' one another
(Both)
'Cause you never looked that good when you were mine
(Patti)
Oh, if I knew then what I know now we'd still be together
(Both)
'Cause you never looked that good when you were mine...You might also like
