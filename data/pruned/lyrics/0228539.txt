And she told me that your new love went astray
Now isn't that just the way I said it would be
Come on back home what's bad for you is good for me
It's good for me to have this chance to win your love again
It's bad for you to lose his love but this is not the end
Still lets pretend to move along that used to be
Come on back home what's bad for you is good for me
--- Instrumental ---
I knew if I'd wait long enough someday he'd set you free
He'd find someone to take your place like he took you from me
And now you know just how it feels in misery
Come on back home what's bad for you is good for me...You might also like
