Helping the world is a goal, but without you I’d be too lonely
It’s too empty, this world, as they say you get that one somebody
And honestly honey, I think we may have found something
You’re fresh to death, since the day we met
Keeping me hanging off your minty breath; and the cute way that you dress
We’re not very decisive, nothing is ever decided
We just live life and the shit that we tend to do is priceless
You’re the finest thing, I’ve had the pleasure of holding
You’re the greatest person, I’ve had the patients of knowing
Sometimes we get jealous, but nothing we do is controlling
You’ve taken all of my heart, but baby it’s not stolen
I’ll keep us rolling, I tell you facts, no hiding
Behind these contacts, I got no time, for lying
There’s nothing you lack, I’m falling, so call me
It’s a bit late to confess this, so I’ll text you in the morning

(Chorus) I’m love sick and you’re my remedy
I’m fucked up and you’re my therapy
I’ll hit the notes if you’re the melody
I’m in too deep, you’ve taken over me X2

(Verse) When I lay next to you, I know you’re the one to protect
I never did expect someone like you, just so, perfect
When I reflect on my mistakes, there’s only one empty space
I haven’t fucked shit up with you, and I never intend too
You keep me grounded; I’m at my best when you are near
You’ll stick around, is all I ever need to hear
When times get hard I think of you and there’s nothing to fear
It’s profound the effect love has when it surrounds you here
Nothing is better than being considered your company;
You could never say “I love you baby” subtly
Cause when I have it, it reminds me I’m somebody
And I’ll give you all my love and care abundantly
Suddenly shits moving so quick, my heart starts to pound, I hope that you stick, by my side, no jumping this ship, my heart strings flex, don’t let them rip, give me the time, to make you mine, just give me a sign, you’ll be at my side, just hold on tight. Cause we’re bound to fly
You might also like(Chorus) I’m love sick and you’re my remedy
I’m fucked up and you’re my therapy
I’ll hit the notes if you’re the melody
I’m in too deep, you’ve taken over me X2

(Bridge) I’d work a nine to five, if that’s what it took to survive
With you, with you
I’m always down to ride, if you need some love tonight
I’m with you, with you
