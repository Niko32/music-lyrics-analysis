Angels and devils share the same tables
And that's not so wrong if you get it done right
Halos and horns lock up on the dance floor
On a honky tonk Saturday night

[Chorus]
It's a honky tonk Saturday night
It's not who is who, it's who will or who might
With luck she'll turn on 'fore they turn out the lights
On a honky tonk Saturday night

[Verse 2]
I played the jukebox, I played some Merle Haggard
Me and the waitress think he's outta' sight
Then some folks got thirsty while we were dancing
On a honky tonk Saturday night

[Chorus]
It's a honky tonk Saturday night
It's not who is who, it's who will or who might
With luck she'll turn on 'fore they turn out the lights
On a honky tonk Saturday night

With luck, I'll take her home 'fore they turn out the lights
On a honky tonk Saturday nightYou might also like
