Nigga, you betta drink half a gallon of Shaolin
Before you pluck the strings of my violin
My life is orchestrated like London Symphony, concentrated
Niggas waited and waited, I'm birthday wishes, belated
Blow out the candles, I wait in the darkness, like a vandal
The silhouette of set in this mirror on the mantle
Fireplace is in the heart, water places the art
'Round the island of desiring where most primitives stalk
Sacrificing their daughters, these primordial waters
Carry a feminine agenda that no man ever taught us
True, they captured and caught us - transported, sold us, and bought us
Constituted and lawed us, distorted truths that they taught us
We rebelled, then they fought us - we conformed, then they formed us
Now y'all niggas rhyming 'bout material possessions
My Adidas are 3 years old, like my daughter
Niggas rhyme 'bout Alize and need to rhyme about water
But out of chaos comes order, out of chaos comes order
Out of chaos comes order, out of chaos comes order
Out of chaos comes order, out of chaos comes order
Out of chaos comes order, fake niggas run for the border

(Chorus)
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la

In a past life, I was a woodcarver's knife
The sharpened blade of a woodcutter
The eldest son of the chief's brother
A maker of drums
We scraped the inside of goat hides
To seek the hollows where sound resides
Offering the parts we did not use
To invoke the muse
Music of the ghettos, the cosmos
The negroes, the necros
Overcomers of death, disciples of breath
Dissection of drumbeats like Osiris by Seth
Breakbeats into fourteen pieces
Dissemble chaos, organized noise
A patchwork of heartbeats to resurrect
True b-boys - be men!
Let's mend the broken heart of Isis
Age of Aquarius, Mother Nature is furious
While you rhyme about being hardcore
Be heartcore - what is it that we do art for?
Metaphor, medicine
It's an age of healing, why not rhyme about what you're feeling?
Or not be felt, deal with the cards you're dealt
Calling all tarot readers and sparrow feeders
To cancel the Apocalypse!
Metaphorically speaking
