Slowly shifting down

Last call is over
The sign is turned around
The chairs are on the tables
The drinks are on the house
The talk is on the level
The truth is coming out

Lonesome hounds
Hanginround
In the after hours
Slowly shifting down

Misery loves company
No need to hurry home
'Cause we're all in this together
We are all in this alone

Lonesome hounds
Hanginround
In the after hours
