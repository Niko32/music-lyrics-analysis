Oh, oh
Love makes no promises

[Verse 1]
If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love?

[Pre-Chorus]
How, tell me, how will I know?
Will my heart make me believe it so?
Or can I trust the way I feel?
If you could read my mind (If you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew)
You'd see how hard I've tried (If you only knew, if you only knew)
Still, I can't decide

[Chorus]
If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love?
Oh, tell me, could this be love?
El amor no hace promesas

Do you know if it's true?
That real love lasts a lifetime
Does it shine like the stars up in the sky?
And do you know (Do you know) if you can fall for just a moment?
Is a moment for all time?

[Pre-Chorus]
Why? Why am I so unsure?
Is that love knocking at my door?
Or the sound of my beating heart?
If you could read my mind (If you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew, if you only knew)
You'd know I just can't hide (If you only knew, if you only knew)
What I feel inside

[Chorus]
If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love?
Oh, tell me, could this be love?
Could this be love?

[Outro]
(Baby, if you only knew, knew what I've been going through)
Could this be love? I wanna know
(Baby, if you only knew, knew what I've been going through)
I wanna know
(Baby, if you only knew, knew what I've been going through)
El amor no hace promesas
(Baby, if you only knew, knew what I've been going through)
If you only knew
(Baby, if you only knew, knew what I've been going through)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
(Baby, if you only knew, knew what I've been going through)
Love makes no promises
(Baby, if you only knew, knew what I've been going through)
