It's 2 a.m. and I'm makin' love (I can't hear) to a memory (Thank you)
The sound of your footsteps towards my bed ring in my ears
I wait, you called my name
The smell of your days work and your aftershave
Your smile, your smile keeps me holdin' on, on
It's 3 a.m. and I'm holdin' on to what used to be
Your fingers ticklin' my palm, tellin' me, "Yes, please"
The arch of your back, the stickiness of your nectar
The shiver through our bodies when we arrive together

[Chorus]
I'm still holdin' on, I'm still holdin' on
I'm stillâ€”

[Verse 2]
It's 5 o'clock (4 o'clock) in the morning
I feel so weak
Thoughts of you are draining me
It's 5 o'clock in the morning
Lord, I wish You were with me
But you're gone, you're gone
You're gone, you're gone
I know I must sleepYou might also like
