Prostitution ainâ€™t right, Stripper-ella

[Verse 1]
Seh she flirt wid her boyfriend's bredren
Him have money and bling, suh she go bed wid him
Ketch disease, now it started spreading
She start to seek penicillin, she's dying
"Mercy please!", her life she begging
When she hear-suh to da morgue she heading
Seh, she bruk out at di age of seven
Strip dancing before she reach eleven

One man can't satisfy her
She needs more wood for the fire
Sex price getting higher

House, car, and land she desire
Suh from di prostitution wuk, she won't retire
Flames and fire
Sun is cool, burn di flesh seller and da buyer
