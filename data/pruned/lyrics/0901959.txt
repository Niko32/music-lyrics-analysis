To the ground
When there's no more room in Hell
The dead will walk the earth

And it shall be
As with the people
So with the priests;
As with the slave
So with his master;
As with the maid
So with her mistress;
As with the buyer
So with the seller

Arise, shine; for our time has come
For behold, Darkness shall cover the earth
In that day the dead shall hear
The words of a book
And out of their Gloom and Darkness
The eyes of the blind shall see

Rise from the depths of The Pit
To the ground
When there's no more room in Hell
The dead will walk the earth

Neither are your ways my ways
For as the heavens are higher than the earth
So are my ways higher than yours

Do not come near me, for I am set apart from you

And it shall be
As with the people
So with the priests;
As with the slave
So with his master;
As with the maid
So with her mistress;
As with the buyer
So with the seller

Arise, shine; for our time has come
For behold, Darkness shall cover the earth
In that day the dead shall hear
The words of a book
And out of their Gloom and Darkness
The eyes of the blind shall see

For my thoughts are not your thoughts
Neither are your ways my ways
For as the heavens are higher than the earth
So are my ways higher than yours...
Do not come near me, for I am set apart from you

Rise from the depths of The Pit
To the ground
When there's no more room in Hell
The dead will walk the earth
