My love
I'll never find the words
My love
To tell you how I feel
My love
Mere words could not explain

[Verse 2]
Precious love
You held my life within your hands
Created everything I am
Taught me how to live again

[Pre Chorus]
Only you
Came when I needed a friend
Believed in me through thick and thin
This song is for you
Filled with gratitude and love

[Chorus]
God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For god bless me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new
You might also like[Verse 3]
My love
Whenever I was insecure
You built me up and make me sure
You gave my pride that to me

[Verse 4]
Precious friend
With you I'll always have a friend
Your someone who I can depend
To walk a path that sometimes bends

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Without you
Life has no meaning or rhyme
Like notes to a song out of time
How can I repay you for having faith in me

[Chorus]
God bless you
You make me feel brand new
For God blessed me with you
You make me feel brand new
I sing this song 'cause you
Make me feel brand new
