With an aching in my head
I've only come to realise that everything you ever said
Made me feel like I was tied to every little whim or need
Of your obscurity

I fell asleep
Down on my knees
Staring at lives
Lived on my TV
Time was speeding up
Spinning round and round
It never matters more
Than when you're running out

So I say members of the jury
Don't you think I'm being fair
When all those late nights seem to run in orbit around me
Turning into a career
Even talking to you feels like wasting time I could have used
Why don't you sympathise with the accused?

I fell asleep
Down on my knees
Staring at lives
Lived on my TV
Time was speeding up
Spinning round and round
It never matters more
Than when you're running out
You might also likeAnd if you're looking at it
It's almost automatic
But every turn you take
Is everything you make
And don't forget you're tired
Your credit card's expired
And when you want something
It never comes around

It never saw you coming
The words are busy running
It isn't really fair
Your life is living you're not there
It's time to show you
The land of milk and honey
I just don't really say
That everything will be okay

I fell asleep
Down on my knees
Staring at lives
Lived on my TV
It isn't fair
Your life is living you're not there
It's time to show you
The land I'm not here
I fell asleep
Down on my knees
Staring at lives
Lived on my TV
Time was speeding up
Spinning round and round and round
