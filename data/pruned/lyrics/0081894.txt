I be going for broke I be going for broke
Getting low on my doe cause I be paying my dues
Now I got nowhere to go I got nowhere to go
So I’m going for broke cause I got nothing to lose

[Verse One: Iron Solomon]
To put my pen in the business I need a better incentive
Because the loans from these labels just ain't be getting my interest
And all my dead broke friends got their chedda invested
So for the Benjamin Franklins we all be getting inventive
I put the perfect punctuation at the end of each sentence
So if I think it I say it and if said it I meant it
I like stretchin' out the boundaries and testin' the limits
I might make ignorant music but bury messages in it
This is the style I use to battle with and everyone bit it
And you can hear it in their patterns though they’ll never admit it
But it really doesn’t matter I'll reinvent in a minute
To make it new and improve it so keep it fresh and authentic
See I be learnin, watchin' legends how the veterans did this
So now I'm grownin' up to show em there’s no better apprentice
I’ve traveled way too far to ever measure the distance
They call me God MC can I get me a witness

[Hook: Iron Solomon]
I let em know (let em know)
Let em know (let em know)
Tell a friend tell a foe let em know (let em know)
Get a grip (get a grip) or let it go (let it go)
Tell a friend tell a foe let em know

I got nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
I got nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
I got nothing to lose (nothing to lose)
I got nothing to lose

[Verse Two: Iron Solomon]
They call me General Solomon all the people enlisted
I’m breakin' free of the system I put my keys in ignition
I hit the road and start movin' cause I’m so eager and driven
That I’ll be showin' and provin' instead of dreamin' and wishin'
I know the shoes I’m pursuin'  in it ain't that easy to fill 'em
But still I’m one step away from havin' completed the mission
I knew the path I was taken would put my feet in position
Since I was kickin my mama from in the fetal position
So now I’m healin the children like I’m a pediatrician
Injecting truth in my music and we don’t need a prescription
So when I’m talking they’re watching and when I’m speakin they listen
They’ll see that my vision is everything the media's isn’t
Because I’m cookin' up food for thought and I’m feedin' em wisdom
So if you’re hungry for knowledge come take a seat in my kitchen
I’m like Mohammed to Muslims I’m like Jesus to Christians
I’m like Moses in Egypt but I ain't preaching religion

[Hook]
[Bridge]
I be going for broke I be going for broke
Getting low on my do cause I be paying my dues
Now I got nowhere to go I got nowhere to go
So I’m going for broke cause I got nothing to lose

[Outro]
I got nothing to lose (go go go go go go go)
