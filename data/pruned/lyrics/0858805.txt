You thought a blanket of silence would strengthen your feet
Then a name came out in prophecy
Still, you were terrified that name was truth
It's truth

Brother, you must find which way to go
And with grace be bold
Take your time
Take your time
And with grace be bold

Despite truth, the talk was cheap
You thought a princess with purpose was all that you'd need
Then a name came out in prophecy
He knew that growing fire
It came from you
Yes, you

Brother, you must find which way to go
And with grace be bold
Take your time
Take your time
And with grace be bold

The clouds will come but they're not gonna stop this love
The clouds will come
You might also likeNow a hole would be something
No, I was still nothing
No

Brother, you must find which way to go
And with grace be bold
Just take your time
Take your time
And with grace be bold

The clouds will come but they're not gonna stop this love
The clouds will come
