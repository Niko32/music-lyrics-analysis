Break me free, there is no return
It's the start of my rebirth

Andy
But as I glow just like a firefly
Time creates a vortex ride

Elize
Let it out of my sanity
It's a source of my serenity

Andy
I'm half the man I used to be
I still resent its insanity

Elize/Jake:
Walking in circles as I open up my eyes

Andy:
It's like I never stop and then wake up

Elize/Jake
So wake me up to an everlasting afterlife
It is designed from the secrets I hide
So set me free and this time you'll be electrified
The future leaves nothing behind, it's my afterlife
You might also likeJake
Hear me scream, I break the seal
An impulse of me revived

Andy
And as I fill my lungs, it's hard to breathe
Like I was born inside a dream

Elize
Welcome home, you are not alone
And no longer on your own

Andy
I'm half the man I used to be
A second life infesting me

Elize/Jake:
Walking in circles as I open up my eyes

Andy:
It's like I never stop and then wake up

Elize/Jake
So wake me up to an everlasting afterlife
It is designed from the secrets I hide
So set me free and this time you'll be electrified
The future leaves nothing behind, it's my afterlife
(It's my afterlife)

Andy
As I wake up, they're dissecting me
Can't see, can't breathe, in this reality
Synthetic Christ machine
I'm forced to live with abnormality

Elize/Jake:
Walking in circles as I open up my eyes
Andy: It's like I never stop and then wake up

Elize/Jake
So wake me up to an everlasting afterlife
It is designed from the secrets I hide
So set me free and this time you'll be electrified
The future leaves nothing behind, it's my afterlife
