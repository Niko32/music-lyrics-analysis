I, memorize your special code
I can get in anytime I want
You, say I'm just a bit too bold
Know you want it tell me you don't
Girl, what's your problem
I think you know good and well
Ain't nobody stroke it like me
Girl, I'm your problem
Made you set that bar high as hell
I ain't what you want, but I'm what you need

[Hook]
Ain't nobody do it better
And you know it, you do
Can't nodody get it wetter
Say you know it, it's true
Cause I love
Sex with... my ex... girlfriend
(I... I love)
Sex with... my ex... girlfriend

[Verse 2]
I... really like the way you go
Begging me to not kiss right there
And you, suddenly just lose control
Begging me to smack it and pull your hair
Babe, I understand you got a new man
(Telling me that you're in love, okay)
Oh, girl that's your thing
Long as you understand I get mine anytime
Night and through the day
You might also like[Hook]
Ain't nobody do it better
And you know it, you do
Can't nodody get it wetter
Say you know it, it's true
Cause I love
Sex with... my ex... girlfriend
(I... I love)
Sex with... my ex... girlfriend

[Bridge]
Can't nobody do it like I do it and you know it
One thing that it's always gon' be true is
What's mine is always mine

[Outro]
And you know it, you do
Say you know it, it's true
(I... I love)
Sex with... my ex... girlfriend
(I... I love)
Sex with... my ex... girlfriend
