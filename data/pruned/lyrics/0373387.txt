Yo shouts to Mac Miller cuz you know
Y-you know what I'm sayin'?
It's Kev Bars...representin' Triple 4 crew
Southside Williamsburg - Williamsburg Houses
JGI Entertainment
Where the fuck is Samson..right now? (laugh)
TRIPLE 4 AGAIN
My whole family nigga - Yo Ashley what's good son?!
I love you
This nigga Daniel out in Cali and shit!

[Verse: Kev Bars]

They said I wouldn't touch a college step...is they still right?
Make spills, stay ill, but future days still bright
Hate-filled labels couldn't cut dude like cable service
Flavor - major waves of fakers killed the art, it's nature, purpose
Still they reversin' - I'm fightin' for the stick shift
Not neutral dipshit, don't get your blinged wrist split
Dead King's rising sayin' this kid's the Misfit
Words so absurd from the 33rd District
Never blurtin' to those curvy, dirty birdies
Sure as Jersey that them loose nookies got the scurvy
And I can Vitamin C the shit before my graduation but now
The opposite of chillaxin' - attractin' hate and
Barely I'm havin' cake ignore faggot intimidation from lames
Who always run with a party - sans invitations
Who quick to raise a fist cuz they couldn't grace a debate
To this spittin' glitch in the Matrix, mind free like them Masons
Call this my dissertation - I demonstrate for my peers
They imitate what they hear so they indicate what they wear
I look Derelicte - how I mitigate through the years?
In this chair, let the weed smoke dissipate through the air
Prodigious this old kid is so vicious
As an infant had a lathered mouth full of soap in it
I'm hatin' all this bullshit with a chrome finish
Cheatin' money meant for real talent and gettin' no penance

[Hook: Kev Bars]

No matter where life goes now, bullshit will occur
But I won't bitch out and try to live it as a blur
Never thought it would feel this real
Have you scrapin' from meal to meal (hey, hey)
And I ain't gonna change for nothin' cuz this just who I am (who I am)
Unmeasure endeavors
So I treat it like my first day ever (my first day ever)
