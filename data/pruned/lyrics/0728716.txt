I finally saw you when I opened up my eyes
A brilliant glimpse of beauty I cannot describe
Now I’m alive!

[Chorus]
How can I deny? It's so obvious
I see you in everything, see you in everything
Just to see your face I gave it all away
Now you show me every day, you show me every day
How can I deny? I see you in everything, see you in everything
I gave it all away just to see your face now you show me every day

[Verse 2]
My selfish heart made it hard to recognize the light
But you sought after me with grace so I could rise & find
That you are the evidence of all benevolence
Now I’m free for the first time in my life

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I see you in everything
I see you in everything
You refuse to hide
Your mercy fills up the sky
I finally opened my eyes
It's in you I come alive
You might also like[Chorus]
