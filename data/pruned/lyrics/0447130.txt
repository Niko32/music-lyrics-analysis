Keep a light on those you love
They will be there when you die
Baby, there's no need to fear
Baby, there's no need to cry

[Chorus]
Every little piece of your life
Will add up to one
Every little piece of your life
Will mean something to someone

[Verse 2]
You fuse my broken bones
Back together and then
Lift the weight of the world
From my shoulders again

[Chorus]
Every little piece of your life
Will add up to one
Every little piece of your life
Will mean something to someone
Every little piece of your life
Will add up to one
Every little piece of your life
Will mean something to someone
You might also like[Bridge]
You touch my face
God whispers in my ears
There are tears in my eyes
Love replaces fear

You touch my face
God whispers in my ears
There are tears in my eyes
Love replaces fear

[Chorus]
Every little piece of your life
Will add up to one
Every little piece of your life
Will mean something to someone
Every little piece of your life
Will add up to one
Every little piece of your life
Will mean something to someone
