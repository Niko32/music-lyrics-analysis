Calling on the Night Line
Waking me up
Calling on the Night Line (Calling on the Night Line)
Can't get enough
Call me on the Night Line (Calling on the Night Line)
Whisper in my ear
Sending through the fire line (Calling on the Night Line)
What I'd like to hear
(Ooh!)

[Verse 1]
Every night about midnight
The call comes through
You turn it on the Night Line
Because you know just what to do
And I will be waiting (I will be waiting)
By the phone (By the phone) Alone

[Chorus]
Calling on the Night Line
Waking me up (Call me, baby!)
Calling on the Night Line (Hee!)
Can't get enough (Call me, darling!)
Call me on the Night Line (Hee!)
Whisper in my ear (Oh!)
Sending through the fire line
What I'd like to hear
You might also like[Verse 2]
Make it person-to-person
Make it heart-to-heart
Darling, your communication
Is sending up sparks
I will be waiting (I will be waiting)
By the phone (By the phone)
Why do not you give me a call?

[Chorus]
Calling on the Night Line
Waking me up (I wanna call)
Calling on the Nite Line
Can't get enough (Why don't you call me, baby? Hee!)
Call me on the Night Line (Call me, darling!)
Whisper in my ear (Won't you call me, baby! Hee!)
Sending through the fire line
What I'd like to hear (Oo!)

(Call me on the Night Line)
(Call me on the Night Line)
(Call me on the Night Line)
(Call me on the Night Line) Aow!

[Chorus] [x4]
Calling on the Night Line
Waking me up (Oh!)
Calling on the Night Line
Can't get enough (Call me, baby! Oh yeah!)
Call me on the Night Line (Call me, baby!)
Whisper in my ear (I wanna talk to you, baby!)
Sending through the fire line
What I'd like to hear (Talk to me, baby!)
(Call me, baby!)
(I want to talk to you!)
(Call momma, baby!)
(Hee!)
(Call me, baby!)
(My momma need a nanna!)
(Ooh yeah)
(Hee!)
(Oh!)
