Oh, how many times have you walked out and walked back in
And I cry just like a baby, after you
Oh, oh, It's funny what a fool will do

Here I am with empty arms again
Counting all the times that you walked out and walked back in
Still, my heart goes right on loving you
Oh, oh, it's funny what a fool will do

Is your love worth all these heartaches, I must think so
I can't hold you and yet I... can't let you go
You just speak and I'm a slave to you
Oh, oh, it's funny what a fool will do

Oh, oh, it's funny what a fool will doYou might also like
