You said I was what you wanted
Liar, liar
You never wanted me that way

If you don’t like it right here
Why would you stay here?
Just to be taken all I did, babe, everything

(Chorus)
If you don’t like it, baby
Find another love, another love
You don’t have the right to take it
I’ll find another, another, another, another
You don’t have to stay, you don’t have to stay

(Verse)
I tried to be what you wanted
But I’m tired, I’m tired
I don’t really need you, anyway

There’s nothing here to fight for, baby
Be on your way
You can’t be taking what I give, babe, all I give

(Chorus)
If you don’t like it, baby
Find another love, another love
You don’t have the right to take it
I’ll find another, another, another, another
If you don’t want me, baby
I’ll find another, another, another love
You don’t have the right to break me
I’ll find another, another, another love
You don’t have to stay, you don’t have to stay
You might also like(Bridge)
Move on, move on
Find another love, find another love
Move on, move on
Find another love, find another love

(Chorus)
If you don’t like it, baby
Find another love, another love
You don’t have the right to take it
I’ll find another, another, another, another
If you don’t want me, baby
I’ll find another, another, another love
You don’t have the right to break me
I’ll find another, another, another love
You can find another love, another love
You can find another love, another love
You can find another love, another love
