She was born to a mother-trucker
Raised behind the wheel
So you can blame it on the highway
For the way she can't sit still
She said life is like a windshield
It ain't no rearview mirror
The only way to get where you're goin'
Is find that higher gear

[Chorus]
And keep it rollin'
Life's gonna run you over if you don't get goin'
She said I want to feel the earth move under me
Movin' with the motion of a melody
Boy, I get the blues if the rhythm ain't got no soul
You gotta keep it rollin'

[Verse 2]
Well I knew that I was in trouble
When she told me that talk was cheap
Said if you're tired get on the sofa
'Cause the bed's no place to sleep
Then she reached down and she kissed me
Lord it knocked me to my knees
And I knew if I was gonna get naked
I's gonna have to roll up my sleeves
You might also like[Chorus]
And keep it rollin'
Love was gonna run me over if I didn't get goin'
She said I want to feel the earth move under me
Movin' with the motion of a melody
Boy, I get the blues if the rhythm ain't got no soul
You got to keep it rollin'

[Verse 3]
So I talked her into gettin' married
But she wouldn't hang up her wheels
I was afraid I'd take a back seat
To the way the highway feels
But each day she's pullin' over
More than she used to
She knows love is like the highway
The main thing you gotta do

[Chorus]
Is keep it rollin'
Life's gonna pass you by if you don't get goin'
She said I want to feel the earth move under me
Rockin' with the motion of a melody
Boy, I get the blues if the rhythm ain't got no soul
You got to keep it rollin'
Love's gonna pass you by if you don't get goin'
She said I want to feel the earth move under me
Movin' with the motion of a melody
I get the blues if the rhythm's got no soul
You got to keep it rollin'
