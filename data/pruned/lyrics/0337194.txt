If I fell in love with you
Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
Because I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands

If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start that you
Would love me more than her
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
Because I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vain

[Chorus][x2]
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
Because I couldn't stand the pain
And I would be sad if our new love was in vainYou might also like
