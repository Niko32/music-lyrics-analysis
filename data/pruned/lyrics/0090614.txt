They screaming "Yaapoye, don't go!" They asking where the fire went
'Cause I ain't made a name in the game, and I'm contemplating retirement
While reflecting on my technique, I seldom got the respect I needed;
I used to slam, blast, snort and be heavily weeded
But fate interceded, (now) I'm seeing things differently;
I see my son's eyes and the son rises instantly
Diffidence isn't within my reach- it's just not in me
Viscid Kid spits sentences so not rap, but Hip Hop can see/
The real in me, I reel in beats to bring the real outta me
And it's so surreal, it's a done deal- undoubtedly
Even without the fee, it's not salary that the world's about'
So I'm urnin' now, learnin' how to reach the world bu word o' mouth
On a sick and twisted ride toward the side
All this shit was different before my brothers' died...
My mother cried, while my son just doesn't have one
A full-time dad pulled by rap to not give up, just have fun
(So he's screamin', Daddy 'don't go...')You might also like
