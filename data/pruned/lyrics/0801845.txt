It's good to see you coming back again
It's been a long time
Since I sat with you my friend
I'll lend an ear
It's not that so severe
Time has killed the pain
And dried up every tear

And now
I'm thinking 'bout what went down
All the heartache
I laughed away just like a clown
And now
Sit around and talking
Drink some wine
I'm really glad you stopped in
To spend some time
Just sit around and talking
Thinking 'bout the past
It's funny how it lingers
But nothing's meant to last

And my mom
She'd like to say hello
But she's a little scared
And I can't let it go
So let on ease back brother
And let it slip away
Tired of hanging on to
The pains of yesterday
You might also likeAnd once again
The money is so thick
It makes your heart go numb
It makes your mind get sick

So come on by
We'll think and talk about it
Drink some wine
I'm really glad you stopped in
Brother of mine
We'll sit around and talk it
We'll drink some wine
And maybe by the morning
Everything is fine
Everything is fine
Ease back brother
Let this clear your mind

Come on by
Drink yourself a good time
Have some time
And think about each other
Sister am I fine
Yes I been all right now
Take it lightly
Step on out the front door
And see you want some time
