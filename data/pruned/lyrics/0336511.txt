We wouldn't have to meet here
In this dark secluded place
To hide our faces
If I had it my way

[Verse]
You wouldn't have to say goodbye
Then driving home dream up another alibi
If I had it my way
There'd be no more wrong numbers
When I call you on the phone
And she's there
And I wouldn't have to worry
She might find a moonlit strand of my hair
If I had it my way

[Chorus 2]
Love would not be touch and go
We'd lie here in the afterglow
Until the break of day
If I had it my way

[Chorus 3]
You would not keep leaving me
Love would not be misery
You would always stay
If I had it my way
You might also like[Chorus 1]
We wouldn't have to meet here
In this dark secluded place
To hide our faces
If I had it my way

[Chorus 2]
Love would not be touch and go
We'd lie here in the afterglow
Until the break of day
If I had it my way

[Chorus 3]
You would not keep leaving me
Love would not be misery
You would always stay
If I had it my way
