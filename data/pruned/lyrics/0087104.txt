Just starin' at the wall
Couldn't stop, I started drawin'
A million pictures of hearts
Until I ran out of room
And I'll pay for the damage
Re-paint it myself - girl, just take a second

[Pre-Chorus]
To look hard at my mess
Cause it's more than it seems, baby
It came from somewhere deep in my heart
It's bigger than us
And you'll see it too
If you

[Chorus]
If you stand back
Sometimes to see you've gotta stand back
The bigger picture's always blurred
Too close to read the words
But if you stand back
You will see much better, better
You will see much better, better
You will see much better
You might also like[Verse 2]
You backed up and then you saw
Couldn't stop, you started cryin'
A million pictures of hearts
Made a picture of you
And now you wanna keep it
That's just how it is
When you take a second

[Pre-Chorus]
To look hard at a mess
It's more than it seems, baby
Came from somewhere deep in the heart
Bigger than us
But you'll see it too
If you

[Chorus x2]
If you stand back
Sometimes to see you've gotta stand back
The bigger picture's always blurred
Too close to read the words
But if you stand back
You will see much better

If you stand back
Sometimes to see you've gotta stand back
The bigger picture's always blurred
Too close to read the words
But if you stand back
You will see much better (woah ohohoh), better
[Outro]
You will see much better, better
You will see much better, better
You will see much better, better
You will see much better, better
