Who built his house on pain and human misery
Had a wife who ran in High Society
Had several kids living lives oh so thoughtlessly

And you will never see a house so bloody pretty
Decked with tapestries in every single hall
And you will never see a house so bloody stunning
Made for the man who surely has it all

But take a closer look and you will find
His massive gold gates are made from tears
His investors lost their homes and everything
Poor investors left with nothing but their fears

Knew a man, a captain of industry
Who built his house on pain and human misery
Elected to the Board of every single civic Symphony
Attended dinners thrown by every rubber chicken charity

And you will never see a house so bloody pretty
Decked with tapestries in every single hall
And you will never see a house so bloody stunning
Made for the man who surely has it all

But take a closer look and you will find
His drivewayâ€™s paved with bricks of mad despair
His investors lost their homes and everything
Poor investors left with nothing but a prayer
You might also likeKnew a man, a captain of industry
Who built his house on pain and human misery
Died so rich, far beyond his wildest dream
Alone in his bed, nobody cared to grieve

Nobody gives a damn about the captain of industry
Nobdy gives a hoot about the captain of industry
Nobody gives a piss about the captain of industry
Nobody gives a fart about the captain of industry

Living on misery
