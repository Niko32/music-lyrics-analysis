If you say it, you better do it
If you say it, you better do it
If you say it, you better do it
You better do it
You better do it

[Verse 1]
You know, you know
I find you cute
But I can always find another you
That'll treat me like a queen
Won't leave me sitting here trying to read
Between the lines
Between the lies
Between you and me boy
You better figure out what you want
Am I what you want?

[Verse 2]
I'm not the cry type
I'm not the whine type
I'm not the wait around in limbo while you find time
I'm not the pretty please
Don't leave me
I'm the one that
Takes the bull by the horns
You might also like[Pre Chorus]
Ain't no girl in the USA
Wants a little boy whose always afraid
I'm gonna get to leavin'
Better figure out what you're feelin'
I'm up to here with the stop and go
All i really need is a yes or no
My patience has hit the ceiling
Better figure out what you're feelin'

[Chorus]
If you say it, you better do it
If you say it, you better do it
If you say it, you better do it
You better do it
You better do it

[Verse 3]
I see it seems you really think
You're the only fish in the sea
And your first surprise will be
You're thinkin, but you're not
Baby step to the plate
Baby I'm not taking no maybes
Cause I take the bull by the horns
[Pre Chorus]
Ain't no girl in the USA
Wants a little boy whose always afraid
I'm gonna get to leavin'
Better figure out what you're feelin'
I'm up to here with the stop and go
All i really need is a yes or no
My patience has hit the ceiling
Better figure out what you're feelin'

[Chorus]
If you say it, you better do it
If you say it, you better do it
If you say it, you better do it
You better do it
You better do it

[Bridge]
I'm not the cry type
I'm not the whine type
I'm not the wait around in limbo while you find time
I'm not the pretty please
Don't leave me
I'm the one that takes the bull by the horns

[Pre Chorus]
Ain't no girl in the USA
Wants a little boy whose always afraid
I'm gonna get to leavin'
Better figure out what you're feelin'
I'm up to here with the stop and go
All i really need is a yes or no
My patience has hit the ceiling
Better figure out what you're feelin'
[Chorus]
If you say it, you better do it
If you say it, you better do it
If you say it, you better do it
You better do it
You better do it
