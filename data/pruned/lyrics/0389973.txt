All right, boys, are you ready? (Yeah!)
Here it comes
Let's go!

[Chorus 1]
Reign in pain!
Come on, we're going to reign in pain
Reign in pain!
Come on, we're going to reign in pain

[Verse 1]
Get ready, we're coming for you
We're going to make our way to your town
Prepare for this evil affair by letting everyone around
Realize you'll be demonized, we're gonna make sure you get stung
Don't stop, we're about to rock
Bring your Converse shoes with the maxi-pad tongues, yeah!

[Pre-Chorus]
Your future's looking grim, let's bathe in sin
If you're looking for a show, you'll see we've got a heavy metal jamboree
It's not so nice, but we've got your vice
If you're looking for debauchery, we got a heavy metal jamboree

[Chorus 2]
Reign in pain!
Come on, we're going to reign in pain
Reign in pain!
Reign in pain!

Come with me, I can guarantee you can loan your soul to us
Understand we're a trusted brand, our metal never rusts
We're proud, we play our music loud, coming through a Marshall stack
Look mean when our haircuts scream business in the front and party in the back

[Pre-Chorus]
Your future's looking grim, let's bathe in sin
If you're looking for a show, you'll see we've got a heavy metal jamboree
It's not so nice, but we've got your vice
If you're looking for debauchery, we got a heavy metal jamboree

Make sure you give them what they want

[Chorus]
Reign in pain!
Come on, we're going to reign in pain
Reign in pain!
Come on, we're going to reign in pain

[Outro]
Reign, reign, reign, reign, reign in pain
We’re going to reign in pain
Reign, reign, reign, reign, reign in pain
We’re going to reign in pain
