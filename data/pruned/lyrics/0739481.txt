Baby...

Oh, how I wish I was by your side
Oh yeah...

[Verse 1 - Mary J. Blige & Terrence Howard]
I wanna be all you need baby
And I want you to be my superwoman
Boy, I will be your friend forever
Well, gone and leave me that heart and you can get mine
I'm gonna be your baby tonight
If you're in the dark I'll be your some light
Cause all you need is my love
Telling you what's up
So just make room for love

[Chorus - Mary J. Blige & Terrence Howard]
(It's a shake down, shake down)
I'm robbing you for your love
She's robbing me for my love
(It's a shake down, shake down)
Shakedown
Boy, you ain't gotta say nothing
Well, baby put your hands up, then
(Shake down, shake down, down)
Shake down
(Shake down, shake down, down)
(Shake down, shake down, down)
Shake down, shake down
I'm robbing you for your love

Girl, I wanna share my existence
And through time my love will stay persistent, boy
All of me is what you getting
Let the world be the witness
Bad times, we'll work it out like fitness or we live it
Cause I vow to give you my all
Boy, I will hold you up, hold you up if you fall
I see us in your chamber
Your heart's in danger
I'm taking your love
Won't you just give it up?

[Chorus ]
(It's a shake down, shake down)
Shake down
I'm robbing you for your love, boy
You robbing me for my love
(It's a shake down, shake down)
Shake down
But you ain't gotta say nothing, oh
(It's a shake down, shake down, down)
Shake down
(Shake down, shake down, down)
(Shake down, shake down, down)
(Shake down, shake down)
[Both]
I'm robbing you for your love

[Bridge - Mary J. Blige & Terrence Howard]
If love is the crime, I'm down for it
If love is the crime
Let love be the judge
I receive the verdict
Now, take me baby
Take me
In your arms
In your arms
Hold me tight
Don't put up a fight
It's a shake down
Shake down
Come on baby, get down
Get down
I'm willing to do some time, baby
Do your time, baby
To make sure that your love is mine
All mine

[Chorus - Mary J. Blige & Terrence Howard]
(It's a shake down, shake down)
I'm robbing you for your love
You robbing me for my love
(It's a shake down, shake down)
Ohhh...
And you ain't gotta say nothing
(Shake down, shake down, down)
(Shake down, shake down, down)
Shake down
(Shake down, shake down, down)
Shake down, shake down, down
(Shake down, shake down)
I'm robbing you for your love
[Verse 3 - Terrence Howard]


(Cause it's a shake down, shake down
Shake down, shake down
Cause it's a shake down
Baby come bring all your love to me
Don't you hesitate baby
Don't put up a fight
Cause it's a shake down, shake down
Shake down, shake down.)

[Outro - Mary J. Blige]
Cause it's a shake down
