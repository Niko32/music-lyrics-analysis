[Verse 1]
Can't find the reason to stay with you
By now, a reason should appear
Anybody else could understand my fear

[Chorus]
That you're much too much
You're much too much
Much too much too soon
You're much too much too soon

[Verse 2]
Don't think I'm blown away by what I am
It's just a job that keeps me traveling
One thing I've learned is how to take my time

[Chorus]
And you're much too much
You're much too much
You're much too much too soon
You're much too much too soon

[Bridge]
Don't get too heavy, baby
You've only known me for a week
Gotta keep it steady, babe
Steady, baby, whoa, gotta keep it real
Anything that I could say
Everything I've been saying
All comes down to that same old thing
That I love you, but I don't "love" you
I love you, but I don't "love" you

[Outro]
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now, baby
I know, I know, I know you, baby, know you, baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now, baby
I know, I know, I know, baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now, baby
I know, I know, I know you, baby, know you, baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now, baby
I know, I know, I know, baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now, baby
I know, I know, I know you, baby, know you, baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now, baby
I know, I know, I know, baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now, baby
I know, I know, I know you, baby, know you, baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, now, baby
I know, I know, I know, baby
Let me go, let me go, let me go, baby
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Let me go, let me go, baby...
