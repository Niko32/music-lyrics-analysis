The mothership would trip and say we/ ain’t married carry vows say we there in every/ here and now and there and then the space and time to where we/ tearing skin to live again embrace the crown we wearing wary doubled over daring dipping into outer gala-xies seeking what they talk and shout aloud about us/ we peak in to reach in around and ride up out it bout it like P/ no masters we equals and actually eagles that see into evil/ to plant seeds see it in us/ the lust rushing up to fill the broken cup finished/ hushed like, losers of a war/ turn to dust like epidermis permanently scattered on the floor/ turn this disco out when we out pop Crisco and grits hot shit hit the ceiling don’t miss your/ opportunity to lose that stick bro signals of smoke showing where to go to get slow that gizmo that dope/ but we high already soaked in that fire never broke never tired weathered hope better tires tied to the road dire situation need a wire or a rope/ while you hear that choir fat lady clearing out her throat/ turn it up a level tell her settle that was just a test of treble got the bass back here’s the placemat play that!

Made it to the light and we back for more/ taking in the night shining maps galore/ see your soul when it’s right pure attraction towards/ being more than a fight between acts and bored/ perhaps it more, course it is, forces is/ keeping it intact but the caution is offerings/ need be given everything is tied up co-dependent living/ swimming men and women in a sea of mutuality all jumped in it/ same moment we came to existing/ now we walk around head down wonder what it’s all about see a frown pick it up with the now ow/ might hurt when you getting it at first but/ light work compared to never seeing worth bruh/ what’s it worth bruh put away your search to find another wallet pocket dollar or a purse bruh/ what ya crying all hurt for burnt for oh oh oh oh/ leave yourself on the floor let it go ego planned never sharing control that’s all it know ohhhhhYou might also like
