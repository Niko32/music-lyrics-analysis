People are talking, well that's nothing new
And some things will never change
Stories are turning away from the truth
But people will stay the same

[Verse 2:]
It's only natural that we go on
To meet with the days that will come
It's only natural that we all carried forward
So step on, go on
Get rising like the morning sun

[Chorus:]
There's no need to take it to heart
There's no need to take it to heart
Only the truth can tear you apart
There's no need to take it to heart

[Verse 1]

[Verse 3:]
Well stand tall and [?]
And don't let it get you down
Make them all feel [?]
But for you I will stand my ground
You might also like[Chorus:] (2x)
