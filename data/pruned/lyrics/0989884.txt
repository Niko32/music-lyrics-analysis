Hey Mr. Policeman
I've seen you in my neighborhood
You look to me up to no good
I've seen you with your gun in your hand
Hey Mr. Policeman
I saw you shoot my good friend down
He was just having fun
Checking out a one and one

[Chorus]
It's a shame, it's a disgrace
Why every time you show your face
Somebody dies, man; somebody dies, man

[Refrain: Rick James & Teena Marie]
La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
La-la-la-la-la-la-la

[Verse 2: Rick James]
Hey Mr. Policeman
Why don't you leave the boys alone
Why don't you just roll your own, yeah
And call me on the telephone
Hey Mr. Policeman
I see you walking on your beat
Searching strangers on the street
Especially the hoes you meet, yeah
You might also like[Chorus: Rick James]
It's a shame, it's a disgrace
Why every time you show your face
Somebody dies, man; somebody dies, man

[Interlude: Rick James]

[Verse 3: Rick James]
Hey Mr. Policeman
I saw you shoot my good friend down
He was just having fun, yeah
Checking out a one and one
Hey Mr. Policeman
I see you never having fun
Strapped to your side a gun
.357 Smith Magnum
[Chorus: Rick James]
It's a shame, it's a disgrace
Why every time you show your face
Somebody dies, man; somebody dies, yeah, sing

[Refrain: Rick James & Teena Marie]
La, la-la-la-la-la-la-la
