I've been used so many times
I'm sick and tired
I'm always trying to give my love
But it's like nobody cares
Ya'll supposed to be my dearest friends

The love of my life broke my heart
And that did it

I'm talking to all of you
Who let me down
Who made me frown
Who turned me down and said
Your my friend (NO!)
One of you tell me
What did I do so wrong
Yeah
Cause I don't feel loved
That's why I'm singing this song

Oh darling, darling, darling
I need to know
Did you fake all of it
The kindness
Oh the sweetness
To think you really cared about me (OH NO!)
Is it that I'm ugly (yeah)
I'm not cool (yeah)
Is it that I tried to show I love you? (ooh)
But back to all of you
I wanted to cry
I wanted to die
And never asked you why
