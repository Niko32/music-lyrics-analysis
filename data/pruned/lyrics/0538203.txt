Blasphemy hit me in the nuts
And the chest
Staring at the dragon with the 3-winged
Breasts
I canâ€™t totally recall
The withdrawal before the moment
Breath ceded action
Desire began to foment
Foaming at the mouth
Aerodynamic with the foreplay
A rush of blood to head
Fire breath felt cold play
Chromatic scales of an ebony assortment
Melanin pressed together
Reptilian brain retorted:
Warped terms of sacrilege
No guilt for the physical
Medula of my shell pulsating
With that
Rhythmical
Encasing the empirical, spherical
Holistic spiritual necessities
Me and that untouched locked down
Sexual weaponry
The slither closer to me
Vibrating
With the hesitancy of me
But shit I had the thirst
So I opened up the armory
