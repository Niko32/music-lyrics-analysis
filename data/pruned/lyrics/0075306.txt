Wanderers this morning came by
Where did they go, graceful in the morning light?
To banner fair, to follow you softly
In the cold mountain air

[Verse 2]
Through the forest, down to your grave
Where the birds wait, and the tall grasses wave
They do not know you anymore, more, more, more

[Chorus]
Dear shadow alive and well
How can the body die?
You tell me everything
Anything true

[Verse 3]
Into town one morning I went
Staggering through premonitions of my death
I don't see anybody that dear to me

[Chorus]
Dear shadow alive and well
How can the body die?
You tell me everything
Anything true
You might also like[Outro]

I don't know what I have done
I'm turning myself to a demon
I don't know what I have done
I'm turning myself to a demon
