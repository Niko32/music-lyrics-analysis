Never knew how much I love you, never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me, I get a fever that's so hard to bear
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever
In the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 2: Natalie Cole]
Sun lights up the daytime, moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name, and you know I'm gonna treat you right
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever
In the morning
Fever all through the night

[Verse 3: Ray Charles]
Everybody's got the fever, that is something that you should know
Fever isn't such a new thing, fever started long ago

[Verse 4: Natalie Cole, Ray Charles & Both]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
