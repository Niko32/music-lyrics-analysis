Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing over the plain
And the mountains in reply
Echoing their sweet refrain

[Chorus]
Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis Deo

[Verse 2]
Come to Bethlehem and see
Christ, whose birth the angels sing
Come adore on bended knee
Christ, the Lord, the newborn King

[Chorus]
Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis Deo

[Verse 3]
See Him in a manger laid
Whom the choirs of angels praise
Mary, Joseph, lend your aid
While our hearts in love we praise
You might also like[Chorus]
Gloria, in excelsis Deo
Gloria, in excelsis Deo

[Outro]
In excelsis Deo
In excelsis Deo
Merry Christmas
From the Franklin's to all of you
