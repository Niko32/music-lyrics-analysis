I learned to live without your love, but I can't learn not to care
And all that hurt I left for you won't make my wrongs turn right
Oh, yesterday will come again tonight

Little bits and pieces that once made up our home
Comes back to visit with my mind each night when I'm alone
Oh, round and round my memories go, they're never out of sight
Oh, yesterday will come again tonight

Yesterday will come again tonight
Just as soon as I turn out the lights (Ah think about it, baby)
My mama said the seed you sow is surely what you'll reap
Every night, I find it's harvest time when I lay me down to sleep
