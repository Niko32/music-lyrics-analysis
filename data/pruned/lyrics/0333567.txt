Gonna make it really long
So that everyone can see, that I'm very unhappy

I wish I wasn’t always wrong
I wish it wasn’t always my fault
The finger that you’re pointing has knocked me on my knees
And all you need to know is…

"I’m so sorry”
It’s not like me
It’s maturity that I’m lacking
So don’t, don't let me go
Just let me know
That growing up goes slow

I wonder what my mom and dad would say
If I told them that I cry each day
And it’s hard enough to live so far away

I wish I wasn’t always cold
I wish I wasn’t always alone
When the party is over, how will I get home?
And all you need to know is...

"I’m so sorry”
It’s not like me
It’s maturity that I’m lacking
So don’t, don't let me go
Just let me know
That growing up goes slow
You might also likeIf all the rules were meant to bend
And you swore you were my friend
NowIi have to start all over again
Cause no one’s going to take your place
And I'm scared I’ll never save all the pieces of love we made

"I’m so sorry”
It’s not like me
It’s maturity that I’m lacking
So don’t, don't let me go
Just let me know
That I can slip and fall and you won't let me go
Just let me know
That growing up goes slow
And "I’m so sorry"
It’s not like me
It’s maturity that I'm lacking
So don't, don't let me go
Just let me know
That growing up goes slow
