You can be my only
Onion rings or curly fries
Quarter pounder skip the salad bar
Please don't kick my busted heart too far

I can be your oppenheim
You can be my only
Trying to think of words that rhyme
Find a notebook meet me at the car
Please don't kick my busted heart too far

I can be your soft machine
You could be my only
Cultivate obscurity
Save your tonsils in a mason jar
Please don't kick my busted heart too far

I can be your frankenstein
You could be my only
Tie me down with baler twine
Run your forked tongue along my scar
Please don't kick my busted heart too farYou might also like
