Dear friends

If you allow me

I'd like to take this opportunity

To dedicate a song

Oh, thanks, thanks thanks...

But attention attention

No no no don't be astonished

Attention attention

I'm taking a satisfaction

I don't dedicate it to a friend

I don't dedicate it to a love

Unusual decision
You might also likeI dedicate it to an asshole!

Oh yes, to a big asshole

Oh yeah, sure, you already got it

Oh yes people, he already got it

I salute you, buddy

I salute you, look at my finger

Fuck you!!! fuck you!!! fuck you!!! i salute you!

Oh yes, sure, the language is impudent

And gross, no doubt about it

But with a polite scoundrel, he won't get away with it, this bad ass

My dear people you understand

We're dealing with a bastard, vile scum

The only right exclamation... fuck you asshole!!! fuck you asshole!!!
I salute you... i salute you... asshole
