You oughta be a little more careful baby
You know I'm dangerous
With my wild imagination
You'd better stop right now
Yeah you better
Oohhh, it's too late
That pink cotton candy, the sound of your voice
Completely destroys me
I've got no choice

[Chorus:]
Yeah, I'm coming apart at the seams
Feeling you pulling my strings
Waking me up with a dream
That's so real
With passionate desperate
Pasionate desperate
Passionate desperate love

[Verse 2:]
You're holding me closer than a whisper baby
Mmm secretly I love the way you drive me crazy
Wanna feel, gotta feel
Your hands cooling my skin
I'm caught in the flames of my desire
Your pour on your kisses
Baby, that's fire
You might also like[Chorus]

[Bridge:]
Yeah, I'm coming apart at the seams
Feeling you pulling my strings
Waking me up with a dream
That's so real
With passionate desperate
Passionate desperate love
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah[x3]
I know I'm making a scene
But don't wake me up from this dream
I finally know what it means
To feel

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
Yeah, Passionate Desperate[x3]
Yeah, Passionate Desperate Love
