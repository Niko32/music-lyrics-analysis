I'm lit up like a church
You look incredible tonight
So damn good it hurts
Let's comfort each other
See the world through glassy eyes
Let go of the (?)
Come home with me, I'm okay to drive
Climb inside and...

Let's pretend that we're happy
Let's pretend we're smart
Let's pretend that we're naked
For reasons of the heart
My darlin' I've been drinkin'
I'm sinkin' like a stone
So lie with me a little
Cause I can't lie...
I can't lie alone

I'm drinkin' my usual
But I'm drinkin' unusually fast
Life is beautiful
When you're looking at it through the glass
Let's get hysterical
Let's get lively out of control
Tangled in terrible
And honestly nobody has to know
You might also likeLet's pretend that we're happy
Let's pretend we're smart
Let's pretend that we're naked
For reasons of the heart
My darlin' I've been drinkin'
And I'm sinkin' like a stone
So lie with me a little
Cause I can't lie...
I can't lie alone

Tonight I'll float down whiskey river
And wake up having done things that I
Would not consider

Let's pretend that we're happy
Let's pretend we're smart
Let's pretend that we're naked
For reasons of the heart
My darlin' I've been drinkin'
And I'm sinkin' like a stone
So lie with me a little
Cause I can't lie...
I can't lie alone
I can't lie alone
