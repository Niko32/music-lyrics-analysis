And I guess he tried most everything lowdown
He was out tomcattin' last night when he got in a great big fight
And then a big policeman came and slapped him down
He's in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)
He's in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)
Well I told him once or twice to quit drinkin' gin and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse now

Well when I met Bill's old gal Saddie and she said (have you seen my baby)
And I told her he was downtown in the can
Well old Saddie she started fussin' she went down to the jailhouse a cussin'
She said I come down here to get my man
She's in the jailhouse now (she's in the jailhouse now)
She's in the jailhouse now (she's in the jailhouse now)
So you can understand how little old Saddie got throwed in the can
She's in the jailhouse now

Well old Bill broke out one day I guess he thought he get away
But at the railway station they took him by the arm
The chief said I've come for you and Bill said (now this won't do)
Because Bill Campbell never was my name
He's in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)
He's in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)
Well old Bill he broke out and all over town the fool walked about
He's in the jailhouse now
He's in the jailhouse now (he's in the jailhouse now)
Well I told him once or twice to quit drinkin' gin and shootin' dice
He's in the jailhouse nowYou might also like
