Miss lady girl
Is putting her love on the shelf
'Cause she don't want
To be hurt by nobody else
She's taken her heart
And put it away under lock and key
But it's high time
And miss lady girl sets her heart free and gives her love to me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Michael Jackson]
But some think that diamond rings, fancy cars
Will make a big impression, yeah, ha!
But I know that all she needs is my tender
Love and affection
'Cause she still says

[Chorus]
That no one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh, no
But someone's gotta get it
I know that I will (Hee-hee! Hee-hee! Aaow!)
No one's gonna get it (Da-da-da) (Ooh!)
No one's gonna get it, oh, no (Da-da-da)
But someone's gotta get it (Da-da-da)
And I know that I will be the one who will (Hee-hee! Hee-hee! Aaow!)
Gonna get it, her love
Gonna get it, her kisses
Gonna get it, her heart
Gonna get it, get it

Miss lady girl, ha!
Has buried her feelings deep inside
'Cause she don't want, ah
To be taken for another ride
She's sick and tired, ha!
Of being on that lonely merry-go-round
She just don't know
That the ultimate love
Of her life is about to be found, hoo!

[Pre-Chorus: Stevie Wonder]
They think that ready cash, flashy clothes
Will fill her life with laughter
But I've got the very thing that she needs
True love forever after
Then no more will she say

[Chorus]
That no one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get it, oh, no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will
No one's gonna get it
No one's gonna get It, oh, no
But someone's gotta get it
I know that I will be the one who will
I'm gonna get it (I'm gonna get it)
I'm gonna get it (You ain't gon' get it)
(I'm gonna get it)
(You ain't gon' get it)
(I'm gonna get it)
(I'm gonna get it)
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Gonna get it, get it, aaow!
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Gonna get it, gonna get it
Hoo! Hoo!
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
You ain't gonna get it
You know, ah, hoo!
Aaow!
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gonna get it
I'm gon', gon' get it
