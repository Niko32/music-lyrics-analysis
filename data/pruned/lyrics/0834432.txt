I died a little each day
Until my soul slipped past the kingdom of noise
My soul slipped past the kingdom of noise
Now I hear a new song
My salvation is my tempter’s damnation
My freedom-his prison
Torn limb from limb
Torn limb from limb
This is the final cleansing
Torn limb from limb
Heart of heaven
Breathe upon me
Your deadliest air
Death has been my freedom
Death has been my cleansing
This pain is my delight
Finally I can see
I’ve found clarity
In the form of a man
Spirit’s dead, resurrected
My soul has run away
To be with new creation
