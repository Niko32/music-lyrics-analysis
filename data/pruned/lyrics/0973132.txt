Are you ready for a new style in this scene?
Start some shit!
Don't admit you were your
Ex-boyfriend's bitch
Everyday of the week

So smooth about it
Pretend you're doin' well
Obsessed about him
Baby you need him
Baby you kiss but never tell

Prepare for a letdown
We knew it all along
So don't get me wrong

Yes!
You got a way with words
And bridges you'd love to burn
You were the one, for me
And boys, please take this
All to heart
She'll tear us all apart
You were the one for me
But I was wrong
You might also likeI've seen you shake
And I've seen you get played
From bright, green eyes
You're such a lush with a

Soft simple touch
Who's not so bright

So smooth about it
Pretend you're doin' well
Obsessed about him
Baby you need him
Baby you kiss but never tell

Girl, you got a way with words
And bridges you'd love to burn
You were the one, for me
And boys, please take this
All to heart
She'll tear us all apart
You were the one for me
But I was wrong

Girl, you got a way with words
And bridge you'd love to burn
You were the one, for me
And boys, please take this
All to heart
She'll tear us all apart
You were the one for me
But I was wrong
