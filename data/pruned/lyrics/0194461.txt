I saw her turn her head
In a drop-dead gaze
She was peeking out over the top
Of those wire-rim shades
Now it wasn't my charm
And it wasn't my grin
That had that little secretary
Dialed right in
She wasn't looking at me, man
She was looking at my feet

[Chorus]
It's these twenty-two hundred
And twenty-five dollar
Pair o' handmade genuine fine
Horned-back kicks
With a seven-row stitch
And a three dollar sidewalk shine
Yeah they're made to fit
And they're hard to find
Make a pretty woman look down each time
I got the baddest boots on the boulevard
Yeah, the baddest boots on the boulevard

[Verse 2]
They were made by a little man
Down in El Paso
I was passing though town
Singing at the rodeo
He said they cost a little more
But for what it's worth
There ain't another pair like them
On God's green earth
Then I handed him my money
And he sized me up
You might also like[Chorus]
It's these twenty-two hundred
And twenty-five dollar
Pair o' handmade genuine fine
Horned-back kicks
With a seven-row stitch
And a three dollar sidewalk shine
Yeah they're made to fit
And they're hard to find
Make a pretty woman look down each time
I got the baddest boots on the boulevard
Yeah, the baddest boots on the boulevard

[Verse 3]
I got the baddest boots on the boulevard
Yeah, the Baddest boots on the boulevard
When I pull them on I start singing a song
Make me want to tuck my britches leg's inside them
Letâ€™s take a stroll

[Chorus]
It's these twenty-two hundred
And twenty-five dollar
Pair o' handmade genuine fine
Horned-back kicks
With a seven-row stitch
And a three dollar sidewalk shine
Yeah they're made to fit
And they're hard to find
Make a pretty woman look down each time
I got the baddest boots on the boulevard
Yeah, the baddest boots on the boulevard
They're the baddest boots on the boulevard
[Outro]
Look here girl
Yeah, they're bad alright
