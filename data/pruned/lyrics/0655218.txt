They ?
(oh do they now?)
Your friends wanna know our secret
Too much for them to handle
Your friends ask where you sneak off to
You answer with lust? every time
You better not say a darn word
Don't even say it's a surprise
'cause how is it gon' look
If we both show up
With my clothes undone
And your make-up smudged
No, I don't give a...
We could say so what
If they ask if we...
Tell them, yeah so what?

(Hook)
So what? (so what)
So what? (tell them so what?)
So what?
So what?


Know this Asian named Cindy
Swear she from Sin city
No, she not from Vegas
Just means she has seen plenty
She worries about her man
He threatens that he would leave her
Behind every woman, is a man who couldn't keep her
So the ugliest dudes, get the prettiest girls
And the prettiest people, live in hideous worlds
And the prettiest girls, always end up alone
They say beauty's skin deep
Girl, you bad to the bone, to the boneYou might also like
