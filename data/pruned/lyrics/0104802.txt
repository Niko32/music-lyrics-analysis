Uh, life is awkward, sometimes scary
Pussy fresh, so pop the Cherry
Gettin' shit done, Call me Larry
I'll drink vodka then drive, just dare me

Verse 1:Lil Slick
Yeah, I live a Awkward life, bitches love my style
We discussing money? I got 20 piles
Haven't got up wit Jay, in such a while
I act like a grown ass man, ya act like a child
Uh, I'm a baller, I got ten rings
I hit ya brother, & make ya feel the sting
Shot out to Jay we alike
That's why we fight
See pussy I bite
Uh.......
