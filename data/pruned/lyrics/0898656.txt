Glory to the new born king
Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled
Joyful all ye nations rise
Join the triumph of the skies
With angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born king

Hail the heaven born prince of peace
Hail the son of rightousness
Light and life to all he brings
Risen with healing in his wings
Mild he lays his glory by
Born that no man more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth
Hark the herald angels sing
Glory to the new born king
Hark the herald angels sing
