Hark! The herald angels sing
'Glory to the newborn King;'
Peace on earth and mercy mild;
God and sinners reconciled.'
Joyful, all ye nations rise
Join the triumph in skies;
With angelic host proclaim
'Christ is born in Bethlehem!'

[Chorus]
Hark the herald angels sing
'Glory to the newborn King.'

[Verse 2]
Christ by highest heav'n adored
Christ the everlasting Lord:
Late in time, behold Him come
Offspring of a virgin's womb
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see
Hail th'incarnate Deity!
Pleased as man with men to dwell
Jesus our Immanuel

[Chorus]
Hark! the herald angels sing
'Glory to the newborn King.'

Hail the heav'n born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings
Ris'n with healing in His wings
Mild He lays His glory by
Born that man no more may die
Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth

[Chorus]
Hark! the herald angels sing
'Glory to the newborn King.'
