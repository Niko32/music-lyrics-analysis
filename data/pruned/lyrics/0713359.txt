You got to leave me now, you got to go alone
You got to chase a dream, one that's all your own
Before it slips away

When you're flyin' high, take my heart along
I'll be the harmony to every lonely song
That you learn to play

[Chorus 1: Thile, Sara Watkins & Sean Watkins/Thile]
When you're soarin' through the air
I'll be your solid ground
Take every chance you dare
I'll still be there
When you come back down
When you come back down

[Verse 2: Thile]
I'll keep lookin' up, awaitin' your return
My greatest fear will be that you will crash and burn
And I won't feel your fire

I'll be the other hand that always holds the line
Connectin' in between your sweet heart and mine
I'm strung out on that wire
You might also like[Chorus 2: Thile, Sara Watkins & Sean Watkins/Thile]
And I'll be on the other end
To hear you when you call
Angel, you were born to fly
And if you get too high
I'll catch you when you fall
I'll catch you when you fall

[Bridge: Thile]
Your memory's the sunshine every new day brings
I know the sky is calling
Angel, let me help you with your wings

[Chorus 1: Thile]
When you're soarin' through the air
I'll be your solid ground
Take every chance you dare
I'll still be there
For when you come back down

[Outro: Thile, Sara Watkins & Sean Watkins/Thile]
Take every chance you dare
I'll still be there
When you come back down
When you come back down
