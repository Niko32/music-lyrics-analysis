Painting pictures on the window pane
Feelings my heart cannot explain
Oh, the silence, sounds like music
Seems like I can hear a melody
Baby that's what you do to me

One thing I'm sure of, whether it's wrong or it's right
I only want to be with you, tonight
And if you want me to, baby ask me to stay
Heaven's just a whisper away

Feel the magic, taking over
Please don't stop before we lose control
Baby just let your feeling go, let it go now
Soft and tender, like the morning
We get closer than we've ever been
We're almost to the rainbow's end

One thing I'm sure of, whether it's wrong or it's right
I only want to be with you, tonight
And if you want me to, baby ask me to stay
Heaven's just a whisper away, Heaven's just a whisper away

And I heard the winds of forever
Calling out my name
And it's paradise, when I'm with you
I'll never be the same
You might also likePlease don't wake me if I'm dreaming
'Cause this time, this one is coming true
So nice to share my dreams with you

One thing I'm sure of, whether it's wrong or it's right
I only want to be with you, tonight
And if you want me to, baby then ask me to stay
Heaven's just a whisper away, Heaven's just a whisper away
