Jamming down the highway, feeling no pain
Mother nature, two wheels and a chain
It's good to be alive and brighter
Whisper in my ear, girl, hold on a little tighter

[Chorus]
You know it's alright
Living and loving every day and night
Thanking the lord for the music in me
Piece of mind and feeling free

[Verse 2]
Soon I'll be on the road, picking guitar
Knowing that my home ain't very far
But don't you worry sweet thing cause you know I'll be there
To kiss my Tennessee girl with the long golden hair

[Chorus]You might also like
