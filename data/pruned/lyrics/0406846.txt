Change is inevitable
Why hold on to what you have to let go of?
Like, did I really break your heart?
Was it all my fault?
If you don't knock it off
You know like I know where this was headed

[Hook 1]
I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer, baby
I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer

[Verse 2]
Lani Kai was nice
Turquoise seas and ocean breezes
Loving you was nice
But it's a new day, a new season
I’ve been sad inside
And he could see it, picked up your pieces
We are just alike
And alright, alright, alright

[Hook 2]
He’s a wanderer
He’s a wanderer, baby
He’s a wanderer
He’s a wanderer

I started as a love song
24 years in the making
Moving from place to place and
I never really settled down
Without a place to call home
I got so used to the changes
Moving from stranger to strangest
You should face it
I am crazy

[Hook 1]
I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer, baby
I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer

[Bridge]
Shame on me for changing
No, shame on you for staying the same
Shame on me for changing
No, shame on you for staying the same

[Hook 1]
I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer, baby
I'm a wanderer
I'm a wanderer
[Outro]
Maybe I'm just a wanderer
Maybe I'm just a wanderer
