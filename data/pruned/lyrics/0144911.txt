Here again, you look me in the eye
And I'm staring back your way, as you wait for a reply
Let silence speak my truth
I just can't seem to find the words to say to you
That will appease your mind
Thought you would know by now
But you should know by now
That I don't wanna wait, forever is upon us
Wait for never would be wrong and
I can't go at it alone
Need you, need you right now
Ayy, I need you right now
Ayy, I need you

[Verse]
Hey, you got my back on the wall
But for the things I need, you ain't help me at all
I think its time that these walls crumble and fall
Yes, you indeed love me, but will you come when I call?
But would you come when I call?
But would you come when I call?
Yes, you indeed love me, but will you come when I call?
I think it's time that these walls crumble and fall
Your love is felt, not seen, I don't feel you at all, no
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Dissipate into me, circulate, let it bleed
Start me up like gasoline, you are my everything
(You are my everything, you are my everything...)

[Chorus]
So baby just touch me now, my hands are reaching out
Been waiting for so long, let's skip the talking now
Before it gets too late, forever is upon us
Wait for never would be wrong and
I can't go at it alone
Need you, need you right now
Ayy, I need you right now
Ayy, I need you

[Bridge]
Foolishly they be mixing
Love and a drug addiction
Bet they gon' feel the affliction
Watching them all as they fixing
Lust like it's all our religion, society slipping
Intro the grips of the rich and downward we're spiraling quick
(I just can't seem to find, the words to say to you)
Are you with me? (Yeah...) Are you with me now?

[Pre-Chorus - Variation]
Oh, dissipate into me...into me
Start me up like gasoline you are...gasoline you are my...
(You are my everything, you are my everything...)
[Chorus]
So baby just touch me now, my hands are reaching out
Been waiting for so long, let's skip the talking now
Before it gets too late, forever is upon us
Wait for never would be wrong and
I can't go at it alone
Need you, need you right now
Ayy, I need you right now
Ayy, I need you

[Verse - Variation]
Hey, you got my back on the wall
I think its time that these walls crumble and fall
Yes, you indeed love me, but will you come when I call?
But would you come when I call?
But would you come when I call?
Yes, you indeed love me, but will you come when I call?
I think it's time that these walls crumble and fall
Your love is felt, not seen, I don't feel you at all, no
