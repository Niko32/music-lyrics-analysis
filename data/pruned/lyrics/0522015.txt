Had a problem, I can't leave it alone
There's a problem where your thoughts were my own
And I can't talk like this with anyone else
I can't talk like this with anyone else
If you ever wanted to be the one
The one to solve it, well it's already done
I can't talk like this with anyone else
I can't talk like this with anyone
(Anyone but you)

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
I figured you ought to know
We're part of a problem solved
As long as we're both involved
That's part of a problem solved

[Verse 2]
And it feels like we've been here before
But you ought to know
Yeah, you ought to know
I'm sorry if it took a while to explain
But now you're here, well I'll say it again
Don't wanna talk like this with anyone else
Don't wanna talk like this with anyone
(Anyone but you)

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I figured you ought to know
We're part of a problem solved
As long as we're both involved
That's part of a problem solved
