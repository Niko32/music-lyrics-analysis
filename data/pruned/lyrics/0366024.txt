I search for peace, connectivity and freedom as well
A different mindset, not acting like I’m under a spell
And so I reach forwards hoping to get rid of this hell
Of a set mindset and acting like I’m under a spell

Verse 1:
I’m like a bird
I’m looking up and hoping to fly
Though hard I try
I can’t defy my O-G design
It’s so absurd
My wings can take me up on a high
Though hard I try
A weight is pulling down on all sides

And now I’m hurt
The pain is feeling oh-so-real
‘Cause I’m pressed down, underground
The top is surrealism
And I
Just wonder about the matter appeal
That I never knew, when I signed up
Was part of the deal

Chorus:
I search for peace, connectivity and freedom as well
A different mindset, not acting like I’m under a spell
And so I reach forwards hoping to get rid of this hell
Of a set mindset and acting like I’m under a spell

And so I steal
Every moment that I think I can
Gotta take chances
And understand whatever I can
And then advance
Freedom is a myth of the past
They say and I
Will make sure I get back there fast

Because I’m me
And not you’re expectations you see?
Don’t be deceived
Your little servant I’ll never be
So please believe
I am the one that you should relieve
‘Cause from slavery to liberty
I wanna be free

Chorus:
I search for peace, connectivity and freedom as well
A different mindset, not acting like I’m under a spell
And so I reach forwards hoping to get rid of this hell
Of a set mindset and acting like I’m under a spell

Verse 3:
Captivate
Instigate
And make us thrive on their hate
Participate I will not do
And pain I will not create
For your sake
Independence is on the plate
And there’s a possibility of making freedom safe
Chorus:
I search for peace, connectivity and freedom as well
A different mindset, not acting like I’m under a spell
And so I reach forwards hoping to get rid of this hell
Of a set mindset and acting like I’m under a spell
