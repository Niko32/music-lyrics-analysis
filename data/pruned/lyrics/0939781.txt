If you've got leavin' on your mind
Tell me now, get it over
Hurt me now, get it over
If you've got leavin' on your mind

[Chorus]
If there's a new love in your heart
Well, tell me now, get it over
Hurt me now, get it over
If there's a new love in your heart

[Verse 2]
Don't leave me here
In a world filled with dreams that might have been
Hurt me now, get it over
I may learn to love again

[Chorus]
If there's a new love in your heart
Well, tell me now, get it over
Hurt me now, get it over
If there's a new love in your heart
Hurt me now, get it over
If there's a new love in your heartYou might also like
