You get up every morning 'fore the sun comes up
Toss a lunchbox into a pickup truck
A long, hard day sure ain't much fun
But you've gotta get it started if you wanna get it done
You set your mind and roll up your sleeves
You're workin' on a working man's Ph.D

[Verse 2]
With your heart in your hands and the sweat on your brow
You build the things that really make the world go around
If it works, if it runs, if it lasts, for years
You bet your bottom dollar, it was made right here
With pride, and honor and dignity
From a man with a working man's Ph.D

[Chorus]
Now there ain't no shame in a job well done
From driving a nail to driving a truck
As a matter of fact, I'd like to set things straight
A few more people should be pullin' their weight
And if you want a cram course in reality
You get yourself a working man's Ph.D

[Verse 3]
Now when the quittin' whistle blows and the dust settles down
There ain't no trophies or cheering crowds
You'll face yourself at the end of the day
And be damn proud of whatever you've made
Can't hang it on the wall for the world to see
But you've got yourself a working man's Ph.D
You might also like[Chorus]
Now there ain't no shame in a job well done
From driving a nail to driving a truck
As a matter of fact, I'd like to set things straight
A few more people should be pullin' their weight
And if you want a cram course in reality
You get yourself a working man's Ph.D
