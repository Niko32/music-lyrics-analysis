Yo, turn the light up a little
Hey, XO baby!
For the niggas going through the struggle worldwide

[Verse 1:]
It's bigger than your block, boy, it don't stop, boy
I wouldn't tell you wrong, I wouldn't lie, boy
We in a big world, we living in a box
Had us hustling even when we was paranoid
Smarter than we look, dark so they think we crooks
But couldn't come outside without bad looks
Killing friends and neighbors, no food in the fridgerator
Like, I don't know why they hating, they ain't gon' pay us
But they payed the preacher, they mothers when they see us
"Lady, I'm just trying to eat, please don't call the polices."
Don't you play that lotto, and this is how we gamble
Going broke and trying to reassemble the shambles
[Hook:]
And you can do anything if you try
Don't let 'em tell you no different, keep your head up high
And you can do anything if you try
Don't let 'em tell you no different, keep your head up high

[Verse 2:]
It's bigger than your hood, homie
I know you could, homie
You can do anything, but gotta be good, homie
That's what my soul told me, as I was laying OZ's
Like James's I had them navy Sauconys
Can't stop, can't lie, God, he gave me a lot
They blot, they rock, [?] on a fly
Take what I've got, yeah I won't take you to live
Tried to dumb us down, that's why we ain't changing our minds
Ain't no looking back, ain't nothing but tunnel vision
Got off track cause of crack, we was fucking with it
Money doubling in the jungle, and they couldn't tame us
Wanted to be like us but couldn't, so "niggas" they named us
