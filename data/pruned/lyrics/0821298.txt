I wish I couldn't remember
The time when all was so bright
I don't believe there is another way I can live
Pain was the damn reward
For all the good I've done
My heart can love for real
Now hate is all he can feel

[Verse 2]
How could you fill my soul with my hate? (How could you fill?)
Is this what I deserved? (Is this what I deserved?)
I'm sick and tired of fighting with myself (I'm sick and tired)
I want to end this hell

[Chorus]
Time has come to fight for my life
I never thought I'd have to escape from myself one day
Still it's so hard not to think of what life could have been with her love
I beg someone please tear off this heart from me

[Post-Chorus]
It's so easy when you think
To be human means to be weak

[Instrumental]

And as I cross the highway of life
Trying to find the answers inside my brainwashed mind
I know there's a long way to go
But someday I'll find my path back home

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Run far away once again
Life's a game that we all have to play
Just as best as we can
Play this game today
And there's no right way

[Chorus]
Time has come to fight for my life
I never thought I'd have to escape from myself one day
Still it's so hard not to think of what life could have been with her love
I beg someone please tear off this heart from me
