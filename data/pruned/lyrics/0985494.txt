I need your love to get me through
All the things I wanna do
Babe, if you want me to
I'll get that on my knees for you

But, you gotta give me a little sign
You got the same thing on your mind
Every day, every night
Give me the green light, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
And let it roll, let it ride
I'll be your dog till you're satisfied
I'll be your puppet on a string
'Cause for a spoonful of your sugar, I would do anything

[Chorus]
Anything you want
Anything you need
Anytime at all

[Verse 2]
It is so hard for you to see
I just love your company
And there ain't nothing I won't do
Just to prove my love for you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So let it roll, let it ride
I'll be your dog till you're satisfied
I'll be your puppet on a string
'Cause for a spoonful of your sugar, I would do anything

[Chorus]
Anything you want
Anything you need
Anytime, anytime at all

[Verse 3]
So baby, try to understand
I was born to be your man
Don't keep me knocking at your door
Just tell me, "Yes" or tell me, "No"

[Pre-Chorus]
And let it roll, let it ride
I'll be your dog till you're satisfied
I'll be your puppet on a string
For a spoonful of your sugar, I would do anything

[Chorus]
Anything you want
Anything you need
Anytime, anytime at all
[Bridge]
(Anything you want)
(Anything you need)
(Anything you want)
(Anything you need)
Anytime that you want (Anything you want)
Anytime at all (Anything you need)
Anything that you want (Anything you want)
Anything you need (Anything you need)

[Outro]
Anything you want
Anything you need
