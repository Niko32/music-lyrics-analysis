I've got this longing for you even when I call your name
How I wish you were here
The never ending story of loneliness and pain
Oh, how I wish you were here

[Verse 1]
It's been so long since I saw your face
And I'm missing your warm embrace
Recapturing the times that we shared
Oh baby, how I wish you were here

[Chorus]
I've got this longing for you even when I call your name
How I wish you were here
The never ending story of loneliness and pain
Oh, how I wish you were here

[Verse 2]
Holding hands, feeling your sweet lips
Brings me back to when we first met
What we had was not what we thought it would be
I would let nothing come between you and me

[Pre-Chorus]
All this love tell me where did it go
You and me
Can't you see how I'm hurting inside
Won't you please
You might also like[Chorus]
I've got this longing for you even when I call your name
How I wish you were here
The never ending story of loneliness and pain
Oh, how I wish you were here
I've got this longing for you even when I call your name
How I wish you were here
The never ending story of loneliness and pain
Oh, how I wish you were here

[Break]

[Chorus]
I've got this longing for you even when I call your name
How I wish you were here
The never ending story of loneliness and pain
Oh, how I wish you were here
I've got this longing for you even when I call your name
How I wish you were here
The never ending story of loneliness and pain
Oh, how I wish you were here
I've got this longing for you even when I call your name
How I wish you were here
