Tha Biz-Tha Bizness

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Three in the morning, you know I'm horny
So why don't you come over my place and put a smile on my face?
If you're leaving the club, shawty, hurry up
So we can get this party started and take off our clothes now
You already know what time it is
Reach up in that dresser where them condoms is
And, baby, when I get it, I'll never let it go
Gonna take it slow

[Pre-Chorus: Chris Brown]
We ain't gon' stop 'til 9 A.M
If you can't take it all, baby, say when
Make you cum over and over again
And I'ma leave it in

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall, Both]
When we do it all night
We can do it all night
Girl, I'ma give it to you all night
So fly, girl
Don't you be on that bullshit, yeah, yeah
All night

All night
Don't you be on that bullshit, yeah, yeah
All night
So fly, girl (Oh-oh-oh)
