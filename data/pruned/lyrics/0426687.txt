You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why (Why)
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 1]
He's making a list, he's checking it twice
Gonna find out who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town!

[Bridge]
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 3]
Little tin horns, little toy drums
Rudy-toot-toot and rummy tum tums
Santa Claus is coming to town
You might also like[Verse 4]
Little curly head dolls that cuddle and coo
Elephant boats and kiddie cars too
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Verse 5]
All the kids in Girl and boy land
Will have a jubilee
They're gonna build a toy land town
All around that Christmas tree

[Chorus]
So, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

[Chorus]
You better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
Oh, you better watch out, you better not cry
You better not pout, I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
[Outro]
He's coming to town
