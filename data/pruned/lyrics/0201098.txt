He says he feels your pain, he felt mine too
He feels everything that belongs to you
He builds a trap that you can't see
For wholesome girls like you and me
It doesn't mater if you're sleeping
To get control that he has been seeking
Yeah, he wants to make employment out of you
He's scared 'cause he knows his working days are through

[Chorus]
'Cause he's fired, say it again
There's no good time for this to end
Come on, fired, say it again
There's no good time for this to end
Even though he's secret and true, you know
The same old shit won't do
Come on, fired, say it again
There's no good time for this

[Verse 2]
He says he feels your pain, he felt mine too
He'll say anything to get inside of you
Resistance to his trap, resistance to him
You're either irrational or on some kind of whim
You haven't changed, no, not at all
Except now your teasing gives him blue balls
He wants to work by taking care of you
He's scared 'cause he knows these words are true
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause he's fired, say it again
There's no good time for this to end
Come on, fired, say it again
There's no good time for this to end
How long can this go on?
Forever isn't that strong
Come on, fired, say it again
There's no good time for this

[Bridge]
Spit it out, spit it out
Chew 'til my heart's eaten out
This is what it's all about
For you, for you, it's always about you
Eat until you're full of me
Suck me dry 'til I don't have anything
Inside out, inside of me
You're inside out, get out of me
Don't tell me what is mine this time
You'll just have to get out 'cause this is mine
This time

[Chorus]
Fired, say it again
Let's bring this to ten
Come on, fired, say it again
This is the time for this to end
How long can this go on?
Forever isn't that strong
Come on, fired, say it again
