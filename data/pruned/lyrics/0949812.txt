I'm awake
It's ok now I am safe now
I'm awake I'm awake
I'm awake now

For those of you who think I'm sleeping
As you stand beside the bed
For those of you who may be weeping
Don't look for me among the dead

I'm awake now no mistake now
I'm awake
It's ok now I am safe now
I'm awake I'm awake
I'm awake now

As I'm moving to the clearing
Familiar faces all around
There's this music that I'm hearing
Wonderful other worldly sound

I'm awake now no mistake now
I'm awake
It's ok now I am safe now
I'm awake I'm awake
I'm awake now
You might also likeI wondered if I would get thru it
And come out on the other side
What you've heard there's something to it
Now my eyes are open wide

I'm awake now no mistake now
I'm awake
It's ok now I am safe now
I'm awake I'm awake
I'm awake now
I am safe It's ok now
I'm awake
I'm awake now
