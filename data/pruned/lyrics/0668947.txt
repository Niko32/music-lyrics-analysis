I found myself between two places
Neither of them home
I could not recognize the faces
I've never felt so alone, so alone
I found myself between two choices
To settle or to run
All my life I've heard the voices
This time mines the only one, the only one

[Chorus]
I wanna feel what the wind feels like
I wanna go that high
And feel no fear instead of being down here
Holding up the sky, holding up the sky

[Verse 2]
Life astounds us in an instant
Changing all we know
Blink just once and then you've missed it
All you can do is watch it go, watch it go

[Chorus]
You wanna feel what the wind feels like
You wanna go that high
And feel no fear instead of being down here
Holding up the sky, holding up the sky
You might also like[Verse 3]
I found myself between two lifetimes
The sunset and the dawn
I reached out and took the lifeline
Offered up between here and gone, here and gone

[Chorus]
We wanna feel what the wind feels like
We wanna go that high
And feel no fear instead being down here
Holding up the sky
I wanna feel what the wind feels like
I wanna go that high
And feel no fear instead being down here
Holding up the sky, holding up the sky
Holding up the sky
