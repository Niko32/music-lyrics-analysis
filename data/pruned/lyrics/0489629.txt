Money doesn't mean a thing
But then again, it's important
Unless you'd like live in nowhere
Money drives the car and gets the girl
And bills and taxes circle evermore
A hatful of dollars or a boxful of nickels

[Verse 2]
Why the hell did you think to say
That money don't mean a thing
It makes the living world go round
Let's form those unions
Occupy outside on Wall Street
Let's have the workers making zero revenue

[Chorus]
Take a look at your town
Fiery with nothingness
To work to the ground
Money makes the world go round

[Verse 3]
Let's throw a kegger
Hell, let's have a jubilee
Cause now things are costing no money
We'll sit on our asses
While workers work unpaid jobs
We've gotta get free items somewhere
You might also like[Chorus]

Fuck
