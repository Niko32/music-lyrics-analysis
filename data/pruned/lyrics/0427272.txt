No candle light, no wine
No plans and that’s just fine
Just put your hand in mine
Nothing fancy
Don’t need no party dress
I like you just like this
Just like the night we met
Nothing fancy

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, this is everything I’m looking for
There’s nothing you could do
To make me want you more

[Chorus]
So I hope it’s still okay
That when I feel this way
“I love you” is all I say
Nothing fancy

[Pre-Chorus]
