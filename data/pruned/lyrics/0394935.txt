I gave them what they wanted and they want some more
I'll be even more solid on the sophomore
I got back in the lab to start writing some new stuff
And got it out quicker than the Heimlich manoeuvre
Wanna make a cut?  Get a blade or me
Because I stay sharp like my name's Sean Bean
They've got a lot of balls but they make wack sounds
All I've gotta say is start up a baseball team
I'll take 14 plus another 2k
It's my year, I don't give a fuck what you say
And it's my tenth, mate, it's an anniversary
So, to celebrate, I'm killing an adversary
I'm the best, there's no greater word for me
You could never associate the worst with me
I'm all set to go and play so dirtily
It's like Krept or Kon's laid a verse for me

[Hook]
I don't wanna fill a vacancy
But I know the job was made for me
I didn't mean to make a scene
All I wanna do is raise the heat, raise the heat, raise the heat
All I wanna do is raise the heat, raise the heat, raise the heat
All I wanna do is raise the heat

And I ain't changed, I ain't in the game for the wealth
But this weed ain't gonna pay for itself
So, as long as I can afford to blaze an L
I'm rich biatch, no Dave Chapelle
Being a celeb is much less important
Than being in a list of the best recorders
But laying weak lyricists to rest is awesome
If he's saying he's killing it, I'm Dexter Morgan
Miss Barclay's still to blame for my skill
Conrad Murray never made this Mike ill
So I'll see a nurse if I can't get the plaudits
That's another way to end up on a ward's lists
I did wait for em, now it's Pane's turn
I'm impatient as an inpatient
And we can see from my diagnosis
That weak MC's'll be dying to know this

[Hook]

[Verse 3]
If I'm gonna be perfectly honest
You're the worst thing since Germany's sausage
I wouldn't act like I was impressed by your record
Even if you got Ron Burgundy on it
People think I'm gonna create a mass change
I would've done before but I can't lie
Even if I wanted to save the rap game
There's too much porn on my hard drive
And I really don't want all the attention
You can stop there, this is not my job, it's a pastime
I think it is an honour to be mentioned in your top 10
Just as long as I'm not in the last nine
It's all a bit unsettling in my mind with
Good and evil wrestling for my ideas
Everything's gone so dark in my world
That I couldn't even tell you where the limelight is
[Hook]
