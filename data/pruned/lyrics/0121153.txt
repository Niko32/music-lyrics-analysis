Waking up dead from a nightmare
Right there outer body feeling the might of fear
The nights near
Shadows stay resilient to form a silhouette as she dances to a minuet
Triple time it's 3/4 quarters to a whole
3 points triple shot attempt to take my soul
Try to walk away I feel it in my soles
Looking for some class but the books stay on hold
For it to connect its gotta be the shoes
They look at me as I look at 40 of you
Provisions don't line up with what is required
I watch her movements as to what she desires
As the clock strikes 10 31
Limited not by imagination but some sort of fund
Mitigating circumstance in this institute
The machine freezes as it attempts to boot

Chorus
They lied, they lied, I don't even know why I tried
I tried, I tried, any and all attempts to save lives
Your life your life who what when how where the why
They lie, they lie, they lie, they lie

Verse 2
Luring you in with an appetizing meal
Selling you what you want to hear how good it feels
Sign on the dotted line the deal is sealed
Commence the nightmare I can't tell what is real
Suffering through the heat of the devils kitchen
Where children steal slices of pie during intermission
My skin hurts and my mouth burns
A sense of deja vu from the first year curse
The name rhymes with another cripple
The joke was on me they called it the riddle
Pulling my strings song played on a fiddle
Hallucinations purgatory laying down in the middle
Now you want to give yourself to faith real quick
It is sick for if you ever believed in it
The characters around surround
The rest laid off to silence now

They lied they lied and I don't even know why I tried
I tried I tried any and all attempts to save lives
Your life your life who what when how where the why
They lie they lie they lied they lied
