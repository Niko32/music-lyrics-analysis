Bleeding innocence lies
Searching for serenity
Where even death may come to die

Spread your wings and fly away
Soaring high above all your yesterdays

Angels wings soak all I bleed
It's raining red as they fly
Staining the world forever
As bleeding innocence lies

Spread your wings and fly away
Soaring high above all your yesterdays

Darkness divinity
Endless infinity
Let our journey begin
...As twilight descendsYou might also like
