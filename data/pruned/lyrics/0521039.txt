[Chorus ]
The brokenhearted i play this song for'us hey!
Nobody treating you right like you want it
Please somebody tell me what we're gonna do?

It's maybe love, life or everything else
You  facing day to day; just to keep  you ready hey!

Sometime love comes and pass you by hey!
Nobody treating you right like you want it

You realy wanna know and trying you better take it slowlly
Believe in univers
Nothing can't changed your destiny

[verse 1]x2
And one more time this love can comes
And knocked on your door

I can see your heart beating inside
Without any protection you feel so right
You smille
Do you know it's a new race
You might also like[verse 2]
Listen
HOW could you think love is invisible in your heart
And in your life
How could you think this hey!
How could you think it hey

How could you do something you love
Without this love here in your heart
How could you do this hey!
How could you do this hey

How could dance dance
How could you move move
How could you dance dance and flying without love in your heart
How could you do this no
How could you do it

[ Chorus]
