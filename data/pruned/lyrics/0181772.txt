Just a touch on the shoulder I'm passing out
Wish I coulda told her I'm freaking out
For I have been poisoned by butterflies
And I have been stared blankly by those eyes

[Chorus]
Ooohhh ooohhh
What don't kill only makes us stronger, I guess I'm stronger now
What don't kill only makes us stronger, I guess I'm stronger now

[Verse 2]
Just a weep in the willow and I'm petrified
My head on a pillow of pesticides
For I have been killing those butterflies
Is that what I'm willing to sacrifice
To sacrifice
To sacrifice

[Chorus]
Ooohhh ooohhh
What don't kill only makes us stronger, I guess I'm stronger now
Ooohhh ooohhh
What don't kill only makes us stronger, I guess I'm stronger now
What don't kill only makes us stronger, I guess I'm stronger now, now

[Chorus]
Ooohhh ooohhh
What don't kill only makes us stronger, I guess I'm stronger now
Ooohhh ooohhh
What don't kill only makes us stronger, I guess I'm stronger now
What don't kill only makes us stronger, I guess I'm stronger now

Roll with whatever flows or comes my way I always say
