And all these things
We should have said
I can't keep my head above it
I'm slowly drowning in my bed

I just want you to be around
When it all comes down on me
Won't you show me how
And wake me from my sleep
I'm just waiting
Anticipating
Nothing at all

I'm tempted like the punch
That's about to hit me
Feeling guilty but I don't know why
I'm sick of all these predictions
Cause they're not really helping me

I just want you to be around
When it all comes down on me
Won't you show me how
And wake me from my sleep
I'm just waiting
Anticipating
Nothing at allYou might also like
