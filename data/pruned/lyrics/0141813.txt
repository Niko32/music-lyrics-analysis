I mean I’m not on crack but my spirit is high
I am high flying lyrical soaring bird
Stay off the wrong high never see me smoking herb
Dish off an assist like from road to curb
Smoother than ice cream more like sherb
But maybe ask me am i in my sanity
Or instead of what might of been ask what can it be
Mess with my style leave you lyrically stranded see
I keep my flow good so it’s no need to arrest me
You here my call now you know i comin
Cuz i keep the sound beatin like a boy who’s drumin
Make sure all my inspirations get the most love
The B that comes between that will not keep it’s buzz
These dudes are fake they don’t have the heat snug
And if you da light of this show it’s time to pull the plug
Cuz there’s bout to be some friction someone get a rug
Then when I done with you I'll sweep you off the side like a bug
Put it over your head for that suffication
Then I’ll be rowland deep man that’s my motivation( get it)
I can be the sickest guy ask the other patients
People badly influence the next generation
If your train has stopped better get out the station
Cuz i’ve already beatin u not like we was racin
I’ll stay a step ahead of you haters like a race you race in
Look you better tie your shoes, wait i already laced’ em
