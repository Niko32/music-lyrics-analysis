Now there goes my doorbell
And I'm happy she's here, but I gotta wait a minute
And there's number two and even though shawty's the shit, I can't let her know she's winnin'
I'm racin' down the stairs
I open the door, she's right there
And she's like how you like my hair?
I'm like that bob looks fly
But them lips, oh, my
Can't wait 'til you plant that kiss on me
[Bridge]
(On me, on me, on me)
She kiss on me (On me, on me, on me)
