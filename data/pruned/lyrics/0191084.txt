I guess you think it's fun to laugh at her expense
And point out each mistake she makes in front of all your friends
You figure she'll let it go by 'cause she loves you so
But you know

[Chorus]
Every time you throw dirt on her
You lose a little ground
She slips a little further away
Each time that you put her down
A lady like that can come here and get
Somebody who'll know what he's found
And every time you throw dirt on her
You lose a little ground

[Verse 2]
It's hard to bite my lip but I'm not saying a word
I'll give you all the rope to hang yourself that you deserve
You might be ahead of me in her heart today
But that's okay

[Chorus]
Every time you throw dirt on her
You lose a little ground
She slips a little further away
Each time that you put her down
A lady like that can come here and get
Somebody who'll know what he's found
And every time you throw dirt on her
You lose a little ground
You might also like[Chorus]
Every time you throw dirt on her
You lose a little ground
She slips a little further away
Each time that you put her down
A lady like that can come here and get
Somebody who'll know what he's found
And every time you throw dirt on her
You lose a little ground
