You can go where you like
You can be what you want
Dont follow my path
Cause i pull these stunt
And i roll these blunts
These life is tough but its 10x tougher
When you play in these streets, Just stay in school
And chase your dreams
Stay away from these street
I made mistakes
That you dont have to make
I made them for you
You a king
Treat these women like queens
Let them know they voil
And you friends
Just choose them wisely
Every body ain't loyal
Dont follow no paths
Gotta make your own
Everything ain't for you
Be your own man
Stand on your own two thats how you learn
And i love you but i won't spoil you you gotta earn
Everything on this planet just gotta focus plan it
Put your plan in motion go get it
Cause ain't nobody goin hand it
Forreal!

Verse 2

Young man your mother
You respect that woman
Man she gave you life
And when you dream
You dream the biggest
Live the way that you like
Cause in this country
You dont have no limits
Only limits is the sky
And when you speak
Let em know you ain't weak
Look a man in the eye
Stay true to your word
Cause its all you have
Your word is bronze
Look out for others
But take care of you first
Cause when they gone its just you and your family
So put your family first
And when you run into problems
Talk to the big man cause it works
Forreal!
Chorus
