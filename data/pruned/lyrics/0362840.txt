When I feel enraged
Fighting to keep cool
Jumping out my skin
To rip their heart in two
She watches me
She touches me
She calms me down
With her black perfume

[Chorus]
Black perfume! Baby I love you
Black perfume! Let me breathe you
Black perfume! Let us fly awayyyy
With your black perfume

[Verse 2]
Ohhh honey come on
Let's lie on the couch
One candle will do
End of tunnel light
Touch me
Kiss me
Break through me
With your black perfume
You might also like[Chorus]

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
I gave up everything
For you my girl
You were my heroine
Why you hurt me now?
Is this the end?
I'm going mad
Ride me once
With your black perfume

[Chorus x2]
