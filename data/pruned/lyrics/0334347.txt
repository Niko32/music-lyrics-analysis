Give me one more chance to make it up to you
Give me one more chance to show what I can do
Let me prove to you that my love is strong
Will you come back home? That is where you belong

[Chorus]
Oh baby, will you give me one more chance?
Will you give me one more chance?

[Verse]
Well, the sun will not shine and it refuse to rain
And I bang my heard, but I feel no pain
Then I tell myself that I could start anew
But I know darn well it all depends on you

So if you hear this song, you might change your mind
And give a thought to me, I will not be hard to find
And I will promise you to do the best I can
Change my evil ways and be your loving man

[Pre-Chorus]
