We can see through them blinds homie
Let it go, let it go, let it go








Setbacks happen refocus , rethink and reemerge
Words of of a wise man  thats more than spoken word
Got knocked down but i   stood back up /
Never stop kas tell a hater back up
Hustle like a beast trying to get my racks up  /
With a team like mine tell a bitch back up

Im so damn rocky
People  calling me cocky
But if i make where im going ain't not human can stop me
If you don't believe me in u tell me who will ?
The world don't push your dreams lil homie  there more convicted to steal
Not falling asleep at the wheel I got my foot on the pedal /
Had to leave some dudes behind they wasn't raising there level
Why cross the finish line if you ain't claiming the medals
No moral victories in life you either acheieve or you settle
Snap you pictures  get your kodak on
Adventure in my world  and watch you mine get blown

Im a young hustler no better ways to explain
Going against the grain are you not etertained ?



Hook repeated







Life throws a curve batter up
I like watching my haters get mad as  ,,,,,
They don't want to see you sail clear /
Where im from we make it happen ain't no fail here
Small city big dreams of a super star /
My circle small fuck your  entourage \no half stepping we rolling hard
Investing smart  you waste on fancy cars
