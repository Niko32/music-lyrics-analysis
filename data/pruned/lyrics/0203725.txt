Got a boss on me like a snake on a frog
There's gotta be more than what I've got
On this big old piece of rock
I want a little umbrella and a patch of sand
Coconut drink and a reggae band
This just might be the place where I get off

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I want a day in the life of a summertime song
Sail away with the Malibu rum
Sail along, sail all the way, yeah

[Chorus]
Let the scorching sun and the salt in the sea
Burn the skin right off of me
Come on everybody and sing along
It's a summertime song

I might pierce my ear and bleach my hair
Get a tattoo on my derriere
Right now I don't really care
What anybody else might think
I'm gonna dance to every song I can
So I can show off my new island tan
While I wave my hand and raise my drink
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]
