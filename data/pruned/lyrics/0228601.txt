And the world looks alright again
Then the clouds fill the skies
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't win

My love never meant much to you, dear
For to you I was always a friend
Oh why did I fall?
You have no heart at all
Sometimes you just can't win

I can't live like this any longer
Not knowing just where I stand
I know I should't care
But, sweetheart, it don't seem fair
Sometimes you just can't win

And then when the sun shines the brightest
And the world looks alright again
The clouds fill the skies
You can't believe your eyes
Sometimes you just can't winYou might also like
