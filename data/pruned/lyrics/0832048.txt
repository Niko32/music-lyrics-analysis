Here in this desert they're reciting my last rights
The smell of these halls brings temporary comfort
As oxygen flows through my blood
El Coraz'n was poisoned tonight
She's on her 8 of 9

When half of all your prayers are insincere
The other half are lies

Here is this watermark under this bridge
The point where it crested
Rolled back and drifted into the sea
I climb from this wreckage
As the smoke begins to clear from my lungs
The closest of close calls has happened tonight

It's time that I made things right
For the first time since the last time
Let this moment of clarity
Lift this curse that has been cast upon me

So appreciate the good times
But don't take the worst for granted
Because you only get so many second chancesYou might also like
