Lately I don't get to sleep at night
I cry to the moon "Don't come back too soon"

Lately I've been coming back to life
Lately I've been dreaming I can fly
I smile at the moon, a hint of understanding starts to grow
I'm not alone
I'm not alone

All that remains are the scars and the stains
But it's time to put them all away
You're not alone
I'm not alone

All that remains are the scars and the stains
But it's time to put them all away
You're not alone
I'm not aloneYou might also like
