She says gee, I feel crap
I shouts Oi! whats up?
Ya stink, I think yer drinkin too much

She's gone, Yippee!
I turn on, the TV
But there's a snag, coz she's a bag
She's back to nag & torment me

(Chorus:)
Iddlely aye ay, iddley aye oh...
She makes me cringe, she makes me scream
Iddeley aye oh, iddley aye ay
How comes my missus is so mean
SHE'S OBSCENE

SHE'S OBSCENE

She says get, yer hair cut
She won't let me have a hairy nut
Complains, about nowt
No brains, insane shes a strain a pain
I could do without. WITHOUT

SHE'S A BA...
(Guitar bit)

You've guessed
It's all down to all down to you
My baby is a battleaxe
And now there's nuthin' I can do...

(Chorus:)
