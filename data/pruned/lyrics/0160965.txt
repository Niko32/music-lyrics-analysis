Baby I love you
But you get on my fuckin' nerves
Acting like you don't know;
You got exactly what you deserved
Girl

[Chorus]
But you want more than that
It's all yours so its cool
The Sun and The Moon

[Verse 2]
Girl you deserve lovin' all day
And you deserve fuckin' all night
And you deserve more than I have
I want that for you, alright
Is it alright

[Bridge]
Its all yours
What's yours is mine
We're all one

[Chorus]
But you want more than that
It's all yours so its cool
The Sun and The Moon
You might also like[Outro]
And the moon was full
And my eyes turned black
Memories claw through
This was all my fault
Now you're changing too
The night belongs to you..
The Sun and The Moon
The Sun and The Moon
The Sun and The Moon
