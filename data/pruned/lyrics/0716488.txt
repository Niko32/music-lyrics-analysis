Happy in my harvest home
Walking the floors with the ghosts all alone
Happy that I'm made of stone
The grief that I cause is my cause to atone

Now black is a color, black is my name
When I need something to help me chase the devil away

[Chorus 1]
The house on fire
The fraying high wire
Nothing to say
The sky so grey
I reap, I sow
My harvest, my home

[Verse 2]
Happy in my harvest home
Walking the floors with the ghosts all alone
Happy that I'm made of stone
The grief that I cause is my cause to atone

Now black is a color, black is my name
When I need something to help me chase the devil away

The house on fire
The fraying high wire
Nothing to say
The sky so grey
I reap, I sow
My harvest, my home

[Chorus 3]
The house on fire
The fraying high wire
Nothing to say
The sky so grey
I reap, I sow
My harvest, my home
