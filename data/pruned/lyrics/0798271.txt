Walking on barbed wire
You got excuses
But my heart says a liar
My bag of chances
You emptied out
More give than take
Takes a toll on how you love someone
'Til it comes undone

If you wanna know why the tears ain't falling
You wonder why I don't reach for you
You spill your heart like it's your lifeline
Like it can save you from the truth
Eleventh hour come to Jesus
Beg and plead and can't you feel it
My white flags been thrown
I'm already gone

You look surprised
That I've let go
That thread that held us
Has finally broken
Sometimes a hurt
Can cut so deep
With every promise
Every time I believed
I hit the ground
You've let me down

If you wanna know why the tears ain't falling

It's too late to right what's wrong
