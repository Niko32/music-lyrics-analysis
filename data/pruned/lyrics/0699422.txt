All them fantasies that you’ve been havin'
I don't want to come off like I’m braggin'
But girl
You need this and you gotta have it
This young mans ain't never lackin'
I love it when that ass is clappin'
You freaked out while the camera flashin'
All of this lust
Pacing yourself girl there's no need to rush
Tempted to touch, tempted to touch
I told you before, girl theres no need to rush

[Hook: slxda]
Chill while i take care of that body
You ain't gotta move a muscle
We got the playlist on shuffle
I just need for you to chill baby
Chill baby [x4]
I just need for you to chill baby
Chill baby [x4]

[Verse 2: slxda]
That wine bottle sittin' on ice
Brown stew chicken with side of the rice
We got greens
Just tryna stay lean
Sip lean young nigga just tryna get right!
I got greens so we can take flight
You might also likeGrind that
I’ll roll it
That reefa goes great with some pussy & fifa
Face in the pillow, yo ass in the air
Speaking of air girl i just need a breather
Just caught up i had to get that back
3 rounds proves all the stamina
She fucks like a pro like she schooled an amateur
