You make me smile
You make me sing
You make me feel good's everything
You bring me up
When I've been down
This only happens when you're around

[Chorus]
And I can't go on this way
With it stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you

[Verse 2]
I wanna fly
Away with you
Until there's nothing more for us to do
I wanna be
More than a friend
Until the end of an endless end

[Chorus]
And I can't go on this way
With it stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you
And I can't go on this way
Feelin' it stronger every day
But being too shy to say
That I really love you
Ooh, ooh, I doYou might also like
