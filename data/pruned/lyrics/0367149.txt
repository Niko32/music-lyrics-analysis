Gun you down in the street, put you to sleep
Don't worry about it, I'll take care of your family
A knife for your wife, garrote for your son
A bullet for your daughter at the end of my gun
I just want you to know before I let you go
And put this last bullet hole in your soul
I'm the thing from your bad dreams
No one could ever see this being your last night on these cold dark streets
I'm the monster under your bed, the one in your head
Call me Stallone, call me Judge Dredd
These bullets coming out of my gat are just hot lead
On the ground, I'll leave your body spread
As I feel the last heat from your heart beat
A sense of power rushes over me
I'm the king of the gutter back alley murderer you might of hearda
I feel you shutter motherfucker did I stutter?

[D-Nasty]
Shut your mouth cause I'm about to murder you
Your mom so scared she's screaming for the
Neighbors but they don't hear
Now I knocked her ass down and tied her to the chair
She gets to watch as the rest of your air
Leaves your lungs through the holes that I put in em
She's crying so loud so I tell that bitch to shut up
I pull out my knife and hold it to her throat
Now all I see is fear in her eyes
She didn't even get to say her last goodbyes
Your dad and your sister finally came home
I didn't even hesitate and gave em one to the dome
Now I'm walking the hood they all know my name
Don't fuck with me 'cause you'll get the same
Some call me a gangsta some call me a thug
But all I see is a cold blooded murderer
You might also like[Outro]
Don't call me a gangsta or a thug
I'm just a murderer dressed in your blood
Don't call me a gangsta or a thug
I'm just a murderer dressed in your blood
