You see the bait
I know you want a bite
So why procrastinate
Come on

Everybody knows that yeah I'm kind of shy
I'm not the kind of girl that who can ever approach a guy
But I wanna find a way to get you to notice me

I got a 4 wheel drive, 55, from eyes
But maybe you can handle these because I'm Free

Single, sexy, and sweet, making my own money, looking for the right party
And if your free
Scoot your best thing at me, if you like what you see
Maybe I'll let you share, My fantasy

When I told you that I don't need a man in my life that ties me down
And don't want a playa that can kiss all over town
Who's these girl stripping all over my Mercedes seat
I can stand a man who thinks he looks better than me
I'm looking for a brother who likes to have fun
A fly gentlemen that who knows how to please

Last thing I need is a man who's soft
He better get it on up, and break me off
Some body fly high, who's 6'5
Who's shy that's the kind of man I need because I'm free

Maybe I'll let you share, My fantasy

If your having a good time, just let go and don't be shy, come on yeah(oh yeah)
If your down to do anything let's sing this song together
Be free, come on and be free with me

Single, sexy, and sweet, making my own money, looking for the right party
And if your free
Scoot your best thing at me, if you like what you see
Maybe I'll let you share, My fantasy

Would you like to dance? Get loose
There's a party in the house tonight
Everybody if you feel all right
Put your hands together

Oh boy you look so good to me
