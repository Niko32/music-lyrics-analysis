How many butts can you fit in the backseat?
How many cans can you throw in a floorboard?
Mama's credit card and your brother's I.D
6 bodies, one bed good lord

[Chorus]
Checkin' in to a good time
Checkin' out and all is so fine
Under a blue sky, red sunshine, salt and green lime
White can Miller Light
Goodbye to the real world
Hey, hey, little shot girl
Gimme the whole tray
Baby what's your name
Party in my place, gets you ahead, hey
That's what this week's all about
Checkin' in, checkin' out

[Verse 2]
Alabama baby pulling up in a black jeep
Two Georgia boys holler hey what's up
Parking lot, piggy back burnin' the bare feet
They're coming in hot somebody best get the door

[Chorus]
Checkin' in to a good time
Checkin' out and all is so fine
Under a blue sky, red sunshine, salt and green lime
White can Miller Light
Goodbye to the real world
Hey, hey, little shot girl
Gimme the whole tray
Baby what's your name
Party in my place, gets you ahead, hey
That's what this week's all about
Checkin' in, checkin' out
You might also like[Bridge]
Checkin' in, checkin' out all the bars and cars up and down the beach
Checkin' in with your mama now and then knowing she can't sleep, hey
Yeah, hold it down
Hey mama, yeah, I'm being good
No, we ain't partying, it's the TV

[Chorus]
Checkin' in to a good time
Checkin' out and all is so fine
Under a blue sky, red sunshine, salt and green lime
White can Miller Light
Goodbye to the real world
Hey, hey, my little shot girl
Gimme the whole tray
Baby what's your name
Party in my place, gets you ahead, hey
That's what this week's all about
Checkin' in, checkin' out
Checkin' out
