On a hill overlookin' the town
But time has left a wreck where once there was beauty
And soon the old house will tumble down
But when the leaves start to fall in autumn
And the rain starts to drift from the dream
And there's an old old man who walksd in the garden
And his head is bowed in memory

They say he built the mansion for the love of a woman
And they planned to be married in the fall
But her love withered in the last days of summer
And the house stands empty after all
But when the leaves start to fall in autumn
And the rain starts to drift from the dream
And there's an old old man who once walked in the garden
And his head is bowed in memory
And there's an old old man who once walked in the garden
