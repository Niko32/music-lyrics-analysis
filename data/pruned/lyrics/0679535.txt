Dont try, you'll find
Was not your fault
The goal, reach out
The choice is yours to find

[Verse: 1]
They question how I came up
They say I'm disturbed
I hit em with a brain fuck
And say I'm superb
What would mother say if she heard my songs?
Does my father know the monster I could be?
All I talk about is love, drugs, heartbreak
Wouldn't know the things that's happy to me
But I try

[Sample]
Dont try, you'll find
Was not your fault
The goal, reach out
The choice is yours to find

[Verse: 2]
Different women every day
Lust, is that what they deserve?
Well the one that I loved left
And that made it worse
Too many songs about me hoping
For a love that I wish I could find
Too many hearts that I have broken
Too many women that have broken mine
But I try

Dont try, you'll find
Was not your fault
The goal, reach out
The choice is yours to find
