Yo! Do you like when the gamers [?] ? Do you want to be a part of this?
That’s what you call me for? Well…

But I’ve just something that I got ignore

[Verse 1]
I know we’re all in this business kind of thing
We too much talking, trying to convince
The rest of the world, that you are the best
You are the one; everyone is on a TV show screen

And I’m the star, pick me up
I am the star pick me up
I am the star pick me up
I am the sta-ar, a-ar !

[Hook]
And everything is, all okay until
The point when you start, to pretend that you
Want me to be your real friend
Tell you, everything, but something’s telling me that you playing game!

[Verse 2]
And all you want me to do
Is to connect you
With everyone that I know
Drop a nice work on you
But I know what you are, actually all abo-ou-t
All that you want is to be closer to the sta-ars !

And everything is, all okay until
The point when you start, to pretend that you
Want me to be your real friend
Tell you, everything, but something’s telling me that you playing game!

[Bridge]x3
I know what’s all your plan it’s all in your head, but please
Don’t involve friendship in your game
Cause it would hurt too much when it comes out, it’s a fake
I prefer that they [?] straight your head (You playing games)

[Hook]
And everything is, all okay until
The point when you start, to pretend that you
Want me to be your real friend
Tell you, everything, but something’s telling me that you playing game!

[Outro]
And I feel the whip my heart, I’m feeling whip my heart! (You playing games)
And I know, I’m right, I know I am right, I know that I am right! (You playing games)
Something’s telling me, something’s telling me, I’m feeling whip is my heart, (You playing games)
Something’s telling me, something’s telling me, right, I know that I am right (You playing games)
