I am the employee of the month
I've got a badge upon my front
So strike me down, down, down
So strike me down, strike me down
I am the employee of the month
I've got a badge upon my front
So strike me down, down, down
So strike me down, strike me down

I've got a doped up style
Ain't afraid to use it
I'm abusing music
Mummy what we prove it
Love them sticky carpets
That make your shoes stick
So move that ass
Like you used to move it
You give pretty honeys
Oh I love your blue bits
Love the smell of flowers
So spark up your tulips
Think I hang around
And then wait to the new bits
I'm a dirty little pervert
And on top of it ruthless
You might also like[Chorus]
I am the employee of the month
I've got a badge upon my front
So strike me down, down, down
So strike me down, strike me...

I'm a back alley cat
So watch my eyeballs
Same that do the kind of thing
Thats makes you drop your bibles
Peaceful life I waiting to unlock your vinyl
So killing that score like you're homicidal
[?????] you're with 'em just a passin' you by
I'll be the type of guy to make wanna laugh and cry
I make you fear to live, you're more afraid to die
Just wanna feel a little ??????? inside

[Chorus]
I am the employee of the month
I've got a badge upon my front
So strike me down, down, down
Strike me down, strike me down
I am the employee of the month
I've got a badge upon my front
So strike me down, down, down
So strike me down, strike me down
I ain't a human being
Barely half a person
So wave 'em in the air
Until your arms are hurtin'
And you can't be certain
Which bar I'm lurkin'
At, I'm employee of the month
Cause I'm the hardest workin'

Standing in the corner making eyes at me
Yeah, have you got a match yet or maybe three?
He goes strike me down, you can strike me down
Strike me down, down, down, down
Come join me in the gutter, yeah there's room for two
We've only got the best, I got a room with a view
It goes strike me down, you strike me down
You strike me down, down, down, down

[Chorus]
I am the employee of the month
I've got a badge upon my front
So strike me down, down, down
So strike me down, strike me down
I am the employee of the month
I've got a badge upon my front
So strike me down, down, down
So strike me down, strike me down
