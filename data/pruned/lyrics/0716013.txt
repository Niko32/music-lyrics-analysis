That the world was dying
That the birds outside
They never sing for us
Winter time and snow
And the pain should deny it
My blood runs cold
They never sang for us

[Chorus]
Hollow
Hollow
Not empty

I guess we'll go outside
And face the slaughter
Of a daily life
And a world getting smaller
And shortly you were here
My little daughter
And now the birds can grow
And the winter doesn't matter

[Chorus x2]You might also like
