You asked me something but i didn't hear it
My mind was somewhere else again
I still care a great deal my friend
The sun was burning my back
The wind was chilling my face
We've all become hypocrites since then
The things that meant so much still do
I felt so lonesome, all of a sudden
I couldn't breathe, i couldn't talk to others
Then i recalled a certain thing you said
And it really made me laugh, again
The sun was burning my back
The wind was chilling my face
We've all become hypocrites since then
The things that meant so much still do
People still say things they don't believe in
And you could puke every time you hear it
Imagine all those phony crooks we've met
Our kids will one day meet with theirs
The sun was burning my back
The wind was chilling my face
We've all become hypocrites since then
The things that meant so much still do
The river got all icy and frozen
You watch the things you gave your life to, broken
Sometimes we're punched below-the-belt
So you stand and build it up againYou might also like
