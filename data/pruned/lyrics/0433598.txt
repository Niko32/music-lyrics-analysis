Some people got that (je ne se quoi)
I don't know
Where you just have to look back (two times, two times)
A walking invitation (into the fire)
Or higher ground
A mystical combination (it's like, it's like)

[Pre-Chorus]
Deep wide eyes
Reflecting the planets in the outer space
Swaggering down the block
Like Saturn's rings around your waist
God was good to you
But she done went an extra mile
He slapped on those heart-shaped lips
Of which when they form a smile
I'm in…

[Chorus]
Ooh, trouble
Ooh, trouble
Ooh, trouble
Ooh, trouble

[Verse 2]
Words have not been spoken (you might hate Jazz)
I may not be a big fan of Beethoven (it's alright, alright)
I have been captured (you hold the key)
In those lovely hands conducting this rapture
(Lord have mercy)
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy, Cherie
What have you conjured up in me?
Me nah ac’ a fool for nobody
Lord have mercy on me
Q'est que tu me fais, cherie
Lord have mercy on me
Lord have mercy

[Chorus]
