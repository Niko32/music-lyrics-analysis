He like damn flames, we just warming up
I'm like, "Fuck that, lil' bro, set fire to 'em", haha
Lil' baby pussy been A-1 since day one
You already know that, yeah
And she got ass by the pound, she should be on a mound
I said throw that

[Verse 1: Teeflii]
She been A1 since I met her
She gon' stir me up if I let her
I told her, if she want it she can get it right here, Annie
Whispered in my ear while I'm up in it
Hands all on her belly, her eyes are [?] to the back of her hair
She said she down for whatever, however, whenever

[Pre-Chorus: Teeflii]
I'm gon' put it down, give her what she need
So she make it bounce right in front of me
And it hold me down when she in the streets
Her sex, her sex
Her sex is fire, fire, fire, fire
Her sex, her sex, her sex is fire

[Chorus: Teeflii]
Yeah, this is something she'll do, something she'll do
She climbing on top of me, yeah, she get the best of me
'Cause that's something she'll do, something she'll do
She get money and she independent, hell yeah, hell yeah

Drinking, drinking, you gon' catch a [?]
Weak niggas always actin' thirsty
She don't wanna do it with nobody else

[Pre-Chorus: Teeflii]
I'm gon' put it down, give her what she need
So she make it bounce right in front of me
And it hold me down when she in the streets

[Chorus: Teeflii & Skeme]
Yeah, this is something she'll do (Say what), something she'll do (She, she)
She climbing on top of me, yeah, she get the best of me (Yeah)
'Cause that's something she'll do (She do it), something she'll do (She do it)

[Verse 3: Skeme]
Lil' baby pussy been A1 since day one, you already know that, yeah
And she got ass by the pound, she should be on a mound, she throw that
I wanna murk it, it look picture perfect
Like damn, man, this here is a Kodak
She got that fire, I don't even smoke
But I might split a swisher and roll that
I might even pass to the homie like you gotta get it
Tell her drive it, get it, gotta watch
When she get to popping with it I just hop up in there
Switch position, man, I gotta get on top
She got that run it, that come back
That wet with the water fountain, man, I want that
She got that flight, it's so tight and so right
[Bridge: Teeflii]
Her sex is fire, fire, fire, fire
Her sex, her sex, her sex is fire

[Chorus: Teeflii]
Yeah, this is something she'll do, something she'll do
She climbing on top of me, yeah, she get the best of me
'Cause that's something she'll do, something she'll do
She get money and she independent, hell yeah, hell yeah
