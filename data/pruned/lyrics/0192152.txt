So, what's it gon' be? Haha
L-U-P-E, Joy
Come on, woo

[Verse 1: Joy Denalene]
There's so many things to say right now
I got so much on my mind
Look at what is going down
How much higher can we climb?
The system that we're living in
Depends on poverty and greed
But people don't need charity
It's justice that we need

[Pre-Chorus: Joy Denalene]
There's disrepair
Hey, it's surrounding you and it's worse than it's ever been
(We'll overcome) We'll overcome the things they do, yeah
(We're halfway there) Halfway there 'cause we know the truth
But living is another thing
(We'll overcome) Overcome the things they do
Lift your voice and sing

[Chorus: Joy Denalene]
A change is coming our way (It's coming our way)
Step-by-step and day by day
And we'll live, we'll live by all that we say
Step-by-step, now come what may

There's war all around the world in the name of democracy
Can't tell the rouge from the just when they bring hypocrisy
I see my sisters on the move, making sure we all contend
Must've lost something on the way, we reduced ourselves again, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Joy Denalene]
There's disrepair
Hey, it's surrounding you and it's worse than it's ever been
(We'll overcome) We'll overcome the things they do, yeah
(We're halfway there) Halfway there and we know the truth
But living is another thing
(We'll overcome) Overcome the things they do
Lift your voice and sing

[Chorus: Joy Denalene & Lupe Fiasco]
A change is coming our way (Sing it, sing it; it's coming our way)
Step-by-step and day by day
And we'll live, we'll live by all that we say (Yeah, uh)
Step-by-step, now come what may (Uh, now)

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Before we go forth, we gotta take 'em back (Back)
So we can know where to dig
'Cause if we never know what happened in the past
Then we can never know just what it is
If we don't do it for us, we gotta do it for our kids, kids
So they ain't gotta relive
See, there's so much happening, it ain't gon' get fixed
With singing and rapping and we gotta take action
And turn that preach into practicing
'Cause what happened back then will be right back again (Woo)
But each one teach one
'Cause we only as fast as the last one straggling, so help 'em out
[Bridge: Joy Denalane & Lupe Fiasco]
(Step-by-step, day by day)
(Uh) I said it won't be long, it won't be long
(Step-by-step, come what may)
Sheesh, I feel it coming on strong, yeah (Come on)
(Step-by-step, day by day)
Ooh, we gonna overcome
(Step-by-step, come what may)
(Uh) As long as we are one

[Chorus: Joy Denalene]
A change is coming our way (Sing it; it's coming our way)
Ooh, step-by-step and day by day
I said we'll live by all that we say, yeah
Step-by-step, now come what may (People)
A change is coming our way (Said it's coming our way)
Step-by-step and day by day (Ooh-ooh, you know it's coming)
We'll live by all that we say (I know it's coming)
Step-by-step, now come what may
