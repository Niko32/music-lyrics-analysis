Whoa yeah!

[Verse 1]
Ready, set, go, light the fire below
No time left to rest my head
Time for action, gonna start the show
I'll do my sleeping when I'm dead
Catch your breath because I won't slow down
I'm going to kick it up instead

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know what I'm doing
And I know what I want

[Chorus]
Gimme life for the takin'
Gimme love till I'm shakin'
Gimme rules just for breakin'
Because it's never enough, never enough, never enough

[Verse 2]
People waste time on their hopes and dreams
Fate is always in my hands
Only way I know is the way I'm gonna go
When others sit and make their plans
I don't stop till I make it to the top
Don't need no one to understand
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I know what I'm doing
And I know what I want

[Chorus]
Gimme life for the takin'
Gimme love till I'm shakin'
Gimme rules just for breakin'
Because it's never enough, never enough, never enough

[Bridge]
(You can see what what you wanna believe)
I'm gonna live the life I live
(Gonna try till the day I die)
'Cause I'm giving all I've got to give

[Chorus]
Gimme life for the takin'
Gimme love till I'm shakin'
Gimme rules just for breakin'
Because it's never enough, never enough

Gimme life for the takin'
Gimme love till I'm shakin'
Gimme rules just for breakin'
Because it's never enough, never enough
[Outro]
No, it's never enough, never enough
Give it to me, never enough, never enough
Never enough
