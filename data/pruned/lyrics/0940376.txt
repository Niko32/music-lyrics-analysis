In my own way, I'm a believer
In my own way, right or wrong
I don't talk too much about it
It's something I keep working on
I don't have too much to build on
My faith has never been that strong
There is a man there in that building
He's a holy man, they say
He keeps talking about tomorrow
While I keep struggling with today
He preaches hellfire and brimstone
And heaven seems so far away

[Chorus]
I do believe in a higher power
One that loves us, one and all
Not someone to solve my problems
Or to catch me when I fall

[Verse 2]
He gave us all a mind to think with
And to know what's right or wrong
He is that inner spirit
That keeps us strong
In my own way, I'm a believer
But not in voices I can't hear
I believe in a lovin' father
One I never have to fear
That I should live life at its fullest
Just as long as I am here
