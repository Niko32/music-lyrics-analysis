When I wake I see someone's silent eyes
Would you stay for a while, keep good company?
Did you know what it means to be underneath?

When the light comes I'll be gone
When the morning is upon you
When the evening sees the daylight coming through
I know that they're gone

If I know, you will know where I'm going to
If you go, I won't know where you're going to
To the ground I can see where you pass your eyes
When the sun settles in I'll say my goodbyes

When the light comes I'll be gone
When the morning is upon you
When the evening sees the daylight coming through
I know that they're gone

When the evening sees the daylight coming through
I know that they're goneYou might also like
