The words you say make me cray
You can't talk to me like that
It makes me wanna be your baby

[Chorus]
I know you want me
But it's such a drag
It's just not in a girl to act like that
So why do you always want to bring it back on me

You can't talk to me like that
It makes me wanna leave it all behind
Please don't talk to me like that
It's starting to mess with my mind

[Chorus]
I know you want me
But it's such a drag
It's just not in a girl to act like that
So why do you always want to bring it back on me

When it's all said and done
You know I don't want no one
But you, and only you
Do you want me, too
You might also like[Chorus]
I know you want me
But it's such a drag
It's just not in a girl to act like that
So why do you always want to bring it back on me

You can't talk to me like that
The words you say make me crazy
Please don't talk to me like that
It makes me wanna be your baby
Your baby
