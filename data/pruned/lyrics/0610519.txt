I've got a quarter in my pocket
Won't you tell me what I should do
Should I put it in the phone
So I can come crawling home to you
Or should I put it in the jukebox
And play another heartbreak song
I'm leaning towards the latter
And I really hate being alone

[Verse 1]
Gonna flip it in the air
Gonna watch it fly
If it's heads I might love again
If it's tails I'll cry

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Here I am again
On the same ol' stool
With the same ol' question
And the mind of a fool

[Chorus]
You might also like[Outro]
Well I've got a quarter in my pocket
And I really hate being alone
