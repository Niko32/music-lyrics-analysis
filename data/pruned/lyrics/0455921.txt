You can't get rid of me that easy no
Not without a fight
Your cool and collective approach is appealing yeah
You've got it down just right
You should put a blindfold over my eyes
And tape my mouth shut

[Pre-Chorus]
When every word I say might as well be might as well be my last thought

[Chorus]
No I don't want to make this an issue
I just want to pick back up right where we left off
So we don't get caught up again
[x2]

[Verse 2]
You left me pictures just to tease me
Or maybe out of spite
You used your body to confuse me
Your hips swing just right
How do I control myself around you
I need to be locked up

[Pre-Chorus]
You might also like[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You're a wolf in sheep's skin
Teeth can tear me limb from limb
Do you have the room to spare me in your heart of hearts
I'm a wolf in sheep's skin
Teeth can tear you limb from limb
I don't have the room to spare you

[Chorus]

[Outro]
Pick back up right where we left off
So we don't get caught up again
