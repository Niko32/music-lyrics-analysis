I wonder why people never ask for help
I don't know why things taste better burned
I've got the time, but I don't wanna learn

Sicken me
Somebody
Show yourself
Run away

I love it
I hate it

Hey. Hey. Hey
Are you paranoid?
Paranoid you're in a daze?
What do you know anyway?
Your misery only a phase

Are you paranoid?
Paranoid you're in a daze?
What can you do anyway?
Your misery only a phase

I'm all alone
Lucky I'm by myself
I figured out why no one ever asks for help
I don't know why people think they're not worth each others time
But I don't gotta learn
