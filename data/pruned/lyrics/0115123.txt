So magnetic when we love
Inside there is a rush
So hypnotic
Don’t pull the plug

Love don’t really make a difference
Don’t be afraid of the distance
I don’t wanna lose the frequency
I don’t wanna let the feeling leave
Ride the wave to hit the limit
Get the sounds of the space and
I don’t wanna lose my frequency
I don’t wanna let the feeling leave

Turn me on for sonic love
I want you to hear the way you make me feel
When you turn me on
Take it high, till you get it right
I can feel it build, frequency is real
When you turn me on

Vibrations set the tone
Stimulation makes it flow
Your signals find a hard room
Send a message, make it known
Love don’t really make a difference
Don’t be afraid of the distance
I don’t wanna lose the frequency
I don’t wanna let the feeling leave
Ride the wave to hit the limit
Get the sounds of the space and
I don’t wanna lose the frequency
I don’t wanna let the feeling leave

Turn me on for sonic love
I want you to hear the way you make me feel
When you turn me on
Take it high, till you get it right
I can feel it build, frequency is real
When you turn me on

Turn me on for sonic love
I want you to hear the way you make me feel
When you turn me on
Take it high, till you get it right
I can feel it build, frequency is real
When you turn me on
