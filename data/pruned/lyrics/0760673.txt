If you ain't, let me recommend one
I've already read that Tulsa telephone book through thirteen times
If you don't know any last names, it ain't much fun

Readin' that Tulsa Telephone Book
Can drive a man insane
Especially if that girl you're lookin' for
Has no last name
I've got to find her and tell her
That I don't want our love to end
So I'm readin' that Tulsa Telephone Book again

I was in Tulsa and didn't have anything going
She lived in Tulsa and didn't have anyting on
She said "My name's Juanita"
I said "My name's J.B."
I awoke the very next morning, and she was gone

All the Tulsa operators know my voice know
They've got to know just how long I've been alone
If you meet a girl named Juanita with some ribbons in her hair
Could you tell her that she's wanted on the phone?

Readin' that Tulsa Telephone Book
Can drive a guy insane
Especially if that girl you're lookin' for
Has no last name
I've got to find her and tell her
That I don't want our love to end
So I'm readin' that Tulsa Telephone Book again
