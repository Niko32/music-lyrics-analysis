Look at you thinking you couldn't live without em now look at you living
Look at you doing way better and all outta ya feelings
Yo edges  came back and yo ass is getting a lil bigger
Girl fuck that lil nigga
Girl fuck that lil nigga
Cause you don't deserve that, girl you don't deserve that, girl you don't deserve that
And you can do better
You don't deserve that, you don't deserve that, you don't deserve that
And you can do better

[Verse 1]
You fell in love with a fuck nigga, now you feel like you can't trust niggas
You the one that went and stuck wit em, I know you knew he was a fuck nigga
Why you let em do you like that, why you let em do you like that
You leave once and be right back, why you let em do you like that
You let em cheat on ya, you let em beat on ya
You scared to be single huh, you need to leave homie
He call you ugly names, yo mind ain't feeling the same
Your going through bodily change, girl get back on yo game
Friends try to tell you leave him, but you feeling like you need him
He can cheat right in yo face and you still gon believe him
Then a good man come along, and you push em away (push him away)
You push em away (you push him away) you gotta do better

[Chorus]
Look at you thinking you couldn't live without em now look at you living
Look at you doing way better and all outta ya feelings
Yo edges came back and yo ass is getting a lil bigger
Girl fuck that lil nigga
Girl fuck that lil nigga
Cause you don't deserve that, girl you don't deserve that, girl you don't deserve that
And you can do better
You don't deserve that, you don't deserve that, you don't deserve that
And you can do better

You deserve flowers on Tuesday, not a single but the bouquet
I know you had a real long day, let's just pop open this D'usse
Not no Netflix and chill, baby that ain't what it is
Need a real boss in yo corner, help you pay some of them bills
I see that stress on yo shoulders, girl let me take it off
You let them fuck niggas hurt you, now you won't fuck with a boss
I see the pain in yo eyes, when I look at you
Know you tired of all these niggas, baby just hear me through
I got a PlayStation at home, I ain't finna play with you
Tell me what you want, whatever you need I'll do
I don't think you know your worth baby
I can't sit back and watch you hurt baby

[Chorus]
Look at you thinking you couldn't live without em now look at you living
Look at you doing way better and all outta ya feelings
Yo edges came back and yo ass is getting a lil bigger
Girl fuck that lil nigga
Girl fuck that lil nigga
Cause you don't deserve that, girl you don't deserve that, girl you don't deserve that
And you can do better
You don't deserve that, you don't deserve that, you don't deserve that
And you can do better
