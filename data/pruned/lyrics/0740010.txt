Baby I’m a candle, you’re a hurricane
Now I can’t wait to be blown away
And I get the feeling that you feel the same

Most people dream about a love that’s safe and sweet and endless
The kind that find forever in the magic of a first kiss
But I like love a little rough around the edges
I like it when it’s reckless
Yeah I like it when it’s reckless

Like a car with no brakes running straight down hill
Baby that’s the way that you make me feel
Scare the hell out of most, but I love the thrill
So hop in honey, won’t you come and take the wheel
Take the wheel

Most people dream about a love that’s safe and sweet and endless
The kind that find forever in the magic of a first kiss
But I like love a little rough around the edges
I like it when it’s reckless

Ooooh I love it when you shake me
Love it when you break me
Girl I got to have you now
Set me on fire
Build me up and burn me down
