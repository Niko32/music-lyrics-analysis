Giving up on everything
With every cynical breath
The air keeps thickening
The spite will fill our lungs
Till we spit it out proudly
And are you happy with what you've become?
Can you tell me loudly
Whether you stand tall and raise your voice together
Let the youth stand tall to raise their voice together
Let the empire fall
The culprits tarred and feathered
Give it one last go before you give it up
All of the silent shout out to me
If you're not gone
All of the dormant rise up for me
Yeah only you can save us
Only you can save yourself
Can we revile in our lack of shame
We think it makes us better than
All the masses we forgot had names
And we are still all partying
As we all perform the global hysterectomy
The scars we form appear the very second we turn our backs on this old human race
All of the silent shout out to me
If you're not gone
All of the dormant rise up for me
Yeah only you can save us
Only you can save yourself
Shout out to me if you're not gone
Shout out to me if you're not gone
Let them hear you cross the distance
Let them know of your resistanceYou might also like
