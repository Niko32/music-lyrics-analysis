There's a melody in my head
And I ain't stopped humming it
Since I saw your face

There's a feeling I can't forget
It started with you
Kissing me that way
And there's no end in sight

Like an Oklahoma wheat field blowin'
You've got my heart in motion
And I'm gone

I'm the pinks
And you're the reds
Just like this sunset
We belong
And there's no end in sight

[Chorus:]
How high is the sky
How long is time
With you it's how I'm spending mine
Like there is no end in sight
You might also likeI wanna laugh
I wanna live
I'm gonna love you like there is
Like there is no end in sight

[Verse 2:]
So kick your shoes off
Stay awhile
Ain't nothing here
But stars for miles and me

We're standing on the edge of something
Not afraid of jumpin' in deep
And there's no end in sight

[Repeat Chorus:]

I'm gonna love you
I'm gonna love you

[Repeat Chorus]

I'm gonna love you like there is no end in sight
I'm gonna love you like there's no end in sight

There's a melody in my head
And I ain't stop hummin' it
Since I saw your face
