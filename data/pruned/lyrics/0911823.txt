Why did you spend your good fortune on me?
Why did you spend your good fortune on me?

[Verse 1]
Did you leave me to suffer
Just to shuffle and breathe
Did you pick through the litters
And just settled on me?
Am I just play thing
For the wind like a leaf?
Or did you lead me exactly
Where I need to be?

[Chorus]
Tell me, why did you spend your good fortune on me?
Why did you spend your good fortune on me?

[Verse 2]
I can tell you of sorrow
Of losing, of pain
I can cry through the levee
If it'd washed you away
I can give you one reason
Two reasons or three
I can tell you 'bout heartache
No [?] can grieve
You might also like[Chorus]
So why, did you spend your good fortune on me?
Oh why, did you spend your good fortune on me?

[Verse 3]
I can tell you a story
Tell it simple and plain
Tell your life is a candle
It flickers and I'm a flame
So if I give you one reason
For me to say what I'm saying
I'd say that you are the answer
To my question every day

[Chorus]
Saying why, did you spend your good fortune on me?
Tell me why, did you spend your great fortune on me?

[Chorus]
Why, did you spend your good fortune on me?
Oh why, did you spend your greatest fortune on me?

[Outro]
On me
On
On me
Ooh
