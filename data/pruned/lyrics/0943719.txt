Camera

[Verse 1]
Let me recreate the world for you
There is no beginning and no end
The camera is gonna be your best friend

[Verse 2]
Let me show you what I can do
People turn into objects and in the end
The camera is gonna be your best friend

[Chorus]
I'll take a picture of the world
I'll take a picture of the world

[Verse 3]
You become the camera becomes you
Celebrate a new pseudo-event
The camera is gonna be your best friend

[Verse 4]
The more it tells, the less you know
It takes so long to comprehend
The camera is gonna be your best friend
You might also like[Chorus]

[Refrain 2]
Camera obscura
(la, la, la, la, la, la, la)

[Outro]
I'll take a picture of the world
I'll take a picture of the world
(la, la, la, la, la, la, la)
