Millionaires, bitches

[Verse 1]
Middle finger in the air if your pussy's tight
All the boys are getting hard down to fuck tonight
One thing on my mind-mind, drink the city dry-dry
Do it all in the stall one boy at a time

[Pre-Chorus]
Pull it, pull it, pull it up and pull it out, pull it, pull it, pull it
Flashing, flashing cameras all around
You want this bomb ass pussy
Smashing, smashing bottles, doing lines
Pop-poppin' pills and getting high
I'm so fucked out of my mind

[Chorus]
I do what I want, middle finger in the air
Gonna party, party, party like a millionaire
I'ma dance like a slut and I don't even care
Gonna party, party, party like a millionaire
Millionaire, like a millionaire
Tonight I'm gonna party like a millionaire

[Verse 2]
Gettin drunk as fuck, my lips are sippin' potion
You can kiss my ass, yeah in slow motion
We ain't even near done, time to have some real fun
Need a fix, big and thick, holla if you have one
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Pull it, pull it, pull it up and pull it out, pull it, pull it, pull it
Flashing, flashing cameras all around
Come smack this bomb ass booty
Smashing, smashing bottles, doing lines
Pop-poppin' pills and getting high
I'm so fucked out of my mind
(Ha, where are we?)

[Chorus]
I do what I want, middle finger in the air
Gonna party, party, party like a millionaire
I'ma dance like a slut and I don't even care
Gonna party, party, party like a millionaire
Millionaire, like a millionaire
Tonight I'm gonna party like a millionaire

[Bridge]
I can do it over here, I can do it over there
Do whatever I want, middle finger in the air
Who wants that bomb ass pussy?
You want that bomb ass pussy
Who's got that bomb ass pussy?
I've got that bomb ass pussy
White girl with the bomb ass pussy
I don't give a, I dont give a (I don't give a fuck)
I don't give a, DGAF til we die
I don't give a, I don't give a
I don't give a fuck 'cause I'm a Millionaire

[Chorus]
I do what I want, middle finger in the air
Gonna party, party, party like a millionaire
I'ma dance like a slut (A whore) and I don't even care
Gonna party, party, party like a millionaire (Get crazy)
Millionaire, like a millionaire
Tonight I'm gonna party like a millionaire
Millionaire (Cash), like a millionaire (Money)
Tonight I'm gonna party like a millionaire

[Outro]
