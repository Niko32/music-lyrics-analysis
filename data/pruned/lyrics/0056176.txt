She still got her wisdom teeth
I get that brain from her mouth
She's got that cornbread pussy
From da-da-down south
She gets here in a Jiffy
When I ask her to cum
Yeah, she gives me a stiffy
And her mom gives me gum
Girl grind that pussy on me
First you got to skate it
My dick is the half-pipe
But half is understated
You girls need a helmet
Don't forget to put the strap-on
Pop your booties in the air
So I can get my slap on

I'm in the Clean Plate Club
I let my tounge do the dishes
You leavin' lots of scraps
Because your food ain't delicious
Pitt's on the first floor
Money's up in the loft
I'm a non-lethal talker
Hear me speak airy-soft
I'm as sharp as they come
But my dick is a gun
I can't get any flyer
I've got that pussy-for-hire
I've got a flow so strong
I could bust up your levee
Rollin' in my silver leather
Seat-warmer Chevvy
You might also likeDamn, bitches want to put
Their name on a plaque
Because we fucked way back
And now they're seeing my raps
Girl, stack your stuff on me
Like I'm a push-cart
If I'm hearin' your puss fart
Then I'm toppin' the puss chart
Cleaner than the green
That the doctor you're seein'
Is making while I'm taking
All the panties you pee in
I'm in your house
Looking through your hamper
Then I see some pampers
Oh, I got to scamper; I'm out of here!

[Hook]
Out of my dick
You make the Price is Right, chick
Because you prune my dick wet, bitch
Sit back up on my dick
I stay up all night
Using 'hood words
When we fucking in the 'burbs
Thank the Wright Brothers
Because I'm so fly
[Verse 2: Frank Lloyd Wright]
She be missing front teeth
I got a claim on her mouth
She got some shiny little gums
On the North and the South
She cuts off my circulation
When I ask her to cum
She lives in Myakka
I think horses are dumb
Girl, grind that butthole
Like a shih-tzu on carpet
I'm talkin' 30-square wet
Girl, you should probably just mop it
Girl brother wears a helmet
And momma wear a strap-on
Eatin' out her pussy
While I chew on her tampon

I'm into steam-baked clams
Pescatarian wishes
You're covered up in jam
It's fair-trade and delicious
The pool's on the third floor
Brownies up in my dresser
I'll be twisting up your legs
Like a Mexican wrestler
*your panties are purple and your heels are a trip*
If I'm normal and young
Then my dick is a blimp
Makes me thirty pounds lighter
Helps me climb like a chimp
Now pop it. Pop it
Like a balloon at the fair
You could win you a pair
Splash into my dunk tank
Throw your legs in the air
Now stop it. Just stop it
OK, I give in
I'll slip my finger inside
My bus is late to a party
And you can't have a ride

[Hook (x2)]

[Outro: Frank Lloyd Wright and Richard Wright]
Girl, I'm blowing in your ears
Like death-by-stereo

I'm puttin' starch on your pussy
So I can make it look
Crisp, clean, and professional

Let's put some Vaseline on your lips, baby
Let's make you a star
