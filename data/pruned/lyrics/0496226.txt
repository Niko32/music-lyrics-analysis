It's HH2S I'm dressed to impress
I'm fucking all these basics that are pinning me on pinterest
My rhymes like sex while camping: that's fucking in-tents
Got the rap god, and we got the rap king
But I'm more into destroying
So you can call me Shiva
Cut you with my cleaver
Taint all the minds of you little Beliebers
INNE NET NET NET look I'm Chance the Rapper
The seventh seal of the impending rapture
Yeah I'm 2 Scarvez and I ball every day
I would have 2 Chainz but they're on layaway
My bank account has no commas, but I got decimals
Hipsters won't let me play at their music festivals
Nowadays I'm so God damn poor
I can't afford to buy weed anymore
So how can I be cool if I'm not blowing doja?
You keep on talking shit I'm going to keep my composure
If Kanye is Yeezus, I'm 2 Scarvez the Revelator
Send this bitch up like it's a mother fucking elevator
King Louie with the Drilluminati
I'd love to say I'm gangster but I'm just Johnny
The kind of Hindu Catholic
Pissing off the Baptists
Want to hear more? Well then listen to me rap this
You might also like(Smokes weed)

I'm a punk rocker
And society mocker
I'll kick you in the balls and call it soccer
Or futbol, not Americano
Chilling in the murder capital, rep Chicago
And I know I come off aggressive n personal
But I got more flow than a progressive commercial

His Holiness: 2 Scarvez, Fuck around and get scarred
