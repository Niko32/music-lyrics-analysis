Look at this world, it's filled with worn out faces
Forgotten places and nothing changes
Whatever happened to that new day rising
We're just surviving when living is dying

[Pre-Chorus]
Aren't you tired of being let down?
Another day, another shakedown

[Chorus]
I'm with you
When hope is gone and all you want is the truth
I'm with you
You carry on when they say, "It's no use"
I'm with you, I'm with you

[Post-Chorus]
If I got one thing, I got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose
I'm with you

[Verse 2]
I walk in shadows that seem all familiar
I've read the papers, life forsaken
A vacant store front, I'm one more for sale sign
Down on main street you just walk by
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
How many times we gotta break down
Before somebody's gonna shout out?

[Chorus]
I'm with you
When hope is gone and all you want is the truth
I'm with you
You carry on when they say, "It's no use"
I'm with you, I'm with you

[Post-Chorus]
If I got one thing, I got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose
I'm with you

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
When hope is gone and all you want is the truth
I'm with you
You carry on when they say, "It's no use
They say, "It's not use"

[Post-Chorus]
If I got one thing, I got something to prove
We all got nothing if there's nothing to lose
I'm with you, I'm with you
[Outro]
I'm with you (I'm with you)
I'm with you (I'm with you)
I'm with you (I'm with you)
