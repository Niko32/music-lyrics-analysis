You used to be mine, but you went away, left me so far behind
I find strangers when I look for friends of mine in this ghost town

Ghost town
Hoped for so much more than in most towns
But if hoping's what you're for, you sure let me down
Down in the cold, cold ground, ghost town

As far as good times go, you have known the best
But you've settled, ah, for so much less
You're just a shell of your former self
You're just a ghost town, oh yeah, yeah

Ghost town, you sure have changed
Not for better, but for worse
I am afraid of this ghost town
Dried up, blowing away, ghost town
Oh yeah
Oh yeah

Ghost town
I got to get away from you or I mightâ€¦I might become a ghost too
Before the city gates I'll beat the dust off my shoes, from this ghost town
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, whoa

There's more in this world for me than just a ghost town
Oh, I've got to be free from this ghost town
You scare the hell out of me, ghost town

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh
