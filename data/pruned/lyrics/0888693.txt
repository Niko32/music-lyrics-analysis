(Dont Wanna Know, I Dont Wanna)
Youre Mine To Hate What Youve Grown To Be
(Dont Push It Baby, Dont Push Me)
Youre Not The Same Since All The Friends Weve Lost
And Heaven Is Not Enough
So Listen To What I Have To Say Before Youre Without Me

Theres Not A Better Place Id Rather Burn
You Told Be But Ill Never Learn
Theres Not A Better Place Id Rather Burn
You Told Be But Ill Never Learn
Then Your Heart

Teenage Dreams Come Into Us
(Dont Bother Me, Dont Bother)
All Over Me Theyre Forced To Breathe
(All Over Me Theyre Forced To Breathe)
Dont Try To Save Me Cause
Its Me That Must
And Baby Its Just A Gun
So Listen To What I Say With Your Heart Above Her

Theres Not A Better Place Id Rather Burn
You Told Be But Ill Never Learn
Theres Not A Better Place Id Rather Burn
Theres Not A Better Place Id Rather Burn
Then Your Heart
Then Your Heart
