Beats, bass, rhythm breaks, guitar strum, record spun
Hats, que pasa, me casa su casa, now tell me what I'm after

[Verse 1]
You'll not find a style like this
When I was a youth I listened Miles Davis
Lost in space like Neil Armstrong
I used to hum melodies from Louis Armstrong
Last night I fell asleep in my home
Had a little dream bout Nina Simone
I laid down and before I came round
She told me "Get Up", I ain't Mr. James Brown

[Hook]
Drop drop, drop drop another one
Drop drop drop, drop drop another one
Drop drop drop, drop drop another one
Whoa-whoa yeah-yeah
Drop drop drop, drop drop another one
Drop drop drop, drop drop another-nother
Drop drop drop, drop drop another one
Whoa-oh-oh whoa-oh-oh-oh

(All that jazz)

[Verse 2]
Back in my teenage years
Walking down the street, Walkman inda me ears
Stand clear, final spin spree
Dancing on the ceiling like Lionel Richie
Just thrust tha pelvis in me
Bust a few moves like Elvis Presley
Let me turn up the mic a fraction
Let me see if you can dance like Micheal Jackson

[Verse 1]
