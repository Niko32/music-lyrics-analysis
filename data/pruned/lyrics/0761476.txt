So you put your cards on the table
You're here, you're willing and able
Do you really understand the challenge you've set yourself
You know I want to adore you
Can't believe how life was before you
I must apologize, please understand I'm so demanding

[Pre Chorus]
Don't need to be cruel
I never felt that with you
Trouble is I'm a danger to myself
Don't want to push you away
I really want you to stay
Until I figure this out, won't you

[Chorus]
Please, come take me over
Let me leave me for awhile
Maybe when I'm older
I'll understand the reason why
Understand the reason why

[Verse 2]
Every day is here to remind me
That the past is always behind me
Something I can never change but I won't let it hold me back
You arrived just in time
Now I know I'll be fine
I'm not ashamed to say you truly are my inspiration
You might also like[Pre Chorus]
Don't need to be cruel
I never felt that with you
Trouble is I'm a danger to myself
Don't want to push you away
I really want you to stay
Until I figure this out, won't you

[Chorus]
Please, come take me over
Let me leave me for awhile
Maybe when I'm older
I'll understand the reason why
Understand the reason why

[Bridge]
Might not be forever
Baby whatever
We've got today, won't you

[Chorus]
Please, come take me over
Let me leave me for awhile
Maybe when I'm older
I'll understand the reason why
Please, come take me over
Let me leave me for awhile
Maybe when I'm older
I'll understand the reasons why

[Outro]
Understand the reason why
