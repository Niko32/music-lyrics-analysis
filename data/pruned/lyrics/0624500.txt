Seems like we were right
But you always have a problem with everything
Appreciate your advice
But sometimes I have trouble managing
Now that I'm paying attention
I see how beautiful you are
But when you spend so much time together
That image can get so dark

[Chorus]
When you're gone
I miss you like I did when we were first together
No one in this world could ever hold me better
Just tell me when you're coming home
When you're gone
I miss you like you took a piece of me with ya
Didn't think I'd care that much did ya?
Just tell me when you're coming home

[Verse 2]
Seems like we were right
But today I woke up on the wrong side
I need silence to keep me right
Otherwise today won't be nice
I wanna laugh with you again
Just like you are my best friend
But friends can always leave
And we're too close
And too close is never easy
You might also like[Chorus]
When you're gone
I miss you like I did when we were first together
No one in this world could ever hold me better
Just tell me when you're coming home
When you're gone
I miss you like you took a piece of me with ya
Didn't think I'd care that much did ya?
Just tell me when you're coming home

[Bridge]
I'm not alone
Until you leave me
Now I won't get to sleep tonight
Cause you're not here beside me
When you're away
It's never easy
You make it all alright
I miss you

[Chorus]
When you're gone
I miss you like I did when we were first together
No one in this world could ever hold me better
Just tell me when you're coming home
When you're gone
I miss you like you took a piece of me with ya
Didn't think I'd care that much did ya?
Just tell me when you're coming home

But she also said that, she'd been waiting for someone to write with
That is, fulfill exactly what she was looking in terms of production and the beat
And then once you add Jimmy and Sam into the equation to write melodies and songs
It's like, yeah, power team
It's just good timing as well, you know?
She's just ready to it, that's what it is
She doesn't need to do this, look she wants to and its great, you know

[Spoken dialogue: Guy Lawrence of Disclosure]
It's the reason people like Mary are so successful
Is that, they're just, they're not afraid to just change what they do completely
