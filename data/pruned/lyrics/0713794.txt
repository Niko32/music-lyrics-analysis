Don't you know
Don't you know
Don't you know
It's the real thing, girl

[Chorus: New Edition, Ralph Tresvant, Ricky]
They say it's popcorn love
But it's more than that to me
Popcorn love
Just wait, they will see
It's popcorn love
Every morning, noon and night
Popcorn love
Don't you know, don't you know
It's the real thing, girl

[Verse 1: Ralph (Mike)]
When we go on those special dates
We're always holding hands
We're never, ever late
You're on my mind all the time

(I keep thinking)
I keep thinking
(Thinking)
I keep thinking
(I keep thinking)
Thinking of you
You might also like[Chorus: New Edition, Ralph Tresvant, Ricky]
Popcorn love
But it's more than that to me
Popcorn love
Just wait, they will see
Popcorn love
Every morning, noon and night
Popcorn love
Don't you know, don't you know
It's the real thing, girl

[Verse 2: Ralph (Mike)]
I go to school
And then I come straight home
The first thing that I do is call you on the phone
The things you say
A-really make my day
I need you, girl
In every kind of way

I keep thinking
I'm just thinking

I keep thinking (Thinking)
Thinking (Thinking)
Thinking (Thinking)

[Bridge: New Edition]
That's right
That's right
That's right
That's right
Ah!

[Rap: Ronnie]
"P" is for her personality

[Michael]
I said the "O" is for originality

[Bobby]
And the other "P" is
For the perfect love she gives to me

[Ricky]
The "C" is just 'cause she loves me

[Ralph]
And the "O" means she's the only love I got

[New Edition]
And the "R" and the "N"
Our love will never end
[Bridge: Ralph]
Well, I know
I know it's the real thing
Because she told me so
And I know
I know it's the real thing
And I'll never let her go

[Ronnie]
I just got to
I just got to have your love

[Outro: New Edition & Ralph]
Popcorn love
But it's more than that to me
Popcorn love
Just wait, they will see
It's popcorn love
Every morning, noon and night
Popcorn love
Popcorn love
But it's more than that to me
Popcorn love
Just wait, they will see
It's popcorn love
Every morning, noon and night
Popcorn love
Popcorn love
But it's more than that to me
Popcorn love
