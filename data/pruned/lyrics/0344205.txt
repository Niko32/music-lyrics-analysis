While you wait for the others to make it all worthwhile
All your useless pretensions are weighing on my time
You could beg for forgiveness as long as you like
Or just wait out the evening, you'll only bleed me dry
Yes, you'll only bleed me dry

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll ask you kindly to make your way

[Chorus]
And what was left?
A perfect cleft
We all fall through

[Verse 2]
While you wait on the answers that I'll pretend to find
Keeping up with the motions still occupies our time
You could hope for some substance as long as you like
Or just wait out the evening and always ask me why
Yes, you'll only bleed me dry

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll ask you kindly to make your way

[Chorus]
And what was left?
A perfect cleft
We all fall through
You might also like[Outro]
And all we want
And what was left
And all we want
And what was left
