Make this night last forever
For on the morrow, I leave for battle--

I may survive
And I shall return to you
But come the morrow, I leave for battle--

And if I die, just remember I love you
And you'll always be mine
Let us warm up this cold night together
Come the morrow, I leave for battle--

Until tomorrow
Let me love you forever
For come the morrow, I leave for battle--You might also like
