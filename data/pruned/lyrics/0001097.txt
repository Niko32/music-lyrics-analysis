MC Chris owns
I wanna go to an MC Chris show
But he doesn't tour so in the meantime
I'm gonna memorize all of his lines
MC Chris owns
I wanna go to an MC Chris show
But he doesn't tour so in the meantime
I'm gonna memorize all of his lines

I spell "word" with a three, name's MC
Other rappers flow weak like window unit A/Cs
Latinas on my penis, Japanese on they knees
I love all the ladies as long as they 18
I got bling up the ying, a plethora of Porsches
I'll say anything cause my mouth is remorseless
Even the Source says my hip hop's a vortex
Leave horse heads on door steps, my mic checks cost Corvettes
The strobe light explodes white as I step on the floor
The bar keep knows the code so he throws me a Stroh's
Weak MCs decompose, cause they know I can flow
Like Wessel comma Zam through Coruscant corridors
Humidor filled with Stoges, filled with 'dro
Like 90210 it's filled with the word "bro"
Fuck the lexicon of octagons, I'm all about go
These amateurs got catheters I'm all about prose by pros

I'm lit like a Branch Davidian
I'm what's left of the lithium in Cobain's cranium
I fill Wembley Stadium
I'm once-bitten, twice-shy call it pyromania
When I roll up in Kashyyyk, I roll three Jedis deep
The fleet of peeps that I creep all got vests underneath
There's no need to beleive in the heat that I keep
The squares that I (bleep), or the heiresses I freak
It's embarrassing to me, I'm like kerosene it seems
Or D-R-E-W-B with incendiary schemes
Blowing up making cream, I am just like Howard Dean
When I scream I get red, I get mean
Can't believe you be buyin' what I be shuckin' and jivin'
Fuck it if I am the next big thing with promotional tie-ins
I am just a cartoon-making rapper, you think that I'm lying
Everyone bust a move like it is a rave in Zion
My self-aggrandizing and deprecation keeps 'em guessing
Call me Venus Flytrap cause my DJ's Howard Hessman
Word 'em up yo, word 'em up yo
I just let the rap game out of a choke hold
