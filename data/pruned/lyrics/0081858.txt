Look I don’t want time from you no more
Didn’t want beef with you no more
I didn’t want beef, now I want war
I just wanted love, didn’t you want more
And fuck that little nigga cause he ain’t me
Cause I was down for you and a baby
And I know that you hate me
But I just thought that maybe
There was hope for us maybe
But maybe not
But maybe not
But maybe not
But how could you leave me
You make that shit seem easy
But even though you need me
Even though you love me
But even though I hate you
And even though you hate me

[Chorus: Lamont Lawrence]
You know this shit could’ve been worse
Know this shit could’ve been worse
Shit could’ve been worse
I hope you hear these words
Don’t know why this shit didn’t work
And you knew that this shit would hurt
Just like poison to a nigga, you a curse
Cause I had this love for you first
And I don’t know why this shit didn’t work
Through the good and the bad shit could’ve been worse
You know this shit could’ve been worse
Know this shit could’ve been worse
Shit could’ve been
You might also like[Bridge: Lamont Lawrence]
You think you know me right
Say I don’t love you right
Say I don’t love you right
But these niggas just can’t love you like...

[Chorus: Lamont Lawrence]
You know this shit could’ve been worse
Know this shit could’ve been worse
Shit could’ve been worse
I hope you hear these words
Don’t know why this shit didn’t work
And you knew that this shit would hurt
Just like poison to a nigga, you a curse
Cause I had this love for you first
And I don’t know why this shit didn’t work
Through the good and the bad shit could’ve been worse
You know this shit could’ve been worse
Know this shit could’ve been worse
Shit could’ve been
