Nobody knew you were hurting me
As long as you were mine, no one else could see

[Chorus]
But you left me, then you left him, and he told the things you do
But if you'd love me, I'd never told on you

[Verse 2]
I was loyal to the pain that you put me through
Even the one who took you never knew

[Chorus]
But you left me, then you left him, and he told the things you do
But if you'd loved me, I'd never told on you

[Chorus]
But you left me, then you left him, and he told the things you do
But if you'd love me, I'd never told on youYou might also like
