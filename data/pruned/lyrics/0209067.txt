Pardon my swag, must have heard that I am the best man, Flow ice cool no school but I’m fresh man. Little [?] do it better than the rest man, flow so dope but you would have never guest man
Ha Ha
Listen to my mouth reach, flow like a champ now my talent down in South Beach. Fan base growing up, girls keep showing up, money in my palm, I’ am the bomb yeah I ‘am blowin' up
I ‘ma grind like a skate team, y'all don't understand I’m the man when I ‘am 18, other rappers hate me probably because I win right or sound tight on the mic but my skin white
I mean really I’m incredible, feasting off the beat like the instrumental edible
Work a forward chance now I get it in my [?] [?], I’m just trying to get it, work it out like a bench press
[Verse 2]
Ok I’m back like the ladder of [?], yes I’ am a native boy with an actual flow
I mean I give it and go I mean I got it in left I mean I live like a pro so I ‘ma die with the best
Ah flow [?] lyrically I’m killing them, I ‘ma [?] threw a crowd so now I’m [?] them
Tell me turn it down, that’s a no keep rocking. Pants made custom I need these pockets
Slow it down because I’m too fast cruise with the crew in the coupe so I flew past
Spit like the flu so I true that my flow sick, I ain't gonna stop going hard like a stone brick
Now I’m feeling kinda strong man, tear on my face because I murder ever song man, putting every verse in the [?] feeling [?] man, kill a beat quick got my money feeling long man.
I ain't lying I’m the truth, best white youth spitting up on YouTube.
I cut it sharp man I do it for the hatchet, good to the hood man, I do it for the ratchets
[Outro]
