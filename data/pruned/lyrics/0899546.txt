I'm shit out of luck and I wanna go home

Hell on my left side, a bitch on my right

I freeze in the middle, it's weird alright

It's a very strange town

They wanna show me around

Come on and feel the pain

I'm back in the devil's lane

The sheriff is fat and the preacher is thin

Gotta break out before they suck me in

I run to the station, look for the train

The track is empty, did I lose again?

Don't wanna hang around here
You might also likeI start shaking with fear

They wanna fill me with lead

Now here is what they said:

We're glad to have you here in Suckerville

Where the girls are dressed as truckers

And the boys are down to kill

Give me all the liquoir I can drink

Cause the boys are turning faggots

When the girls go down to kill

Yeah, yeah, yeah what a mess I'm in

Shit out of luck and no chance to win

This game of evil here in suckerville

Goodbye now Suckerville
I can't move too fast right now

And I'm born to thrill

Alright, what an ugly night

Look out little honey it fucking kills

Goodbye Suckerville
