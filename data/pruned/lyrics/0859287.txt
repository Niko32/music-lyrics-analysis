There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
You can hear the sounds of lovers in love
You know what I mean
Just the two of us
And nobody else in sight
There's nobody else and I'm felling good
Holding you tight
Now listen, listen carefully
Closer now and you will see what I mean
It isn't a dream
The only sound that you will hear
Is when I whisper in you ear I love you
For ever and ever, ya
There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
You gonna hear the sounds of lovers in love
There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
All over the world
You gonna hear the sounds of lovers in love
There's a kind of hush
All over the world tonight
There's a kind of hushYou might also like
