The flash of a distant camera
Reconnecting thoughts and actions
Fragments of our missing dreams
Pieces from here and there
Fall in place along the line
Disappearing between you and me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Life is changing everywhere I go
New things and old both disappear
If life is a photograph fading in the mirror

[Chorus]
All I want is a song of love
Song of love to sing for you
All I need is this song of love
To sing for you

[Verse 2]
On the floor where daylight dances
With the ones that missed their chances
When they couldn't let it show
Lies the land of sweet surrender
Like a dream, it might have ended there
But we didn't even know
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now forever we will live as one
Floating in love's atmosphere
If love is a piece of dust shining in the sun

[Chorus]
All I want is a song of love
Song of love to sing for you
All I need is this song of love
To sing for you

[Outro]
Song of love
Song of love
