Cause nobody knows my name
'Til we start pickin' and a-singin'
Home sure sounds good today

Well, I wanna go home
Yeah, I wanna go home
Yeah, I wanna go home
I wanna go home

I grew up there in the mountains
And I got moonshine in my veins
My grandma gave me my first guitar
My pa gave me his last name

Well, I wanna go home
Yeah, I wanna go home
Yeah, I wanna go home
I wanna go home

And I ran barefoot up the holler
In the shadow of the pines
With my bothers and my sister
We cut our teeth on homemade wine

Yeah, I wanna go home
Yeah, I wanna go home
Yeah, I wanna go home
I wanna go home
You might also likeI can hear my mother callin' at the fall of the night
And I can hear my daddy yellin' cause my brothers are in a fight
Yeah, the innocence of my childhood keeps runnin' back again

Yeah, I wanna go home
I wanna go home
Yeah, it's time go home
I wanna go home

I was born here in Kentucky
That's where my soul will rest in peace
I've been all around this world
There's no place that I'd rather be

Yeah, I wanna go home
Yeah, I wanna go home
Yeah, I wanna go home
I wanna go home
