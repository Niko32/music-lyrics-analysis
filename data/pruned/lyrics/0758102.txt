What makes you hurt?
What makes you smile?
What calms your nerves?
What drives you wild?
I wanna know
I wanna understand
What it takes to be your man

[Verse 2]
What's your favorite color?
What's your favorite song?
If I sang it to you
Would you sing along?
I need to know
I gotta understand
What it takes to be your man

[Chorus]
What you want? What you need? Baby, tell me everything
There ain't nothin' I don't wanna know
'Cause all I want, all I need is just you here with me
Baby, let me know so that I can be what it takes to be your man

[Verse 3]
What makes you cuss?
When do you pray?
Is your daddy your hero?
What would your mama say
'Bout what I need to know
I need to understand
What it takes to be your man
You might also like[Chorus]
What you want? What you need? Baby, tell me everything
There ain't nothin' I don't wanna know
'Cause all I want, all I need is just you here with me
Baby, let me know so that I can be what it takes to be your man

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
What you want? What you need? Baby, tell me everything
There ain't nothin' I don't wanna know
'Cause all I want, all I need is just you here with me
Baby, let me know so that I can be what it takes to be your man

[Outro]
Oh-oh
What it takes to be your man
