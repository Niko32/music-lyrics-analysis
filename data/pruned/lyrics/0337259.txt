Met an old man yesterday
Next to me on a westbound plane
He said, "I was married sixty years
I swear it feels like she's still here"
Then he took out a picture

[Verse 2]
Staring at that black and white
The tears filled up in his eyes
I said, "You were a lucky man"
He said, "I feel like I still am"
When he told me her name
I heard myself say

[Chorus]
I want to be Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's world
Somebody's day and night
One and only girl
A part of a love story
That never has an end
You know that's what every woman wants to be:
Somebody's Chelsea

[Verse 3]
He made me laugh when he talked about
Their first date and her father's doubts
He said "Even as her hair turned gray
She still took my breath away"
And that it never changed with time
That's when I closed my eyes
You might also like[Chorus]
I want to be somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's world
Somebody's day and night
One and only girl
A part of a love story
That never has an end
You know that's what every woman wants to be:
Somebody's Chelsea

[Bridge]
And when we finally said goodbye
I hugged him and said, "I'll never forget
How you showed me what it means -"

[Chorus]
To be somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's world
Somebody's day and night
One and only girl
A part of a love story
That never has an end
You know that's what every woman wants to be -
And I wanna be
Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's Chelsea
Somebody's Chelsea
