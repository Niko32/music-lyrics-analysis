Naw no one does

When I get mad Im like a evil clown that's high on LSD
I escape from all reality it's like murder of the 4th degree
I could slap hoe now u thinkin' I'm colder than 40 below
It goes in to history like the black plague so long ago
People say hes a nice person and this angers so out of place
But then they realize that i just broke your whole mutha fuckin face
Then blood starts runnin' and my rage is like a deadly sin
Its like i have an evil twin but i dont this rage comes from within
Im so hostel that i fill up the whole damn hospital
Ill make u fell so small like a little tiny ass hair follicle
When im mad im in a different place it gets so diabolical
Make u think i just went crazy but ive always been this way
If u stay u might not ever get to see your children at play
Dont be surprised if you see your life flash before your eyes
Ill take u so deep in the woods that no one will ever hear your cries
Im not delirious im just psychotic no im not like you im not generic
I am a science experiment gone horribly rite im a prototype
They try me on pills that make me mellow but all it does is keeps me hype
Bitch fuck your life imma go slit your neck with a steak knifeYou might also like
