Yo, Bugzy Malone
Grime daily
Look

[Verse]
Tweet tweet, they say that I'm the newest in talent
Bugzy Malone is the next to blow
They don't know that I've got a chemical imbalance
Suttin' like Jekyll & Hyde
Spent my teenage years battering guys
Are you forgetting that Bugz is violent?
Make man skatter and hide
Tweet Tweet, Sophie off Coronation Street
Said she can't keep my song out of her head
Imagine me like a minor celeb
This time last year, finding my head
Now I just can't keep girls out of my bed
I used to run them down
Now I gotta keep my phone on silent instead
Tweet, fuck that I don't like updating Twitter
But still nobodies moving quicker
I've been writing bars for a year
And they're already saying I'm the leading spitter
I leave MC's feeling bitter
And if you thought Swaggerman was a big CD the new ones even bigger
Look, I'm off my head
To the grime scene I'm like Shawn of The Dead
My niggas looking on IPP
If he get's locked up informer fi dead
I don't care if your talking to feds
Turn into the devil
This time pull out a tool I keep under my bed
Guaranteed man'll start losing their head
I'm moving fast, hunger
Make bare doe, thunder
Yoo, I'm soz bro this phone is sending me under
Yo, I can't really speak I'm, who's this?
What do ya mean? Private number!
You find that funny, maybe
But money is time, pay me
I get things done A.S.A.P
And that's why I'm on grime, daily
I got fans now, that rate me
But other MC's hate me
Cause they see this ting as a race
If it was then I'd be running at Usain speed
I've been shattering records, lately
Have a look at the connect 4 countdown
Then try telling me that I'm lazy
I'm the joker but I'm no clown
The new CD is out now
I done it in three weeks, I swear down
I'm the popular kid in my town
But I'm not someone to be played with
I've been rapping and spitting for ages
But its never gonna be your time
Cause nowadays Bugz is a hit with ladies
The wickedest ting since garage and grime
Sicker than Mike Tyson in his prime
Your like Mike when he got sat on was crying
And if I said I could fight with Tyson
Then I'd be definitely lying
Cause he don't care about tiger and uppercut
He will come and put me on my backside
I'll be laid out on a relaxed vibe
But I'll definitely come back that night
Holding a tool that you can't bite
Turn into the devil
This time pull out the tool that I keep in my boot
Make everybody in the room see a bright white light
Light up the road, cats eyes
Make a ship sink, capsized
You're one of those guys that might fight
By the time you've made up your mind
Get over here, woom ping
Lights out, night night
I'm just not one of them guys
I'm not an MC this is real life
Let me drop back in
Bugzy Malone I gets it cracking
I started this ting totally hard
For the last four bars I've been totally slacking
They wanna know, now they wanna know, never gonna happen
I spit fire, call me a dragon
And these days I'm switching alot
Cause I know nuff man jump on a bandwagon
And i'm constantly turfing them off
Sonic Boom
Good job I'm like Ricky The Hitman Hatton
They wanna know, now they wanna know, never gonna work
Cause this bad boys never been a jerk
And welcome to the concrete jungle where MCs get kicked to the kerb
I know set man are never gonna learn
That I'm Bugzy Malone, you've had your chance
It's my turn!You might also like
