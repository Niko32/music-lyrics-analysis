I like Charlie Daniels and I love big John Cash
And I think Waylon "Wall-Tosser" Jennings is a table thumping smash
Playing with Marshall Tucker Band was as good as smoking grass
But anyone that don't like Hank Williams, they can kiss our ass

[Chorus]
Cause I think what they done was well worth doin'
And they're doin' it the best that they can
Oh, but you're the only one that you are screwin'
When you put down what you don't understand

[Verse 2]
Now I love all them Allman Brothers, Merle Haggard and George Jones
Shotgun Willie Nelson, and them rockin' Rolling Stones
Everything the Eagles do, I'm in love with Linda Rondstadt
But anyone that don't like Hank Williams, they can kiss our ass

[Chorus]
'Cause I think what they done was well worth doin'
And they're doin' it the best that they can
Oh, but you're the only one that you are screwin'
When you put down what you don't understand

[Refrain]
Oh, I ain't sayin' that he was the first or the last
But if you don't like Hank Williams, you can kiss our assYou might also like
