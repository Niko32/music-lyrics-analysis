Girls, sounds and colors (x4)
All this groovy love that they gave to me
I'm thriving off the love that they gave to me
And all these groovy pills
That all these girls are taken
They thrivin' of those pills that they've taken

[Verse]
Hi love, I'm almost there
I'm better off dead, you can leave me there
Die for love, die for love
Even if they say that they gon' take you down
You know they have no way of takin' you down (down x3)

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Ow, hey
All these groovy pills that they've taken
Ow, hey
Thriving off the love that they've gave to me

[Verse 2: Kid Cudi]
Hay, bad with the good, I'm zooted stuck for good
So how should it feel to zone in control when you go so smooth
Her groove is exactly where I move to
To where my minds tell me to
No matter who claim I'm a fool
Beyond bein' cool
What it could be, interpiece when I smoke a piece to forget about me prayin' on my knees
I'm zonin', I am gone an, my demeanor is slumped and I talk like a slug, slow motion
Fuck me baby even if lately
I been flippin' over other shit
See boo lately, I've been on some other shit thinking maybe whether you be on some baby other tip
Trust me, tired livin', feelin' like a custy
I'ma make the whole world love me
You might also like[Chorus]

[Bridge]

[Verse 3]
Hi love, I'm your drug
I'm your drug, acid drops to your love
You lost your mind?
I lost mine too
I left mine in the nineties how 'bout you?
Everything you do, everywhere you go
Got to do with limos

[Outro: Ricky x Cudi]
Girls, sounds and colors, yeah (x4)
Girls, sounds and colors, oh oh (x4)
All this groovy love that they gave to me oh oh
I'm thriving off the love that they gave to me oh oh
And all these groovy pills oh oh
That all these girls are taken oh oh
They thrivin' of those pills that they've taken oh I

[Outro: Ricky x Cudi]
I, ow, I, I, hey, I, I
All these groovy pills that they've taken, I, I
Ow, I, I, hey, I, I, I
Thriving off the love that they've gave to me
