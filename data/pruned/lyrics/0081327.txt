I like trains
I like trains
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Hey! Have you heard of the I Like Trains kid?
He's pretty cool, but there might be something wrong with him
I don't know if he's cursed, or if it's something with his brain
But the only thing he ever says is "I like trains."

[Chorus]
I like trains
I like trains
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
From birth, the I Like Trains kid never spoke a word
Not even to his parents, not a single sound was heard
But on the first day of school, the teacher asked his name
All he did was smile as he said "I like trains."

[Chorus]
I like trains
I like trains
Oh-oh-oh

They put him on some Ritalin to see if that would help
The doctor found the perfect dose and asked him how he felt
He stared at the doctor with a little creepy smile
And the I Like Trains kid said:
"I feel great!"
He got a fancy job and he straightened out his life
He met a nice girl who he asked to be his wife
As they stood at the altar, and prepared to say their vows
He put a ring on her finger, and he said:

[Chorus]
I like trains
I like trains
Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Got bad grades? I like trains!
Awkward date? I like trains!
Don't like trains?

[Chorus]
I like trains
I like trains
Oh-oh-oh
I like trains
I like trains
Oh-oh-oh
