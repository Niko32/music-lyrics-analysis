Oh, I get drunk most every night
Seems like all we do is fight
The more I drink, the less I feel blue
Sometimes I feel like an awful fool
Spendin' my life on an old barstool
And yes, I guess they oughta name a drink after you
Bloody mary

[Verse 2]
If this date were to be our last
I'd never sit down this glass
It'd take all the booze in the world to forget you
You've left my heart a vacant lot
I'll fill it with another shot
And yes, I guess they oughta name a drink after you
Near beer

[Verse 3]
Looks like I had my fill
Guess I better pay my bill
When I started out, I only meant to have a few
Someone just said that you left town
I better get a double round
And yes I guess they oughta name a drink after you
Yes, I guess they oughta name a drink after youYou might also like
