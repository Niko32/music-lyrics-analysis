Early morning, mankind sleeps
There's a roaring in the air
Inpenetrable fog

Thunder rolls and lightning strikes
Hell storms, rush over the earth
But there's no rain

[Chorus]
Hell storms
Rush over the earth
Bestial Invasion!

Fog cleared up, people scream
They won't believe that the evil takes control

[Chorus]
Hell storms
Rush over the earth...

Your time is out, obsession spreads
Death rules, satans law is in command

[Chorus]
Hell storms
Rush over the earth
Bestial Invasion!
You might also likeJesus Christ exists no longer
You better pray to the new lord
Cause he's almighty
Obey him...
