If I didn’t know better, I’d hang my hat right there
If I didn’t know better, I’d follow you up the stairs

[Verse 2: Clare Bowen and Sam Palladio]
Stop saying those sweet things
You know I’d like to hear
The horns are blowing louder
The bailiff's drawing near

[Chorus: Clare Bowen and Sam Palladio]
Why do I keep drinking
Wasting my time on you
If I didn’t know better
Well, dammit, I do

[Verse 3: Sam Palladio]
There’s a hole in what you’re saying
I can plainly see
You've a lover that’s waiting
But, baby, you’re right here with me

[Verse 4: Clare Bowen and Sam Palladio]
Ooh
You might as well be the devil
Keeping me out past three
Well, you’re the one with that apple
But, baby, you can’t blame me
You might also like[Chorus: Clare Bowen and Sam Palladio]
Why don’t you keep drinking
Give me one night with you
If I didn’t know better
Well, dammit, I do

[Outro: Clare Bowen and Sam Palladio]
Oh, baby, I do
Baby, you’re right here with me
Sweet daddy, you know I do
