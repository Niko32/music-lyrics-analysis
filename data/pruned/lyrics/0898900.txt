(You can't shut us down!)
Shut us up and shut us down!
(You can't shut us down!)

Why do you see us as a threat
We're only helping those that you forget
Or maybe you haven't forgotten the needy at all
But their votes just don't add up, so they don't amount to much at all!

Shut us up and shut us down!
(You can't shut us down!)
Shut us up and shut us down!
(You can't shut us down!)

Your political agenda has managed to fail us
All and if we organize ourselves the police will get involved
We'll fight you in your courts and we'll fight you in your halls
We'll fight you till you fuckin' fall
You can attack food not bombs
You can attack ABC but it won't be long
Before you'll have to answer to us all
'Cause you're the scum that'll be washed off the streets
When the rain begins to fall

(You're the scum that'll be washed off the streets)
When the rain begins to fall
