You want to go downhill as fast as you can
Going towards
A hill that's gonna take you in the air
And touch the sky
Feeling great
Adrenaline
In this world you must be crazy
There is a chance
That you will break
Every bone in your body
In this world you can't be lazy
There is too much action going on
At all times you must be strong
Come
Go with us
Through the snow
Going faster than the others
Come
Go with us
To the world
Of adrenaline
In this world the valleys and the mountains
Are covered with snow
That's why we'll have to go to
The top of the hill
And enjoy the silence
Before the snowslide
Before we begin our yourney
Come
Go with us
Through the snow
Going faster than the others
Come
Go with us
To the world
Of adrenaline
The sun goes under
You haven't noticed you've been out all day
But you feel happy
Because this is what you wanna do
The rest of your life
Have no fear
