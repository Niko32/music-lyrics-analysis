My babygirl fine, she's sweet like Mary Jane/
And like The Wanted, mamacita, yo, I'm glad you came
Sexual innuendo, I play it smooth like Nintendo/
When I hit the west coast, I hit the fly 64
Never fake the style, I keeps it wild like Toledo/
I be the Master Lyricist, also knows as Steelo
Black, my raps is phat like a 500-pound man/
And my rhymes florishing, enhancing the micstand
I'ma tough nigga, you can ask my cabrellos/
Meaning my brothers, so think that it'll be mellow
Cuz I'm a nice guy, nice guys can get mean/
My style is wicked, raps is harder than beat machines
Straight to the ends of the earths, I make it worse/
For rappers who wanna step to this, well, yes, of course
I rhyme for the havenots, y'all wanna diss the sound/
Profilic and profound, starting from the underground

(Hook)
That's how it is, boy, that's how it is!/
That's how it is, boy, that's how it is!
That's how it is, boy, that's how it is!/
The Awakening...

(Verse 2)
I'm kicking mad rappers to the curb like Mexico/
Gassing you fake niggas up like Texaco
From start to finish, I've been in it, you're just beginning/
To get on my level, you tremble when I'm ending
Your career, I'm waiting for the rest, this year/
Precise is ice cold, I'm as smooth as a Volvo
You can't test my flow, I'm like an elevator/
Rappers tryna get greasy like a jheri curl activator
My style is prosperous, no way you're stopping this/
Surprising how I breathe from my esophagous
Beddy bye time with this knockout rhyme/
Y'all wanna step to me, but that'll be your demise
Between your eyes is where I'll hit ya/
I can't miss ya, you a fake heavyhitter
Words I wrote and displayed on mics, I'm taking/
Rhymes to the highest peak, The Awakening
