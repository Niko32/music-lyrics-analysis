I warned you all the time
To get yourself in line, you never did it
I took you everywhere
No one else could bear all your bullshit
Your headtrips were a bore
I shoulda dumped you long before, you are a dimwit
When I took you out
Your ugly, dirty mouth was like a sewer
All you did was moan
So I left you on your own, I said "Screw ya"
I put it to ya
Now you're coming back
Tryin' to get into the act, ya fool ya
Ya think I'm stupid

[Chorus]
Scumbag, scumbag, you don't leave well enough alone
Baby, you're a scumbag, you're rotten to the core
You're the biggest fool that I've ever known

[Verse 2]
Every time it seemed
We had everything we dreamed for the choosin'
You never had enough
The way you made life rough sent me cruisin'
I gave a deposition 'bout your rotten disposition
You're a loser and you're losin', haha
You might also like[Chorus]
Scumbag, scumbag, you don't leave well enough alone
Baby, you're a scumbag, don't need you no more
You're the biggest fool that I've ever known

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Scumbag, scumbag, you don't leave well enough alone
Baby, you're a scumbag, a beggar, and a bore
You're the biggest fool that I've ever known

[Outro]
Yeah, uh-huh, you are, yeah, uh-huh, wow, ow, woo
