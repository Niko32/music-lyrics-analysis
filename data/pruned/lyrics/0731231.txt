It don't make sense how it works out
We just know that it does
And it don't always make sense now
But know it always adds up
Nickels and dimes
Oh no, nickels and dimes
Oh no, nickels and dimes

[Verse 1]
Crazy when I woke up this morning
I was still in debt (shit)
I'm still waiting on a check
Got home and its still bills from last week sitting in the mail
That I haven't paid yet
I didn't get the clothes that I want
But the prices ain't fair
Even when they are on sale
One day everything that I need
We'll be sitting in my hand
I just ain't there yet (oh)

[Bridge 1]
But everybody going through it
Everybody going through it
See everybody going through it
Everybody going through it
You might also like[Chorus 1]

[Bridge 2]
It don't make no sense now
But it'll always add up
Like nickels and dimes (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Looking back on my moms
I can't even comprehend
How she did what she did
Dropping out and taking two jobs
Taking care of two kids, yeah
Taco Bell to pay the rent
She did it without no money
More problems out here (yeah)
So when theres no money more problems out here

[Bridge 3]
Oh you know, you know that everybody
Everybody going through it
Everybody going through it (Hmmmmm)
Everybody going through it
Everybody going through it

[Chorus 2]
Yeah...Don't make sense how it works out
(Don't make sense how it works out)
We just know that it does
(hmmmm no)
And it don't always don't make sense now
(But I swear we never ... )
But know it always adds up
Nickels and dimes
Oh no, nickels and dimes
Oh no, nickels and dimes
[Bridge 2]

[Break]
Rental are
Cellphone payment too
Rental are, car insurance too
Rental now, health insurance too
Rental now, car payment too

[End]
If I had any more dollars
Dollars on my name
That'd make life much easier
Making  eighteen per hour
Damn that shit insane
If I had any more dollars
Dollars on my name, oh
Oh no, nickels and dimes
Oh no, nickels and dimes
You dont know how it works out
We just know that it does
Like nickels and dimes
