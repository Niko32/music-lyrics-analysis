Though we might have precious little
It's still precious

[Verse 1]
I like that song about this wonderful world
It's got a sunny point of view
And sometimes I feel it's true
At least for a few of us
I like that world, it makes a wonderful song
But there's a darker point of view
But sadly just as true
For so many among us

[Chorus 1]
Though we might have precious little
It's still precious

[Chorus 2]
In the sweetest child there's a vicious streak
In the strongest man there's a child so weak
In the whole wide world there's no magic place
So you might as well rise, put on your bravest face
Put on your bravest face

[Verse 2]
I like that show where they solve all the murders
An heroic point of view
It's got justice and vengeance too
At least so the story goes
I like that story, makes a satisfying case
But there's a messy point of view
That's sadly just as true
For so many among us
For so many among us

In softest voice there's an acid tongue
In the oldest eyes there's a soul so young
In the shakiest will there's a core of steel
On the smoothest ride there's a squeaky wheel

[Chorus 2]
In the sweetest child there's a vicious streak
In the strongest man there's a child so weak
In the whole wide world there's no magic place
So you might as well rise, put on your bravest face
Put on your bravest face

[Chorus 3]
In softest voice there's an acid tongue
In the oldest eyes there's a soul so young
In the shakiest will there's a core of steel
On the smoothest ride there's a squeaky wheel

[Chorus 2]
In the sweetest child there's a vicious streak
In the strongest man there's a child so weak
In the whole wide world there's no magic place
So you might as well rise, put on your bravest face
(Put on your bravest face)
[Chorus 1]
Though we might have precious little
It's still precious

[Chorus 3]
In softest voice there's an acid tongue
In the oldest eyes there's a soul so young
In the shakiest will there's a core of steel
On the smoothest ride there's a squeaky wheel

[Chorus 2]
In the sweetest child there's a vicious streak
In the strongest man there's a child so weak
In the whole wide world there's no magical place
So you might as well rise, put on your bravest face

[Outro]
You might as well rise, put on your bravest face
Put on your bravest face
Put on your bravest face
Put on your bravest face
