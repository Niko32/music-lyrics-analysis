When my baby moved out and the blues moved in
There wasn't nothing I could do
But mosey around with my head in my hands
Yelling, "What am I coming to?"
And I just keep moaning moaning the blues

[Bridge]
Well I wrote a nice long letter
Saying, "Mama please come home
Your Daddy is lonesome and all I do is moan"

[Verse 2]
I've been loving that gal for so doggone long
Can't afford to lose her now
I thought I was right, but I must have been wrong
Because my head is starting to bow
And I just keep moaning moaning the blues

[Bridge]
Well baby, baby, baby
Honey baby, please come home
Your Daddy is lonesome and all I do is moan

[Verse 3]
I've been loving that gal for so doggone long
Can't afford to lose her now
I thought I was right, but I must have been wrong
Because my head is starting to bow
And I just keep moaning moaning the bluesYou might also like
