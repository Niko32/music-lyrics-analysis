[Verse 1]
If you smile at me
You know I will understand
'Cause that is something everybody everywhere does
In the same language

[Verse 2]
Well I can see by your coat, my friend
That you're from the other side
There's just one thing I got to know
Can you tell me please who won?

[Verse 3]
You must try some of my purple berries
I've been eating them for six or seven weeks now
Haven't got sick once
Probably keep us both alive, yeah
[Part 2]
[Chorus 1]
Wooden ships on the water, very free and easy
Easy you know, the way it's supposed to be
Silver people on the shoreline leave us be
Very free and easy
You might also like[Verse 5]
Sail away where the morning sun goes high
Sail away where the wind blows sweet, young birds fly
Take a sister by her hand
Lead her far from this barren land

[Verse 6]
Horror grips us as we watch you die
All we can do is echo your anguished cry
Stare as all your human feelings die
We are leaving, you don't need us

[Verse 6]
Go and take a sister by her hand
Lead her far from this foreign land
Somewhere where we might laugh again
We are leaving, you don't need us

[Chorus 2]
Sailing ships on the water, very free and easy
Easy you know the way it's supposed to be
Silver people on the shoreline leave us be
Very free and gone

[Outro]
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh
Riding
Go ride the music
Come on
Go ride the music
Go ride the music
Go ride the music (I'm riding)
Go ride the music baby (I'm riding)
Go ride the music
Come on, ride it child
Go ride the music
