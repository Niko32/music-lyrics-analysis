Tell me it's fun
Don't make me lonely
Tell me I'm your only one

Let's get physical
All alone in the night
In the waves, in lights, I can't see myself
I look like you
I look like you
I look like you

My eyes in blue

Hey, you are the one
It must be fun
Tell me I'm lonely
Tell me I'm your only one

Turn in me and turn the lights
We find ourselves in night
Tell me it's fun
Tell me I'm just having fun

Let's get physical
All alone in the night
In the waves, in lights, I can't see myself
I look like you
I look like you
I look like you
You might also likeMy eyes in blue

Oh, I love you, baby
