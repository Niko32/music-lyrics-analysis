I hear the sound of the clock
And the drip of running water
I never thought it would be like this
It's 3 AM, and I can't sleep
I had it all planned out
Find a girl and get married
Do things that make your dreams
Oh, look at me
What more could you need?
I knew that I could win a room because I've always had it
But love is a scary thing
It's what they never taught
And I don't know now what's gotten me this far

[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanted was the world, all you wanted was me!

[Chorus]
It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
These one night stands are meaningless
But I'm laying in bed with a girl I just met at 3 AM

[Verse 2]
I wish I would of loved you instead of being selfish
And being so obsessed with my dreams
Oh, look at me I'm surrounded by the lonely
I thought I could win you back because I've always had it
But love is a tricky thing
It's what they never taught, that when you lose what you love
You lose a piece of your heart
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
All I wanted was the world, all you wanted was me!

[Chorus]
It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
These one night stands are meaningless
But I'm laying in bed with a girl I just met at 3 AM

[Bridge]
Everyday I still learn
From the mistakes that I have made
Who knew that things would be this way
I'm here because I wouldn't change
I've fallen on my face
But watch me get up again!

[Outro]
It's only in the end when you were gone
I didn't realize what I had lost
Now everything else is meaningless
So I'm laying in bed sick with regret at 3 AM
