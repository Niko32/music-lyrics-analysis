Love me till I don't know which way to go
That's what you do to me
Whoa, that's what you do to me

Love me wrong, love me right
Got me long before you offer the night
That's what you do to me
Whoa, that's what you do to me

Your love is like a river, an' somewhere in the middle
We're caught between your heart an' your hand
Each time I think it's real, it's such a helpless feelin'
With you I never know where I stand

Just a touch takes my desire
From your fryin' pan right into your fire
That's what you do to me
Whoa, that's what you do to me
