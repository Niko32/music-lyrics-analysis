I want you to know it, but the more I say it
The less it means in the end

Working for respect’s like climbing a mountain
And I think I’m losing my grip
Once I’m falling and I think I’m falling
There’s no getting back on it

But my face makes that sorry shape
I know who I am, but I lost my grace
I'm getting a stick and I march for more
Now I was wrong, everybody knows

My mouth is moving but nothing’s changing
I just can’t leave it alone
Nervous defense that’s doubled to senseless
Milked it dry like a bone

I milked it dry like a bone
I just can’t leave it alone
I milked it dry like a bone
I just can’t leave it alone

But my face makes that sorry shape
I know who I am, but I lost my grace
I'm getting a stick and I march for more
Now I was wrong, everybody knows
Everybody knows
You might also likeNo, I mean it, I’m really sorry; here I’ll say it again
I want you to know it that the more I say it
The less it means in the end
