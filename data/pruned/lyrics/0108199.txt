Found my self in a second, I
Found myself in a second-hand guitar
Never thought it would happen, but I
Found myself in a second-hand guitar

[Pre-Chorus]
I've just got to know
I truly have to know
So, you've got to let me know

[Chorus]
Is your love big enough for what's to come?

[Verse 2]
Got so hot in the city that I
Forgot everything I was looking for
Made my way to the dance floor, and I
Danced 'til I wasn't drunk anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
I've just got to know
I truly have to know
So, you've got to let me know

[Chorus]
Is your love big enough for what's to come?
(Baby, let me know)
Is your love big enough? The past is done
(Baby, let me know)

Underground, underground
With the friends I've found, friends I've found
Underground, underground
With the friends I've found, friends I've found
I scream, I scream
On 2nd Avenue
I scream on 2nd Avenue

[Outro]
Is your love big enough for what's to come?
(Baby, let me know)
Is your love big enough? The past is done
(Won't you let me know)
Is your love big enough for what's to come?
(Underground, underground
With the friends I've found, friends I've found)
Is your love big enough? The past is done (Big enough, big enough)
(Underground, underground
With the friends I've found, friends I've found)
Is your love big enough for what's to come?
(Won't you let me know)
Is your love big enough? The past is done
(Baby, let me know)
Is your love big enough? The past is done
(Underground with the friends I've found)
Is your love big enough for what's to come?
(Underground with the friends I've found)
