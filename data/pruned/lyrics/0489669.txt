Everybody's feeling the strain of the 9-to-5
Forecast is calling for rain, but we're still alive (yes, we are)
You know the sun is peeking over the clouds, and the music's tight
Drummer playing kick-drum proud as the bass takes flight

[Chorus]
Just celebrate tonight
There's reason to feel right
Everyone unite
And just celebrate tonight

[Verse 2]
Steady, child, don't get lost in your worried mind
Doesn't matter what it costs, matters what you find
Forget all of the pressure from all your deadlines

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Don't be afraid
Cause the sun's still warm in the shade
You gotta keep your chin up
And just celebrate this day

[Chorus]
You might also like[Outro]
Celebrate tonight
There's reason to feel right
Everyone unite
And just celebrate tonight [x2]
Everybody
Oh, we'll just celebrate tonight
