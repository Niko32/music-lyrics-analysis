Yeah, yeah, check it out
Antidepressants and anti vibe nose candy, tan yon high
Red huffy bike propping nanny on the handle bars
I push the Dukes of Hazzard big wheel, pulled the brake
Chase the ice cream truck down the street
Full mistake
Caught a cramp, Fat Boys style since a youngin
Ketchup stains on my shirt, look what I’m becoming
Reagan got shot, Bush became president later
Clinton got his dick sucked, Ken style was a hater
About your pose voice drop
Yeah, got an oct to blow
Lugers
My socks when I rocked them yo
[plaguer ribbed sugar raiser ? hotdog]
The fix is in
The best cars are made right in Michigan
Listening to Beastie Boys on cassette deck from a boombox
Pedophile rumors from the king with the moonwalk
Moms calling out my name I ain’t in for dinner yet
TVs with antennas that was way before the internet

[Hook x2]
Look at the news on the TV as the world turns
I saw the world change and the World Trade burn
I don’t believe in hardly anything but evolution
They should have killed us all, the children of the revolution

Guidos rocking Pete Rose hairdos and speedos
While Scarface schooled us all on how to move was a kilo
We went from rocking Michael Jackson and Hall and Oates
To rocking 8 ball jackets and 8 balls of coke
Seen the 80s when the dukie truck chains was called ropes
And Dapper Dan splashed Gucci logos on all of his clothes
Reaganomics was popping
So was Riker’s Island and Spofford
In '87, '88 half of my projects was locked up
Same time as Iran contra and Ollie North
Dreams of Def Jam, Profile, Tommy Boy
Ralph McDaniels in the afternoon passed the shrooms
Light the weed, catch me in the apartment 2C
Playing Break Street on my Commodore 64
Listening to breakbeats, Mr. Magic and Marley Marl
Either that or a new 68
The world turns while the revolution's viewed with a shifty face

[Hook x2]

[Verse 3: Slaine]
People man DJing in a park with the lethal hands
Puerto rican man
Jamaican playing with perico grands
Gorbachev birthmark on his head, the wars off
Slayer and Metallica besides that his sword is soft
Met a wise Public Enemy
Voice of the ghetto vizor
Evolution of a revolution is televised
Bin laden in the CIA now they telling lies
Escobar, King in South America and selling pies
[Verse 4: ILL Bill]
The devil rise as another empire falls
The enterprise allies on weaponized fire balls
At first claiming a higher cause
As soon central lies intelligence reveal their bottom plans on then I ain't yours
We went from innocence to cynicism
From heavy metal lyricists to hip-hop lyricism
From animation to live action, suspended animation
To sleepers cells To Manchurian assassins

[Hook x2]
