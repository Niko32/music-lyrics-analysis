Where you at Water?

[Verse 1: E-40]
I'm trapped in my own mind, I'm trapped like I'm in bondage
Everybody ain't eating, some of us hungry like a hostage
Mess around, come up leaking, with the 30-round car tread
To the brain, he bled, we'll do anything to get fed
California reality, with a California mentality
Pushing weight like calories to collect our salaries
Pimping pink toes, like Becky, Marge, and Valerie
(Who you allergic to?) I'm allergic to suckers, mayne, like allergy

[Chorus: Sevin]
This is for the Westside, Westside
This is for the Westside, Westside
This is for the Westside, Westside
This is for the Westside, Westside
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California

[Verse 2: 40 Glocc]
Look at these California Chucks with these California strings
With California Dickies with these California T's
Say the wrong thing, get hit with them California things
I come from the land of them California G's
Catch me bending corners, sipping California lean
And if you really really, join my California team
We some real B's and some California C's
Oh, you didn't know? It's a California thing
You might also like[Chorus: Sevin]
This is for the Westside, Westside
This is for the Westside, Westside
This is for the Westside, Westside
This is for the Westside, Westside
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California

[Verse 3: Snoop Dogg]
Where the Crips C Crippin' and the low-lows be dippin'
And the laws keep trippin', but you know we do it our way
Californ-I-A, West like Kanye
From G's to boys to men, no singing like Wanya
Gangster shit with a cute bitch
She roll a blunt, then count money and talk shit, you'z a trick
You wanna know my bitch dress size?
Break bread or fake dead, this is for the best side, the Westside

[Chorus: Sevin]
This is for the Westside, Westside
This is for the Westside, Westside
This is for the Westside, Westside
This is for the Westside, Westside
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
[Verse 4: Too $hort]
Welcome to the Bay, mayne (Bitch)
You a long way from L.A., mayne (Bitch)
But it's just as dangerous
No Crips and Bloods, but the shit don't change that much
Niggas still representing, throw it up
You can't have a good time if you don't know enough
'Cause Cali girls like to show that stuff
And us Oakland niggas, we have 'em ho'ing up (Bitch)

[Chorus: Sevin]
This is for the Westside, Westside
This is for the Westside, Westside
This is for the Westside, Westside
This is for the Westside, Westside
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California

[Verse 5: Xzibit]
California plates on my California Phantom
Roll that California kush up and early Cali smashin'
California earthquakes, California sunshine
Caught up in that twist, call it California wartime
California politickin', California consequences
Bitches be flocking to California, flipping like pigeons
California banned fully automatic weapons
California kid to a California legend
When Cali get together watch how California ball
Show some California love, put some plaques up on the wall
California scream for the Golden State Warrior
Born in Detroit but made in California
[Chorus: Sevin]
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
Yeah, welcome to California
