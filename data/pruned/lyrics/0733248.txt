Isn't it just like the sea
To come between you and me
On the water you'd be
As I watched with anxiety

[Chorus]
You'd say don't hate the sea from the shore
The ocean was here long before the land
Take my hand
Come out here with me
Of course I'd never leave
And you'd float out to sea

[Instrumental Break]

[Repeat Verse]

[Outro]
You'd say don't hate the sea from the shore
The ocean was here long before the land
