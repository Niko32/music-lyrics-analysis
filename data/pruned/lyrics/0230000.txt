Even though you always were alone
You had to push against the fates
Just to make it, make it through the gate
But now we're getting older and we're growing up
So now less action in the water and we know enough
Stood up on the rooftop on a night so clear
That the lights from the city just disappeared
I know you don't believe me
When I believe in you
I know it could get much easier
If you want it to
Old friend, come to me
Everything I was, I used to be
I went north and I went east
Following the footsteps of some beautiful beast

But now we're getting older and we're growing up
So now less action in the water and we know enough
Stood up on the rooftop on a night so clear
That the lights from the city just disappeared

I know you don't believe me
When I believe in you
I know it could get much easier
If you want it to
You might also likeI know you don't believe me
When I believe in you
I know it could get much easier
If you want it to

Oh, how we used to run up in the park
Cool air and eucalyptus leaves
Oh, how we'd look out out over the bay
Must've followed through the gate
Couldn't wait to get away

I know you don't believe me
When I believe in you
I know it could get much easier
If you want it to

I know you don't believe me
When I believe in you
But I know it's getting easier
Like it's supposed to do
