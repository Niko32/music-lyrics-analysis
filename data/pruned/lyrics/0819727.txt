Whatcha know about borrowing
From the neighbor next door
Whatcha know about bumming rides
Whatcha know about having to swallow your pride

What do you do when you're through
When you're always helping people and
Nobody's there for you, come on now

And me and my baby got to eat

'Till I get my check next week

And me and my baby got to eat

When you're always helping people and
Nobody's there for you (Tell me)

Besides being too busy, busy
Stressin' me constantly

See I only got 20 dollars
And you still want half of that
