It belong us
To tack like fire needles
Keeping human secret
Because some of the monkey's lies

Don't still full mouth
Don't still full mouth
Don't still in places with memory

Like arrows with a walking energy
We'll make the footpath
You are a bad soldier
'cause the closer you get to cesar
The biggest becomes the fear
You lost the paradise
I think we're getting in
We're getting in (getting in)
I'm a monkey

It belongs us to tack like fire needles
Keeping human monkeys
Keeping human monkeys

Unknown future is not easy to get
With this hunger and this subtle smell
Trailing this nature that competes with itself
All the monkeys are the same one
Monkey see, monkey do
I'm a monkey
Monkey see, monkey do
I'm a monkey
I'm a monkey

Don't still full mouth
Don't still in places with memory

It belongs us to tack like fire needles
Keeping human monkeys
