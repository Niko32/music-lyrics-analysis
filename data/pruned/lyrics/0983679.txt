Far above our range can't hear them crying
When the dawn approaches they're headed to their home
Sleep through the day to then awake at sunset

They may not see
But they can hear in color
Paint a sonic picture in their heads
So they can survive

Eyes never seemed to be an option
Left completely blind to hunt in darkness
Their world, it has no light and they don't need it
An image made of sound to hear around

They may not see
But they can hear in color
Paint a sonic picture in their heads
So they can survive

Experience with hearing eyes
Light is not the only way to see

Use a different wave
See another way
You might also likeThey may not see
But they can hear in color
Paint a sonic picture in their heads
So they can survive

Experience with hearing eyes
Light is not the only way to see

They may not see
But they can hear in color
Paint a sonic picture in their heads
So they can survive

Experience with hearing eyes
Light is not the only way to see
