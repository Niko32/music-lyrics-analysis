Leave your restless heart behind
Let the fear of the unknown subside
Let the tears flow from your eyes
The beginning of the journey home
Won't be easy but it's free
So stay on course; don't look behind
It's the dawn of a new day
The dawn of a new day

A wounded dove with a broken wing
Will fly again come May
A child will be born today
An old man will pass away
Please don't wait; don't stay away too long
There's trouble on the horizon
Cause right is wrong and wrong is right
I hope I'm there when you arrive
I hope I'm there when you arrive

But the nature of a man like me
Is to turn away and give in to my desire
I stumble to my feet again
Knowing you're still there
You never left my side
I'm nowhere without your love
I'm so lost without you here
I'm nowhere without your love
You might also likeFind your way through the narrow gate
Accept this invitation with body soul and mind

You can bow your head well; leave right now
Leave your restless heart behind
Just stay on course; don't look away
It's the dawn of a new day
The dawn of a new day
A new day

But the nature of a man like me
Is to turn away and give in to my desire
I stumble to my feet again
Knowing you're still there
You never left my side
I'm nowhere without your love
I'm so lost without you here
I'm nowhere without your love

I'm nowhere without your love
I'm nowhere without your love
I'm gonna be where you are
I'm nowhere without your love
