Ah yeah, we sending this one out from everybody
I mean to everybody from the H-Town to the A-Town to worldwide
So get your lighters, get your drink
And I tell you what
I'm so fucked up, and screwed up
If anybody try to blow my high, you know what I'mma tell 'em

[Chorus]
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(I'm screwed up)

[Verse 1: Ludacris]
I feel better than I've ever felt before, Ah!
Intoxicated but maintaining self-control, Ah!
I took a swig, I had a jug, chug-a-log, I'm loud and clear
I had some bud, I lit it up, and then I made it disappear
'Cause my magic tricks are so fabulous
This shit's hazardous, got amateurs smoking cannabis
If you mad at this, damn it then

[Chorus]
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(I'm screwed up)

I made a, call to my dog, time to split the blunt and break it up
Three-wheel motion, purple potion, I gotta shake it up
I tried to kick the habit, but it keep calling me
Abracadabra, here's a magic trick, I smoked up all the weed
Zig-Zag's and golden wraps got my mind gone
Drugs don't affect my work, I still get my grind on

[Chorus]
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(I'm screwed up)

[Verse 3: Ludacris]
I'm leaning like the Tower of Pisa, the syrup squeezer
Come close to my stash, and get treated as if I'm Ebenezer
I'm throwed, blowed, matter-of-fact let's call this the thrower potion
I'm screwed up, so no wonder things are in slower motion
I gots to have it, can't kick the habit, I've tried to shake it
The drug experiment stage if you mistake then

[Chorus]
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(I'm screwed up)
[Verse 4: Lil' Flip]
I'm from Screwed Up Texas, we drive reckless, and then we peel off
You ain't had shit until you smoke Sweet Tooth and Jack Frost
Hit it twice but don't cough, you gotta take it man
If it's a record for smoking I'm 'bout to break it man
Me and Luda puffing budda, we in a black Cougar
On Zap Judas, you try to jack us, we grab rugers

[Chorus]
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(I'm screwed up)

[Verse 5: Ludacris]
How can I say it plain?
That I'm off that Mary Jane
And if it's true what they say
Then I don't know how many cells is left in my fucking brain
But I'mma keep on writing and lighting
Minds of these hungry rappers
And tell the hood that I've hired niggas and fired crackers
On the Fourth of July
Open your eyes, I'm joking, stupid
I love all races but if you hating my music then
[Chorus]
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(I'm screwed up)

[Verse 6: Lil' Flip]
I love my occupation, we never have to take a piss test
Fuck a 9 to 5 'cause I'm always getting rest
I wake to breakfest and head
You wake up to breakfast in bed
Should I drive my H2?
Hmm, I'mma take the Lexus instead
Pimping ain't dead
But I'll leave you niggas dead from all this pimping
I'm riding spinners like a pimp
That's why I'm limping

[Chorus]
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(I'm screwed up)

[Verse 7: Ludacris]
Off substances that's controlled
That's how this story goes
I popped the cap, broke the ice
And Lil' Flip done broke the mold
I'm so cold I think I see dead people
Nah, that's just my homies passed out in the Regal
Believe it, the potency is so strong, if you notice me
I'm calm, cool, and collected, and if you disrespect it, then

[Chorus]
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(I'm screwed up)

[Verse 8: Lil' Flip]
We doing this for them players that bang screw music
We don't pass out after eight blunts, because we used to it
Me and Cris like Cheech & Chong
So hurry, break out the weed and the bong
'Cause if it ain't Grade-A trees, we gotta leave it alone
And to my homie Screw, you know I gotta hold it down
And if they want it then they gotta come and take the crown

[Chorus]
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(I'm screwed up)

[Outro]
Hahahahahaha So there you have it
Sending this one out to all my drinkers and all my smokers
United and lighted we stand inebriated we fall
And if you wanna pass the sobriety and breathalyzer test
Here's a quick Luda tip some packets of mustard in your car
Keep mustard goddamn it and whoever said the south can't rhyme

[Chorus]
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(Fuck you) Fuck you!
(I'm screwed up)
