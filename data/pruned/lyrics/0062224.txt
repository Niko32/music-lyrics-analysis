Minded out my past
Damn its so familiar
That they hardly ever last
Now they tried tellin' me
Messed up on my mind
Called and saved my pain
Got the ones you'll never find

Its all right
We can play chess all night
Its all right
We can play chess all night

Tell me that Im all right
Tell me
Tell me that Im all right
Tell me
Tell me that Im all right
