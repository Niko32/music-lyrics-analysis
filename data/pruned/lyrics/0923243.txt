Put him out of your heart, out of mind, out of sight
He ain't worth worrying your pretty blue eyes
Let the heartache ride tonight
Yeah, let the heartache ride tonight

I've been watching him treat you bad
I've seen enough and it's making me mad
I dont know who he thinks he is
But his first mistake was leaving you like this all alone
'Cause I got some moves of my own
And I won't do you wrong

No sense sitting here by yourself
When he's out running with somebody else
You played the fool long enough
Now the time has come to even up the score
Now, baby there's so much more
What are we waiting for?

Let the heartache ride tonight
Put him out of your heart, out of mind, out of sight
He ain't worth worrying your pretty blue eyes
Let the heartache ride tonight
Yeah, let the heartache ride tonight

When I play for love, I play for keeps
He's in for a big surprise
I can't wait to see that look in his eyes
When he finds out, the heartbreak, what it's all about
He's the one who lost out

Let the heartache ride tonight
Put him out of your heart, out of mind, out of sight
He ain't worth worrying your pretty blue eyes
Let the heartache ride tonight
Yeah, let the heartache ride tonight

Let the heartache ride tonight
Put him out of your heart, out of mind, out of sight
He ain't worth worrying your pretty blue eyes
Let the heartache ride tonight
Yeah, let the heartache ride tonight
Yeah, let the heartache ride tonight

Let the heartache ride
Let the heartache ride
Let the heartache ride
Let the heartache ride
Let the heartache ride
