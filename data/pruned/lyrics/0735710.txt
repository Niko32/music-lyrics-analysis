Since back then there wasn’t no way I could win
Since back then I couldn’t even trust my friends
Since back when? Since back then
Since back when? Since back then
Since back then mama say stay close to your kin
Stay low, say amen
Since back then, since back then
Since back then, since back then
Say since back then, say since back when
Stay as a family, naturally, pray to the lord, we in it to the end

[Verse 1]
Since back then I was hot like cayenne
Moved from Palm Beach straight to the Nawf, how 'bout 10
Since back then, I kicked a lot of doors
Since back then I flipped a lot of fours
Say since back when, I had a lot of enemies
You ain’t no kin to me
Tryna be a friend who got hating bitch tendencies
Loyalty, all of my niggas around me you know they gon' bust
Don’t ever switch sides, be down to ride
That’s the real meaning of trust

[Chorus]
Since back then there wasn’t no way I could win
Since back then I couldn’t even trust my friends
Since back when? Since back then
Since back when? Since back then
Since back then mama say stay close to your kin
Stay low, say amen
Since back then, since back then
Since back then, since back then
Say since back then, say since back when
Stay as a family, naturally, pray to the lord, we in it to the end

This shit just began, but we in it to the end
No more going broke, today I woke up, thank you, amen
Since back then, trap had flavors like Now and Laters
But that shit’s still, keep it 100, I’m being for real
You trill, since when, when since, back then
Day one no gun, way before a nigga had the MAC 10
OG, from the streets, Nawf, made me
Don’t forget where you’re from, 45th street, what’s up home Bs

[Chorus]
Since back then there wasn’t no way I could win
Since back then I couldn’t even trust my friends
Since back when? Since back then
Since back when? Since back then
Since back then mama say stay close to your kin
Stay low, say amen
Since back then, since back then
Since back then, since back then
Say since back then, say since back when
Stay as a family, naturally, pray to the lord, we in it to the end
