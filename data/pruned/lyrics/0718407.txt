And if you do the same, we can both go through
Without people on the run, living only for themselves
You can do it if you want, but it’s bad for your health
And if someone picks your pocket in the dark
And turns you on your brother, just make yourself a mark

Hey, open up your eyes baby

Baby I know it’s hard, sometimes you feel alone
Spend all day in your car, just trying to keep your home
And there’s people on the move, that make money off the dead
They will carve you up, sell you off, put a price on your head
And if someone picks your pocket in the dark
You can stumble through the blackness or you can try to light a spark
