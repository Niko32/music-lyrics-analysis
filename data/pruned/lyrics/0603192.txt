In a world where love is found and lost so easily
I'm so thankful I share my life with you
All around you hear the sound of faithless poetry
Oh I won't lie, that's something I won't do

[Chorus]
There must be a million words to whisper soft and low
There must be a million ways, I could let my feelings show
But loving you with all my heart and never letting go
That's the only way, the only way I know

[Verse 2]
Maybe I will never say everything I feel
Even so, you'll always know the truth
And in the silence of a touch, every word is real
As long as I live that's what I give to you

[Chorus]
There must be a million words to whisper soft and low
There must be a million ways, I could let my feelings show
But loving you with all my heart and never letting go
That's the only way, the only way I know
Oh, that's the only way, the only way I know

[Outro]
That's the only way, that's the only way
The only way I know
That's the only way, that's the only way
The only way I knowYou might also like
