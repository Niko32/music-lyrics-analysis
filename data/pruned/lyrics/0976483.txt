You should see me walking with my girlfriend
You would swear we both were one
And it's something else, too
We walk so close, can't tell where one ends
And the other begins
So much love, just ain't no way to tell

[Chorus]
You could see we make it together
You could see the love look in our eyes
You could see we make it together, forever

[Verse 2]
You should love someone the way that I do
Don't you know that your whole life's a stage?
Try to find somebody who's gonna love you
Love you like mine, if only for your own sake

[Chorus]
You could see we make it together
You could see the love look in our eyes
You could see we make it together, forever

[Bridge]
You could see a long-time love in action
We're living and we're loving our lives away, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
You could see we make it together
You could see the love look in our eyes
You could see we make it together, forever
