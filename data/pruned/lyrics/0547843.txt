I think, my fears come true
You feel, the same way too
I'm leaving
Pack my bags
And I'll
See you later
See you later

[Verse 2]
Looks like I can't keep up
And you're fresh out of luck
You want fire where its wrong, out of sight
When race already won
See you later
See you later

[Refrain]
Now that I'm older, can't seem to fight this feeling
Running in circles, feels like I can't compete with
Now that I'm older, can't seem to fight this feeling
Running in circles, feels like I can't compete with

[Bridge]
It's not
Too late now
Too late now

Now that I'm older, can't seem to fight this feeling
Running in circles, feels like I can't compete with
Now that I'm older, can't seem to fight this feeling
Running in circles, feels like I can't compete with
Now that I'm older, can't seem to fight this feeling
Running in circles, feels like I can't compete with
Now that I'm older, can't seem to fight this feeling
Running in circles, feels like I can't compete with
Feels like I can't compete with
Feels like I can't compete with
