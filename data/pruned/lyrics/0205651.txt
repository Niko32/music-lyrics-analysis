She wakes you up early in the morning
She tells you, "Baby, I feel a little horny"
She brings you up and then you know you want it
I like the way you give it girl
Your mouth is dry
Your heart is beating faster
You want to die but you're afraid to ask her
She pops a gun
Your prayer's already answered
Tick tock, man
Thank you ,man

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't fool yourself
You can't stop it if you try
And it's a bumpy ride

[Chorus]
She be the one
She be the drug
She's going to take you high, take your love
And never get enough
She be the one
She be the bomb
Watch out here she comes
You know you're going to get some
You might also like[Verse 2]
She hits a club
And everybody watches
And when she dances
Everybody wants it
The kind of girl you've kind of got to watch
She might just get away

[Verse 3]
She makes you wait
She likes to play that kind of game
She takes your money
And tries to give it all away
She makes you nasty
And makes you want to feel pain
Then she'll make you want it again

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't fool yourself
You can't stop it if you try
And it's a bumpy ride

[Chorus]
She be the one
She be the drug
She's going to take you high, take your love
And never get enough
She be the one
She be the bomb
Watch out here she comes
You know you're going to get some
[Verse 4]
You know you're going to get some
You know you're going to get some
You know you're going to get some
You're really going to get some
You know you're going to get some
You're really going to get some
You know you're going to get some
She be the one
She be the one

[Chorus]
She be the one
She be the drug
She's going to take you high, take your love
And never get enough
She be the one
She be the bomb
Watch out here she comes
You know you're going to get some
She be the one
She be the drug
She's going to take you high, take your love
And never get enough
She be the one
She be the bomb
Watch out here she comes
You know you're going to get some
