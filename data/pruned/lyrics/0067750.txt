Hug me take me back in your arms erase the hurt from the past
I'm shedding tears as I speak these words my heart broke as I wrote this verse
Girl how could you leave me I swear down that's soo absurd
How can you just turn your back on me and pretend that nothings happening
Your breaking my heart tearing me apart and I ain't one for showing emotions
You've got me tossing and turning at night cause I know that I can't hold you tight
You never even gave me a reason just up and left me like

Unbreak my heart say you love me again
Undo this hurt that you caused
When you walked out the door
And moved out of my life
Uncry these tears I've cried soo many nights
Unbreak my heart

You was the only reason I was smiling but now you've walked out of my life
Bet the past 5 months meant nothing to you it hurt babee I ain't gonna lie
I've got tears rolling down my cheek when you left I swear I couldn't speak
You seem soo damn heartless left me feeling soo hurt and weak
It was like I meant nothing to you what happened to "I love you boo"
What happened to me and you forever I thought you was someone I could turn to
I'm sorry I couldn't hold you sometimes but I wish I could make it right
I wish I can turn back the time unbreak my heart and make things right

Unbreak my heart say you love me again
Undo this hurt that you caused
When you walked out the door
And moved out of my life
Uncry these tears I've cried soo many nights
Unbreak my heart
You might also likeCan't reunite that flame that we blew out and bring back that love that we threw out
I swear I will wipe every tear drop keep you safe I promise you fear not
You can't delete the times that we had laying under stars holding hands
You know that I would never wanna hurt you so come back and let me be your man
Please come and undo this heart break cause I'm sitting here with soo much heart ache
Got tears rolling down my face you don't know how much I love you babe
Truth is I know your hurting too I've heard about your sleepless nights
And the way that you've been crying boo so you know what babe it's all up to you

Unbreak my heart say you love me again
Undo this hurt that you caused
When you walked out the door
And moved out of my life
Uncry these tears I've cried soo many nights
Unbreak my heart

Unbreak my heart say you love me again
Undo this hurt that you caused
When you walked out the door
And moved out of my life
Uncry these tears I've cried soo many nights
Unbreak my heart
