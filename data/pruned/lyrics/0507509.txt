So you think it's over now
There's one thing you forgot about
The voice inside your head gets loud
Chews you up and spits you out

[Chorus]
Enemy unseen
Out of the underground
Enemy unseen
Disorder all around

[Verse 2]
So you think it's over now
There's one thing you forgot about
This headrush you can't live without
Got to get rid of somehow

[Chorus]You might also like
