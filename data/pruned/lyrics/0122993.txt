In a rush to get ready for work
I've spilled hot coffee on my shirt
It hurt
I ran to catch the bus to be on time, yeah
But the driver sped away
And left me running behind

[Chorus]
Well then my knees dropped to the ground
And I was really feeling down
Then baby you called me
You called me to tell me you love me
And everything was alright

I wanted to buy you a real nice dress
So I saved up some money from my paychecks
I went down to your favorite department store, yeah
Oh but everything they had was more than I could afford
Oh my Lord

[Chorus]
Well then my knees dropped to the ground
And I was really feeling down
Then baby you called me
You called me just to tell me you love me
And everything was all right
Outta sight
Oh baby baby
Oh you turn me around
You might also likeOooh yeah, ohh baby, baby, baby, baby
You turn me around
Whenever you pick up that line
Well Iâ€™m so thankful for that dime
Every time you call me, you call me
Just to tell me you love me
Woo baby, you call me, you call me
Just to tell me you love me
Yeah, yeah, you call me, you call me
Just to tell me you love me
