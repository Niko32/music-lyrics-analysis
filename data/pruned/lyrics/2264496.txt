[Verse 1: Sam Smith]
I'm feeling something, something different
When you left, my picture changed
I was blinded, I'd not envisioned
The same face in a different frame

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
It's an omen, caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me, without you I am lonely

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

[Post-Chorus: Sam Smith]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, omen

[Verse 2: Sam Smith]
You were waiting, I was vacant
You left before  my eyes
Then it hit me, you're relocating
And I need you by my side
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Sam Smith]
It's an omen, caught my baby crying
Saw the silver lining
It must be an omen
Needed you to show me, without you I am lonely

[Chorus: Sam Smith]
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen
My mind would rule my heart
I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark
It left me torn apart
But now I see your tears as an omen

[Outro: Sam Smith]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, omen (Woah, now, love)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, omen
(I didn't pay attention to the light in the dark)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, omen (But now I see your tears as an omen)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, omen (Now I see your tears as an omen)
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, omen
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, omen
