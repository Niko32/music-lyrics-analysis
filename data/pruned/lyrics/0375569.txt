I used to dress in black every night
I used to dress in black every night
But something happened to me
Something happened to me
And now, I dress in white

You used to get it wrong every night
You used to get it wrong every night
And there was nothing left to do
But pump high voltage into you
And now, you mostly get it right

[Pre-Chorus]
And you were blinded for the moment
By my country and western star ship last night
You were tumbling and bumbling
Like a bird that's just had its wings clipped during flight

[Chorus]
And the congregation of the prayers begins to sing, aah
They were sick delinquents joining the queue
Of the soft steaming shits demanding...
Gay Bar Part Two

[Verse 2]
I used to dress in black every night
Now I dress primarily in white
And I was under duress
Removed my pants and my vest
And now I'm undressed tonight
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And you were silenced for the moment
By my Peter, Paul and Mary box set last night
You were crumbling and mumbling like a pugilist being pummeled mid-fight

And the leagues of evil temper began to sing, aah
And I've never seen anything cause you such fright
There's something very wrong with you...
So let's stay in tonight
She was my dark angel every night
She was my dark angel every night
But something happened to her
Something happened to her
And now... she's white
