See, my days are cold without you (Here's another one)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you
See, my days are cold without you (Here's another one)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more (Uh)
I won't keep running back to you (Uh, uh, here's another one, what? What?)

[Verse 1: Ashanti, The Notorious B.I.G.]
I think I found my strength to finally get up and leave
No more broken heart for me, no more telling your lies to me (Here's another one)
I'm looking like I got my head on right, so now I see
No more giving you everything, there's no more taking my love from me (What? What?)

[Chorus: Ashanti]
See, my days are cold without you (Here's another one)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you
See, my days are cold without you (Here's another one)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more (Uh)
I won't keep running back to you (Uh)

I'm glad to wake up every day without you on my brain (Uh)
No more where you're laid up at night
No more having to fuss and fight
I'm proud to say that I will never make the same mistake (Here's another one, and another one)
No more thinkin' bout what you do (Uh)
There's no more of me running back to you (What? What?)

[Chorus: Ashanti, The Notorious B.I.G.]
See, my days are cold without you (Uh)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (Uh)
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you
See, my days are cold without you (Uh, here's another one)
But I'm hurting while I'm with you (And another one)
And though my heart can't take no more (Uh, uh)
I won't keep running back to you (What?)
[Verse 3: The Notorious B.I.G., Ashanti]
Some say the X make the sex (Uh)
Spectacular, make me lick you from your neck
To your back, then you're shivering, tongue delivering (Uh)
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine (Woo)
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If it's alright with you, we fucking (That's cool)
Déjà vu, the blunts sparked, finger fucking in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between your legs? (Uh)
You begged for me to stop
Because you know where it would head (Uh)
Straight to your mother's bed
At the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to your sister, damn, I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle (Haha)
Now I know you used to suites at the Parker Meridian
Trips to the Caribbean, but tonight, no ends
[Bridge: Ashanti, The Notorious B.I.G.]
You must be used to me crying, crying (Uh, uh, and another one)
While you're out bumping and grinding
But I'm leaving you tonight

[Chorus: Ashanti]
See, my days are cold without you
But I'm hurting while I'm with you
And though my heart can't take no more
I can't keep running back to you

[Outro: Ashanti, The Notorious B.I.G.]
You must be used to me crying, crying (Uh, and another one)
While you're out bumping and grinding
But I'm leaving you tonight (Uh, and another one)
