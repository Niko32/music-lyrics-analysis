There's a house down on the corner
With the porch light on
And a window I can look in
And see you're always home
Waiting for me with the lights low
In your silk nightgown
Somewhere on the outskirts
Of memory town

[Verse 2]
And past the stop-light
There's a desert where my Coupe Deville
Roars down a lonely highway
And it always will
The wind is in your hair
And we're nowhere to be found
Two spirits on the boulevard
In memory town

[Chorus]
I can pull the shades and feel your lips
They're touching mine again
I can watch the shadows of the moon
Slow dance across your skin
Hold you in a place where lovers
Never say goodbye
Every moment comes alive
When I go down to memory town
You might also like[Verse 3]
And 'round the corner
There's an ocean where the waves roll in
And a feeling that you only feel
When love begins
We lie together in the sand
And watch the sun go down
I close my eyes and smell the warm salt air
In memory town

[Chorus]
I can pull the shades and feel your lips
They're touching mine again
I can watch the shadows of the moon
Slow dance across your skin
Hold you in a place where lovers
Never say goodbye
Every moment comes alive
Every time I close my eyes
And go back down to memory town

[Bridge]
There's a house down on the corner
With the porch light on
A window I can look
And see you're always home
Waiting for me with the light low
In your silk nightgown
Somewhere on the outskirts
Of memory town
[Outro]
Take me down
Take me down
To memory town
Take me down
To memory town
