Or was that a scream?
I don't quite think you're what you seem
Is there an honest face
In a hidden place waiting to be seen
It's just another day
In your tragic play
And then I hear you say
"It's changed"...but there's something strange
'Cause you're not the same...

When you smile
I can see the pain and the sadness makes me cry
Your eyes
Are an open door to the fiction in your life

Is that a happy face
Or a hiding place?
'Cause your smile's not so real
Is there a touch of science to your silence
When it comes to what you feel?

It's just another stain
On your robe of shame
And now it's just so plain to see
That you're just like me...emotionally
You might also likeWhen you smile...
I can see the pain and compassion make me cry
Your eyes...
Are an open door to the fiction in your life

If it's the truth that hurts
Then see how you're killing me
So easily...when you smile

When you smile
I can see the pain and the sadness makes me cry
Your eyes
Are an open door to the fiction in your life
