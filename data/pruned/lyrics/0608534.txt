There are some things I'll
Never know
It will be here forever
But it never felt
So cold
I remember when I never used to feel
Afraid
Like the way we used to throw ourselves
Into the waves

Voices, voices
Carrying, carrying, carrying
Voices, voices
Cover me, cover me, cover me
Voices, voices
Carrying, carrying, carrying
Voices I'll always listen to
Every word they speak

Like the cold from the bottom
There are things im afraid to know
Push to the surface
To the light, with the eyes
Still closed
Held by the touch
New blood, washed clean
By the cold
Heart beat
In the leaves, in the voice
In the smoke
You might also likeVoices, voices
Carrying, carrying, carrying
Voices, voices
Cover me, cover me, cover me
Voices, voices
Carrying, carrying, carrying
Voices I'll always listen to
Every word they speak

Voices that know us
Heaven below us
Voices that show us
Will always speak for us
