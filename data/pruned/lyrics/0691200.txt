In 1927 Oklahoma blew away
And we started 'cross the country in a beat up Chevrolet
Our backs were to the sunrise and our feet were on the path
We're going out to the promised land and the Grapes of Wrath
They called us dirty rednecks and they called us filthy bums
Said we don't want you all in our town
So why the Hell'd you come?
We ain't scared of anybody we're just running from the drought
And I'm damn proud I'm an Ok so you'd better watch your mouth

[Chorus]
California you're a faker
California you're a lie
Because the rich keep getting richer
While the hungry children cry
One of these days
You're going to pay
For your mistakes

[Verse 2]
I spent all my younger days just following the sun
I met the only girl I ever loved when I was 21
And Ruby was the only good thing that I ever had
Oh Lord, I don't know how thing can turn out so bad
We moved out close to Bakersfield and tried to settle down
I got a job share cropping for the richest man in town
If he'd a just left us alone we'd a lived a happy life
But he couldn't keep his eyes off of my wife
He slipped into my house one day when Ruby was alone
And by the time that I got back the damage had been done
And what I saw when I walked in just filled me full of hate
And she just laid there crying
Like her heart would break
I grabbed my gun and started out but Ruby begged me please
So I went in town and told the law but they just laughed at me
But thirteen sticks of dynamite that night made quite a sound
And brought a big fine mansion tumbling to the ground
