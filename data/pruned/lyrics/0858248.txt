My face is starting to show it
This lyin' cheatin's took it's toll on me
But I'm starting to outgrow it
But I'm feeling so much better now
That you're not on my mind
And I can get on with my life
And I'm prayin' that the next love that I find
She don't do me like you did
They say it's better to love and lost
Than to have never loved at all
Hell I've done my share of losin'
That's a fact, and I don't have far to fall
But I'm feeling so much better now
That you're not on my mind
And I can get on with my life
And I'm prayin' that the next love that I find
She don't do me like you did
Well I'm feeling so much better now
That you're not on my mind
And I can get on with my life
And I'm prayin' that the next love that I find
She don't do me like you did
Don't love me like you did
Don't hurt me like you did
Don't leave me like you
And don't do me like youYou might also like
