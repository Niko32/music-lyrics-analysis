Will always be this gray
If I'll live my life in shadows
There are days I doubt that I can change
I think I'll always be this way
Not who You wanted me to be

But I believe there must be a hope
For this hopeless sinner
This I believe

[Chorus]
There is coming a day
When my faith shall be made sight
There is coming a day
Darkness shattered by the light
There is coming a day
Death is swallowed up forever
Tears are wiped away from every face
And my reproach He finally takes away
There is a coming a day

I know You're supposed to be the life
Still I hold so tight to mine
Faith is more than words
You are water, You are bread
Still I try to be comforted
By other things, it's hard to change
You might also likeBut I believe there must be healing
For this hurting saint
This I believe

[Chorus]
[Repeat: x4]
There is coming a day

I believe that there must be hope
For this hopeless sinner
This I believe

[Chorus]
[Repeat: x6]
There is coming a day
