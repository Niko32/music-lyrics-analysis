It was a beautiful Thursday
Sun beaming through my window pane
Then a strange rush of emotion awoke me
Eyes squint and strain to focus
Then I noticed an eerie blanket or tainted feeling
Filled my being "life walked me on yo yo string" instinct
Beckoning me to call my lady to converse
But the responses in the tele-talk stopped the chalk outlining my heart
Plan surprise visit
Get to the door
Listen before I knock
Hear a voice laughing
With your voice, I wonder who's the visitor
I knock and listen for feet pitter patter
To the peep hole
Scatter away
Youthful cat opens doors to say she's not there
"Now that's rare," I think
But I tell her Ill came by
I could tell the lie was killing him through his transparent eyes
Walking away from the domain
My thought plane takes flight
Idea after idea floating cause the happenings don't feel right
So I grab the cell, dial the digits, say "Hello"
She says, "Hi, that was my cousin, I was in the shower when you came by"
I was like, "Why'd he say you weren't there?"
"I don't know, but where you at?"
"I'm going to hit the store for some cigarettes but I'll be back"
Gave the dial tone but it still doesn't sit well
So I light the tip of my Camel
Then inhale
Back at the crib, I get there, she's getting ready to bounce
I'm like, "Where you goin?"
"To see my Aunt that just had a kid I told you about"
"Cool, how long you gonna be?"
"Just an hour. What, you coming back to see me?"
She was hoping I'd say no but I said yes to cause some stress
We exchange kisses, "I love you's", she jets and I chill
Cause I can't dismiss this discontentment I feel
Park in a spot, cloaked by the dark, 20 minutes skip on the clock
She comes back, the shock beats my chest, anger fills the rest of me
Regretfully, I go to her door, knock and get no answer
Evil's eating away at my sanity like mind cancer
So I run to her balcony, look in the window and explode
Some cat with his lips touching the beauty that I behold?
By this time I lost my sanity
Climbed up on a 6 foot balcony
Love and hate combined by, some weird type alchemy
She sees me, stands there shocked and scared
She was frost bitten by the ice grill of my stare
Dude bounces, she tries to explain, make sense of the lies
The pain of my words inflict, burst her heart she starts to cry
Thinking of ways for revenge, her tears encourage the rage
Internally, I'm an animal ready to shatter my cage
She comes for a hug, I tense up, flooding my shirt with pain
Looks up with ducts busted, quietly says my name
Sits me down on the couch, kisses my neck unzips my pants
Thinking of ways to take revenge and she opens the chance
Hit it for a nice amount of time, made her cum for miles and miles
Pulled up my pants with no words, hit the door looked back and smiled...You might also like
