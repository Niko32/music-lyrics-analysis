Hey baby
I see you got your suitcases all packed and things
You not going no place
Let me tell you something right here now
You're my girl
Everybody sing, you're my girl

[Verse 1]
I don't want to discuss it
There ain't no even chance
I don't want to discuss it
'Cause I know just a-where you're at now
Listen, baby

[Chorus]
You're my girl
Everybody sing, you're my girl
And baby, that's that
Ooh, baby, that's that

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna talk about it
'Cause I know what you're gonna say
I don't want to discuss it
Don't talk, don't say a word
I don't want to discuss it
'Cause I don't like what I heard
Now, sing it, baby
You might also like[Chorus]
You're my girl
Everybody, you're my girl
And baby, that's that
Ooh, baby, that's that

[Verse 3]
Don't wanna talk about it
'Cause I know what you're gonna say
You're gonna say, "I hope you'll understand"
Whenever he looks your way
You just can't help yourself
And you forget about us
You can't figure out where you're gonna stay

[Bridge]
I'm saying I (I)
I'm saying I (I)
I'm saying I (I)
Don't wanna discuss it
Don't wanna talk about it
'Cause I know what you're gonna say

[Outro]
Singing, you're my girl
Everybody, you're my girl
Let it all go, you're my girl
Sing it loud, everybody, you're my girl
I know that you're my girl
I believe that you're my girl
