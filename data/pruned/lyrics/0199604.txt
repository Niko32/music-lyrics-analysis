I wanna show you baby if you realy want to see
All the reasons why, you should ride
And I want to love you baby
Only when its right
If only for tonight you should ride with me

(Verse) SEMU
& I rememeber when I saw you there
Couldn't wait to take you to my lair
Saw ya there, and I felt ya when i pull ya close
Wanna stay we have a toast
Say that you want to leave
I say baby girl you sould role with me
How you feel about that
You should ride
You should ride with me
Ride with me

(Hook #2)

(Verse #2)
Come and catch a vibe
Get to know just whats inside
And I realy do see you in my future
When I look up in ya eyes
No other place in the world id rather be
No other girl that I want to be next to me
And whenever that im alone
I want to get you home and get you gone
