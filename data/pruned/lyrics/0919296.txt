Black as open graves
Devoid of life
Born to serve the slaves

Upon the stakes
We've placed our enemies
From naught, to none
Pleading on their knees

Dethroned creation
Into deaths cold embrace
We crawl, from existence
Staggering on
To reap as we've sown

We rise and fall
As we hate, we loathe
Erase it all
A clean decisive blow

Without remorse
No fucking reason why
A burning cloud
Beneath a burning sky
You might also likeCreation
Into deaths cold embrace
We fall, towards damnation
Staggering on
To reap as we've sown

Begone you failing breed
Unto the earth unleashed
Destroy the virgin seed
A path to ruin now so clear

This path is ridden with despair
The shreds of faith lie buried here

Dethroned creation
Into deaths cold embrace
We crawl, from existence
Staggering on
To reap as we've sown
To reap as we've sown

Dethroned creation, into dead cold embrace, we crawl
