Got one hand in the water, the other in the sand
Two beers in a cooler, one warm heart in place
Got a picture in a bottle, one nailed up to a palm tree
One out in the wind and they all look like me
I want somebody to be the feeling's all over my face

Oh, I've never been more ready than I am right now
I know sooner or later, someday, somehow
Somebody's gonna walk up
An' join somebody sittin' right here
So wherever, whoever you are
The coast is clear

I close my eyes and the sound of the waves
Carries me forward to better days
An' they open my eyes to the woman of my dreams strolling in
With a small touch of shyness an' a smooth kind of style
She kisses me on the cheek and she says with a smile:
"I've been waiting all my life for you, baby. Where have you been?"

Oh, I've never been more ready than I am right now
I know sooner or later, someway, somehow
Somebody's gonna walk up
An' join somebody sittin' right here
So wherever, whoever you are
The coast is clear
You might also likeGirl, wherever, whoever you are
The coast is clear

Afternoon low tide, I'm just workin' my plan
Right now, right here
The coast is clear
Oh, yeah
