Oh no, no, no, no...

[Chorus]
Ooo...C-A-R-A-M-E-L
Sticky nights in a desert motel
In the shadow of the Summertime
Alright, I'm singing
Ooo...C-A-R-A-M-E-L
Am I never gonna break this spell
In the shadow of the Summertime?

[Verse 1]
Said, "you can order, any favour"
But she only got one flavour
Yeah, I been eating bad things
Inner saccharine with an outer-shell, 19 stings
Sugar walls made a prison, got me thinking mad things
Now she steals in my room every page in my homework

[Chorus]
Ooo...C-A-R-A-M-E-L
Sticky nights in a desert motel
In the shadow of the Summertime
Alright, I'm singing
Ooo...C-A-R-A-M-E-L
Am I never gonna break this spell
In the shadow of the Summertime?

Too sweet but you're my saviour [x3]
...in the Summertime

[Verse 2]
I'm-a praying, I'm-a phasing
Cause the craving's fucking amazing
I'm dripping insulin;
Glucose, sucrose - bet you let your new boyfriend binge
I'm ADHD (ADHD) since I ate the whole damn thing
Now she steals in my room every page in my homework

[Outro]
Oh no, no, no, no...
