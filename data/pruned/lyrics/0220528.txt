Always blinded for you
Then your love shifted like the wild wind
Drifting to another soul

The notice was short that you gave me
Thin was the time that I knew
Life without your love has no meaning
But your kind of loving won't do
Your kind of loving won't do

Someday if you change I'll be waiting
As you know I always have done
But I know in my heart that it's hopeless
While in your heart I'm fool number one

But a fool likes to go right on thinking
For pleasure sometime are so few
My kind of loving was your kind
But your kind of loving won't do
Your kind of loving won't doYou might also like
