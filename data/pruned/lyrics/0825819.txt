I bless the day I found you, honey
And you don't even know
How I even love to stay around you
But oh, if you would do me just one small favor
Do this, honey, please let it be me

[Chorus]
Don't take this heaven from one
If you must cling to someone
Now and forever
Let it be me
Now listen

[Verse 1]
Each time you need love
I fight complete love, yes I do
And oh, without your sweet love
What would life be?

[Chorus]
Don't ever leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
Now and forever, ah yeah
Let it be me

If you don't mind, I would like to say this

[Verse 2]
Oh, each time we meet, love
Oh, I don't find nothing but sweet love, baby
Oh, without your sweet love
What would life be?

[Chorus]
Don't ever leave me lonely
Tell me you love me only
Now and forever, ah yeah
Let it be me
Listen to this, now

[Outro]
Now and for always
Let it be me, ooh hoo
Now and for always
