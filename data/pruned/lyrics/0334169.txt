VERSE 1

U.f.o you find you fold
You run you're not your soul
U.f.o you fly ,you can't really stop
Everything falls,here we go

U.f.o you find you fold you fast
Your fear wants to last ,you just want to go
Fo fo focus on my veins
Your oil can not flow flow flow
Britain is a pub ,Britney is too old/owned

U.f.o you find your phone
Your mothership makes a call,they swear
Mexico has no more alcohol
So give them une femme objet ,a myth or an ufo song
For they keep on play
For they keep on bet
For they keep on prey all night long

You pretend ,we re not from ,from that land we re alien
You pretend ,we're from space ,i can guess ,but it's late
I'm a man ,i'm human,i want love ,i'm your god
You might also likeCHORUS

And i ,belonged to your heart ,i've lost
Until i knew that  you sold it
You sell it for lies i eat
We sail into the void
I quit

U.f.o you find you fold
You run you're not your soul
U.f.o you fly ,you can't really stop
Everything falls,here we go

VERSE 2

(FR lyrics )

Je crées le chaos dans les méandres de ta mémoire
Comme un fléau
Tu flottes ici bas et t'emmures d'armure endiablé par le haut
Parrain, défaut ,parano ,par par année
Par anneau

(ENG Translation)

(I created chaos into the twists and turns of your memory
Like a scourge
You float down here and you walled yourself with a furious armor by the top
Godfather, paranoid, by year
To ring.)
You pretend ,we re not from ,from that land we re alien
You pretend ,we're from space ,i can guess ,but it's late
I'm a man ,i'm human,i want love ,i'm your god

CHORUS

And i ,belonged to your heart ,i've lost
Until i knew that  you sold it
You sell it for lies i eat
We sail into the void
I quit
