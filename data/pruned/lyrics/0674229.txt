Look in my face when you talkin'
Now before you walk-in, watch me
'for you end up in a coffin
This ain't nothing like that safe shit you used to
So watch me close, don't let me lose you
Them streetrats'll abuse you, uh
Where I'm from, we don't ever see the sun
We don't run, slum dwellers be lookin up to the gun
Looking out for them one's
So you got some shit poppin? gimme some
I don't know you? we movin, don't gimme none
Out here, you getting hung
Cuz the number one rule is, the rules don't apply
Son it's eye-for-an-eye
Come alive in the night
Shine from the light of the stars
That's the closest we getting to living large
We smoking and drinking hard
On a mission to see tomorrow
Thinking how we'd be chillin if we made it past the guards
Show membership through the scars
You ain't earn em? looking nervous? then you hurtin
Outsiders ain't welcome to hear the sermon
This is 3rd world learnin
You burning from the sun or the sultan
Stomach hurtin then you better get to huntin
Get to stuntin 'round here and get raided
Ain't nothing nickel-plated
But for nickels, them jackals'll get ya faded
Shackled up in the basement
Headwraps and AK's
Kaly up in the tape deck, blasting to make a statement
And success ain't worth chasin
Wishin is just a waste
To fellas that never tasted no better besides a razor
Tucked under they tongue, to us, this shits basic
Death to all the racists, caste system enslave us
Give a fuck how they portray us, Petraeus couldn't even slay us
Consider this all a wake up, you fellas could never break us
We been broke!
Fucker, we been choking!
Born in the hash smoke, fast forward, we blast on you assholes
Born in the shadow of the palace with full beards
Looking for something better? forget it, don't ever look there
Show no fear, my brother we cook tears
Live and die on the strength of your word, don't be scared
Now be sure before you take that step if you dare
Don't you come around here if you ain't really prepared, uhYou might also like
