I don't know what to do
My cup is running over
I don't know what to do
No, I don't know
No, I don't know

[Chorus]
Guess I gotta cry, cry, cry
People, let me cry, cry, cry
I'd feel a little bit better
If I cry, cry, cry

My cup is overflowing
I don't know what to do
My cup is overflowing
I don't know what to do
No, I don't know
No, I don't know

[Chorus]
When I, I lost you
I lost the best thing I ever had
Now that I, I realize, oh
It makes me, it makes me
It makes me so bad
You might also likeMy cup is running over
I don't know what to do
My cup is running over
I don't know what to do
No, I don't know
No, I don't know

[Chorus]
Just let me cry, people
How do you feel
How do you feel
When you see a man cry

People, let me cry
I'm not ashamed
I'm not ashamed
Guess I gotta walk away now
Just let me walk away
Just let me walk away
Just let me walk away
