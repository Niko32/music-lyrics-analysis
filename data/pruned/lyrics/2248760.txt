Said the Thief to the Moon, "I'll extinguish your light soon
I'll put an end to all the light that you shed on this world in its darkened state"
Said the Moon to the Thief, "You know not of what you seek
You'll doom the world to wander the night with no light to guide the paths that men seek"

[Bridge]
"Oh, but all the wealth in the world will be mine
Without a means of defense for all those blind
My very existence is a race to attain wealth
For the thief's only loyalty in life is to the Devil and himself"

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
"The earth will rise up and devour all that you are
The skies will call forth thunderous storms from afar
When you're dead, there'll be no grave to remember your name
For your greed brings your end and there's no one but yourself to blame"You might also like
