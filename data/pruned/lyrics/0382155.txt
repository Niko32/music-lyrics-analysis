Wanna be a pretty boy
Wanna go on Solid Gold
Wanna date a millionaire
Wanna make people stare

[Chorus]
I wanna be on T.V
Want people to know me
I wanna be on T.V

[Verse 2]
Studio 54
Gonna be out on the floor
Wanna make people dance
Gonna take off my pants

[Chorus]
I wanna be on T.V
Want people to know me
I wanna be on T.V

[Verse 3]
Gonna wanna make a scene
Gonna get some free cocaine
Wanna wear my Calvin Klein's
Then the world will be all mine
You might also like[Chorus]
I wanna be on TV
Want people to know me
I wanna be on TV
