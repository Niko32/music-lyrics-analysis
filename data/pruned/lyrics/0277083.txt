We should be lovers, inside this gold locket
That you'd cherish dearly
Clearly I fell for you hard and I sincerely
Apologize If I'm coming on a tad too strong
I can play along
We can do whatever you wanna do
Like drink or smoke from bongs
I heard your brother has the best weed
Yeah I'll tag along too
I knew from first instinct
That you would make my heart extinct and vanish
When you are not around I need a bandage
Even if I act like I'm not interested in you
I can't stand it
I wanna be a thing, I wanna talk
Any guy who stops me from you is now considered a cockblock
Like a nocturnal hawk
Sometimes I make a long walk to stand outside your house and stalk
I look through the window and see you trying on so many clothes
I placed that confessional letter I composed
And a rose
At your welcome mat beside the rack for the water hose
You always turn me on
Especially, when your shoes are open toe
Always hard, Even with snot under your nose

The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
You touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window, He's at your window

[ Verse 2: Nalyd Ecitsuj ]
As soon as that night light turns off
I pull my skinny jeans down as I begin to jack off
To your features
Be my queen
I make admiring you a routine
You toss and turn all night you must be lonely
One night I crept through your window to keep you warm and cozy
It's me from U.S VA History
Dylan the one and only
Why you screaming the S word with the holy
You throwing random items
Like you don't even know me
The I realized I still had on my mask
I take it off nervously
Then it actually becomes a difficult task
Then you dispatch the police
Your parents said I was disturbing the peace
I thought you loved me back
I thought we had something going
Red & Blue lights flash
Wakes up the entire neighborhood
I guess my love for you is misunderstood
Bangin' my head against the Five O's unforgiving glass
Wondering how Monday will pass
Am I going to jail?
I don't know, I guess I'll see ya fine ass on Monday in class
[Hook: Frank Ocean ]
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'

You touch yourself after hours

You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window, He's at your window

[ Verse 3: Nalyd Ecitsuj ]
One, Two You are the girl that I want
Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven shit
Eight is the bullets if you say no after all this
And I just couldn't take it
You're so motherfuckin' gorgeous
Gorgeous baby you're gorgeous
I wanna just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest and fornicate it
To this beat
I am in love with you, Cunt
I just wanna talk
And conversate
Because I usually just Stalk
And masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes
Let the future fall to place
I just wanna talk
And conversate
Because I usually just Stalk
And masturbate
And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes
Let the future fall to place
