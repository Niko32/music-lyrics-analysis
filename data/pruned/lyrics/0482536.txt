I left my favorite cassette in the escape car
I'll never hear those songs again
It made me think of all the many things I've sacrificed
Oh, mama, where do I begin?

[Pre-Chorus]
When I broke bad
I never knew 'bout all this trouble I would have

[Chorus]
You should not romanticize this outlaw life
When the scars have been shown and the tales have been told
I'm telling you - something's missing
Don't make no excuse to sing the blues
Calculating the cost and the things that you lost
You'll realize - love's gone missing
Don't go drifting

[Verse 2]
I'm losing count when recalling all that I regret
How many missteps are enough?
Who of the few I call friends will be by my side
When, without recourse, life gets tough?

[Pre-Chorus]
When I broke bad
I never knew 'bout all this trouble I would have
You might also like[Chorus]
You should not romanticize this outlaw life
When the scars have been shown and the tales have been told
I'm telling you - something's missing
Don't make no excuse to sing the blues
Calculating the cost and the things that you lost
You'll realize - love's gone missing
Don't go drifting
