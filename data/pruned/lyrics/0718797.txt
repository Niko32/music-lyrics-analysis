The best two gunman in the land
I could shoot the ace of diamonds
With a draw from either hand
With the dice I had no equal
Some of them are with us now
Most of them are sadly sleeping
'Neath the weeping willow bough
Many a cowboy's game I've played in
Left that night with all their gold
As a sport I was broken
As a sport I let it go

I once loved a girl named Nellie
How we loved no tongue can tell
But I know, I'll never meet her
Oh, it was hard to say farewell
Her eyes were like the deep blue water
And her hair was golden curls
And her cheeks were crimson velvet
And her teeth were snow white pearls
Together we lived in a cottage
And our life, it was a dream
And the angels they watched o'er us
Made our life one happy dreamYou might also like
