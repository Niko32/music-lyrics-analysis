Oh
This is dedicated to you

[Verse: Aubrey & Shannon]
Crossing paths
I saw the past
Realized how good
It was (It was)
The smell of your scent
Feel of your touch
Memory had me
Gone (Uh)

[Pre-chorus: D. Woods & Dawn]
But you're with her
And not with me now
And I wonder if
You think of me, how
(I think of you when I'm)
(Lying in bed)
And the image of you loving her
Plays in my head

[Chorus]
You messed up and you lost (Whoa)
A real good thing (You messed up, whoa)
And now, you're asking
Why (Why, why, why)
You messed up and you lost (You messed up)
A real good thing (And now, you're asking why)
And now, you're asking (Why)
Why (Did you do this to me)
You might also likeYou messed up and you lost
A real good thing (Baby)
And now, you're asking (Baby, baby)
Why (Baby)
You messed up and you lost (She could never, no)
A real good thing (Love you, baby, no)
And now, you're asking (She could never)
Why (Love you, no)
