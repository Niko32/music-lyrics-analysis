It's been such a long time
Since I set foot in the club
I really hate this shit, don’t I?
I hate feeling rushed, girl, can I just be honest?
I don't feel like talkin' unless it’s 'bout me, or philosophy
Can we just get down to business?
And when we're both finished, then we'll have a reason to speak

[Chorus]
Then you can open up to me, girl
Let me plant my seed, girl
Let me fill your needs, girl
Open up to me, open up to me

[Verse 2]
The piano that I fuck you on
Same one that on which I write these songs for you
They're one in the same
That goes for us, too, I give you my name
The bed on which I lay to sleep
And lay with you and lay in deep
There ain't no difference, this case there isn't
That goes for us, too, I know you're listenin’
Sometimes it feels like I don’t really care
One day you'll see, but in the meantime
Just trust that I’m there
Just trust that I love you
Just trust that I care
Trust that I need you to always be there
Trust that you know me well enough to know
I'm the high priest but you put on the show
You might also like[Chorus]
Then you can open up to me, girl
Let me plant my seed, girl
Let me fill your needs, girl
Open up to me, open up to—

[Outro]
It's been such a long time
Since I set foot in the club
