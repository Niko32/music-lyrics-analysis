You know I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
You know I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you

[Verse 1]
Hey, my life is real great, feel I'm well on my way to my dreams coming true and I'm getting to do it with you
And it feels so nice when the people sing along, they're singing along with the banjo

[Chorus]
But I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
You know I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you

[Verse 2]
And one day we might have a big house with nice cars and fancy clothes and a wife with a big ol' diamond ring
Cause the people they dancing along, they dancing along to the mando' and some sort of hip-hop beat

[Chorus]
But I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
And I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you

I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up
I'm waking up

[Chorus]
But I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you
And I'd take it all back, take it all back, take it all back
I'd take it all back just to have you

[Outro]
Hey, my life is real great, feel I'm well on my way to my dreams coming true and I'm getting to do with you
