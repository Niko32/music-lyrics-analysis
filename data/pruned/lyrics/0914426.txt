I did some honky tonk healin' to get me over you
It took some neon nurses around the clock to pull me through
I was in critical condition, my heart was broken in two
But due to honky tonk healin', I'm feeling good as new

[Verse 1]
Well, thank you for calling is all I can say
'Cause your get well wishes dear, are just a little too late
Did you think I'd be laid up, heartbroken and blue
And misssin' your kissin', well honey, here's the news:

[Chorus]
I did some honky tonk healin' to get me over you
It took some neon nurses around the clock to pull me through
I was in critical condition, my heart was broken in two
But due to honky tonk healin', I'm feeling good as new

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Drop by some evening, if you can catch me home
We'll share a few memories, if that's what you want
Don't be expecting the same fool you left crying in vain
It's been a smooth operation, they removed all the pain
