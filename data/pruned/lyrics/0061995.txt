For this feeling
In the darkness
And in pain
And I’m falling
Hands are broken
Through the black light
Into the void
Stones are turning
I hear the call
I go down down down where I was strong
There’s a place beneath the flames where I come from
When I go back to where the shadows fall
I will lay in arms of evil evermore
Yeah

I walk alone through desolation
Sky is burning
Fields decay
Lightning strikes down
Weekend soldiers
I’m still standing on my grave
Stones are turning
I hear the call

I go down down down where I was strong
There’s a place beneath the flames where I come from
When I go back to where the shadows fall
I will lay in arms of evil evermore
Yeah
