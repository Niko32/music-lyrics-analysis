I left my girl back home, I let my girl let go
And now I'm all alone, out here trying to get on
I think of you everyday, just thought I'd make that known
That I'll be back and you better believe that I can give you a better me
So let your seat back this my specialty my reverie with melody

I plotted robbing for promo cheese to drop this album
Thought of statistics then said fuck it man them thoughts I trashed em'
They probably laugh at him then harass him and then outcast him
Watch how I smash em' and run on past em' and then outlast em'
I mixed this album on speakers financed by Ricky Brascom
Via Mike B, for the right fee he'll make you some magic
For this shit we some addicts, this shit bouta be tragic
This shit bouta get drastic, this shit bout be classic


(keep, keep holding em)
This shit bouta be classic
My nigga DT said this sound like some old school shit
This shit bouta be classic
Like how I come in with them muthafuckin horns nigga, thats me on the damn guitars nigga thats me on everything

This shit bouta be classic
The production fantastic
Engineering ain't average
Nigga ego Jurassic
All my people is ratchet
Private trio for taxes
Lawyers still contracted
This a real enactment
This is real combat bitch
And i'm still intact, shit (right here)
This ain't baptist or catholic
This that straight out the crack shit
This that ain't hit the rack shit
Yea that still in the back shit
Bouta pop up like acne
If you feel it then back me
You on twitter then @ me
Got a question DM me
Never stressing I'm friendly
Count our blessings and then we
Be right there where the sin be
Man I gotta pray mo' bruh
And say no to these hoes bruh
I believe in Jehovah
Hope he Let Me Grow Older
