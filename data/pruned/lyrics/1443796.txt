Make me down a pallet on your floor
Make me down
Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor

[Verse 1]
Up the country, 20 miles more
I'm going up the country by the cold sleet and snow
I'm going up the country by the cold sleet and slow
No telling how much further I may go

[Chorus]
Just make me down
Make me down
Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor

[Verse 2]
'Way sleeping, my back and shoulders tired
'Way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired
The way I'm sleeping, my back and shoulders tired
Gonna turn over and try it on this side

[Chorus]
Oh make me down
Make me down
Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor
You might also like[Verse 3]
Don't you let my good girl catch you here
Don't let my good girl catch you here
Oh she might shoot you, might cut and starve you too
No telling what she might do

[Chorus]
Just make me down
Make me down
Make me a pallet down, soft and low
Make me a pallet on your floor

[Verse 4]
Make it baby close behind the door
Make it baby close behind the door
Make me a pallet close behind the door
Make it where your good man'll never go

[Chorus]
Oh make me down
Make me down
Make me a pallet down on your floor
Make me a pallet on your floor
