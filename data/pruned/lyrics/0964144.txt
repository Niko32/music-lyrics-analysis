I could fly?
Could we watch the world grow small
From the sky?
Set across and leave this place
For a while
We would leave
We would see
The world a different size

Let's fly a rocketship off the ground
Come on and break through the speed of sound

Sometimes I feel caged inside
My life span
If I saw the earth as a
Distant land
All my problems would feel like
Grains of sand
Sifted through
Sifted through
Sifted through my hands

Let's fly a rocketship off the ground
Come on and break through the speed of sound

And time
Died so we don't have
To die

Jesus above space
And time
Died so we don't have
To die

Have to die
Have to die
Have to die
Have to die

Jesus above space
And time
Died so we don't have
To die

Let's fly a rocketship off the ground
Come on and break through the speed of sound
