This is how we do it
Down at the jook joint
We do it easy
At the end - of the day

Baby, just let me play
Just for you

This is how we - gently do it
Down here - at the jook joint
Baby, at the end - of the day
Baby, just let me play
All - night - long
Just - for you
It's supposed to feel this way
Baby, at the end - of the day
Yes, baby, I do it
This is the only way
Every day should be your day
Every day you should feel this wayYou might also like
