Amongst the swamps and the Everglades
There's a big old hole in Tiger Mountain
God help the man who gets lost in Miller's Cave

I had me a girl in Waycross, Georgia
But she had unfaithful ways
She made me feel I was unwanted
Like the bats and the bears in Miller's Cave

I caught her out Sunday morning
With some guy they called Big Dave
The meanest man in Waycross, Georgia
I'd rather fight a mountain lion in Miller's Cave

So I said, "You're gonna pay both you and Davy
'Cause I'm gonna see you in your graves"
And they laughed at me and then I shot 'em
And then I dragged their cheatin' skin and bones to Miller's Cave

I couldn't stand the way she did me
Well I guess I showed her I was brave
Most wanted man in the state of Georgia
They're never gonna find me 'cause I'm lost in Miller's CaveYou might also like
