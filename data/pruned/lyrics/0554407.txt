And all along, we're livin' in the shadow
Yeah, you wonder how your favorite life did not pay off
A life I always loved until I knew you
(Ooooh, Ooooh)

Don't know why I need you, I don't need anyone
Don't know why I need you, I don't need anyone
I'm the last man runnin'

When I'm down on my luck, show me a good time
When I'm hot as a match, give me a punching bag
How we walk along the dock and watch the shadows fall
The crying gulls and I cry even more

Don't know why I need you, I don't need anyone
Don't know why I need you, I don't need anyone
I'm the last man runnin'
I'm the last man runnin'

And in the northern light
Our directions swing together
Oh, I was wrong - I was right
Our directions swing together
(Ahhh, la la la la)
Our directions swing together
Our directions swing togetherYou might also like
