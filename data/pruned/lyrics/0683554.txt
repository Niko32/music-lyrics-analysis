Oh my goodness I'm such a lucky girl
Cause all my goodness comes from his world
When separation breaks us apart
Then all the goodness still warms my heart
Oh my goodness what would I be
Without your goodness to watch over me
When situations keep us apart
That old goodness he's still all my heartYou might also like
