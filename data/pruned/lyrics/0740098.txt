I was like
Yo, yo, yo
What you doing over there?
Cause that's a no, no, no
I can hear you loud and clear

What's the deal-eal, yo?
I know you didn't just go there
But now that you did
I gotta get rid of you
And yo, ho for-sho
Oh, yo

[Verse 1:]
It was on a regular day
When I called to say hi to my man
I knew something was strange
When he quickly said hello and bye

And I just paused for a second
And called him back
He answered on the fifth ring
And didn't know how to act
He replied he was busy

[Verse 2:]
By now I was heated
I was being mistreated by my man
So I hung up the phone
Raced to his place
Doing 80

And I arrived
Hurried to the door
Burst right in
There he was kissing my friend
They looked up at me
He knew that it was the end

[Repeat Chorus:]

[Bridge:]
When I walked in on the two of them
I couldn't believe my eyes
My mouth was lost for words
But my heart broke down and cried

He tried to explain
It's not what you think
We were just watching TV
But the TV wasn't on
Do you think I'm a fool?
Just admit you were wrong
[Repeat Chorus x2:]
