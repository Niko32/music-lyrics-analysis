Gee but it's lonely being alone may as well go home
Got on my suit my shoes are shined all dressed up for a real good time
Gee but it's lonely being alone might as well go home
What's wrong with me that I can't find someone for my own
Why should I be left behind left to be alone
The girl I asked out told me a lie there she goes with some guy
Gee but it's lonely being alone guess I'll go on home
Guess I'll go on home guess I'll go on home guess I'll go on homeYou might also like
