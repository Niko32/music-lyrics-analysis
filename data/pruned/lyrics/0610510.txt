It's hard describing a heartache
All because it's a one of a kind of thing
A serious injury
And a whole lot of endless pain
If it was a storm
I'd compare it to a hurricane
Oh, it's even got a name

[Chorus]
If it was a drink
It would be a strong one
If it was a sad song
It would be a long one
If it was a color
It would be a deep, deep blue
But if we're talking about a heartache
It would be you

[Verse 2]
If there was a full moon
It would be a total eclipse
If it was a tidal wave
It would sink a thousand ships
If it was a blizzard
It would be a record breaking cold
If it was a lie
It would be the biggest story you've ever told
You might also like[Chorus]
If it was a drink
It would be a strong one
If it was a sad song
It would be a long one
If it was a color
It would be a deep, deep blue
But if we're talking about a heartache
It would be you

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
If it was a color
It would be a deep, deep blue
But if we're talking about a heartache
It would be you
