I want you
You're too busy watching other girls
In the little skirts, with their pretty curls
Why don't you
Hot one you know you want it
Then when you find you got it
You call me

I hear you talking like
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
You like me better in my underwear
When I try to kiss you, you get scared
Why don't you
Leave me, go out the door
I can't handle your shit anymore

I hear you talking like
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH

I hear you talking like
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
BLAH BLAH BLAH BLAH
