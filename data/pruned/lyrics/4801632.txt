In another time, in another place
You would be mine
On a brighter day, under a different sky
Maybe we'd fly

[Chorus]
Good girl, I knew you were a good girl
That's all I ever fall for, the kind I lose it all for
Yes, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time with the right one
Now you think you're tryna help, oh
But you can't save me from myself, ooh
No, you can't save me from myself, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I keep reminding myself
I wasn't here for the view
Just 'cause we seem like we care
Didn't really mean that we care
I didn't run from the truth
I was just keepin' it real
And our conversation was good, ooh

[Chorus]
'Cause you're a good girl, I knew you were a good girl
That's all I ever fall for, the kind I lose it all for
Yes, I was in the wrong place at the wrong time with the right one
Now you think you're tryna help
But you can't save me from myself, ooh
No, you can't save me from myself, ooh, ooh
You might also like[Outro]
That was reasonable
