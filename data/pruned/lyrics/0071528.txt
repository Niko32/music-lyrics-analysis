Every child grows up
With the hope of being something special in life
But what happens when the one that they depend on the most
(I need, I needed you)
Is never there?

[Verse 1]
Told that I was supposed to fail
I wouldn't amount to much of nothing
Yes, I pray
There was days I wondered if you really loved me
But, baby, you feel pain
Mama was sane when I felt like running away
I couldn't take it
I soon hit ten, angry with all of the world
I couldn't keep friends, just wishing you'd come back and see
My difficult times being an adolescent
And like so many just like me without a shoulder to lean

[Chorus]
I needed you
When I needed a father figure
I needed you
To stop me from makin' the wrong decisions
At seventeen
When the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was callin' me
Didn't know which way to go
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
I needed you
I need, I needed you
I needed you
I need, I need you
At seventeen
When the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was callin' me
Didn't know which way to go

[Verse 2]
Mama had no financial help
And thoughts of breakin' the law came
Seein' her tryna hold down two jobs
Was tearin' up on me
Had a way (Had a way)
All my friends was gettin' it in
It came time for me to get that dough
Wrong or right
I had to go for what I know

[Chorus]
I needed you
When I needed a father figure
I needed you
To stop me from makin' the wrong decisions
At seventeen
When the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was callin' me
Didn't know which way to go
[Post-Chorus]
I needed you
I need, I needed you
I needed you
I need, I need you
At seventeen
When the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was callin' me
Didn't know which way to go

[Outro]
Lord, I pray
Give me strength to forgive them and not hold all the I hate I got
Even though the pain some days was too heavy
Lord, I pray
Show my younger brothers growin' up without a father
How to turn what they have less into a legacy
Lord, I pray
From the knowledge I ain't get, God, you gave me
When temptations was callin' me
Didn't know which way to go
