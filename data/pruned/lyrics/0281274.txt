Now I know nothing about that save the world shit//
But I know money, money, money make the world spin//
In this world of sin, I indulge in it, it keep calling me//
I need another hit of BASS!, BASS!, BASS!, BASS!//(Repeat)

[Verse 1: Dagger$]
I'm trynna rock designers, your shit come from China//
You cop from the Ahki, those knock-off Nike's//
I got type G, blood in me, wanna bet a pretty penny many//
Sprinkle dirt on my name like jimmies//
I'm exuberate'd, niggas wanna hate it//
Niggas falling dey job, like it's work related//
I'm so aggravated, ni-ni-ni-niggas styles out dated//
I dedicate this, to my brothers//
One's locked up, one's above us//
Pray for us, we all soldiers//
And our proto-col, is a secret, shhh don't say shit//
Penicillin scripts, for a nigga spittin' with a mouth like this//
No thoughts, brain farts, with them flows you rip//
Pure excellence magnificence//
Hey! what can I say T.A.E. got taste//
This bass ain't no safe zone, it's a 808!//

[Hook: Dagger$]
Now I know nothing about that save the world shit//
But I know money, money, money make the world spin//
In this world of sin, I indulge in it, it keep calling me//
I need another hit of BASS!, BASS!, BASS!, BASS!//(Repeat)
