There was a time when you could see that spark behind your eyes
When your heart felt like an amber glow into the night
Why did you let it fade?
It didn't matter if the walls rose up into the sky
You were a climber, I could see the view from way up high
Why did you fall to earth?
You got to reignite, feel the flame about to die
What's the use in all this cry?

[Chorus:]
Light it up, light it up, light it up
Light it up, light it up
And let it rage inside, start up your WILDFIRE
Light it up, light it up, light it up
Light it up, light it up
Just follow where it takes you
Start up your WILDFIRE

[Verse II:]
I can see all of the signs of strain begin to show
Time fractures on the edge of sea and volcanoes
Why are you letting go?
Just let yourself explode
You got to reignite, feel the flame about to die
What's the use in all this cry?
You might also like[Chorus]

[Chorus II:][x2]
Oh, you gotta run, run, run, run, run
Oh, you gotta run, run free and wild
Yeah, you better run, run, run, run
And get off the way cause our fire's coming

[Outro:]
Start up your WILDFIRE
Light it up, light it up, light it up
Light it up, light it up
And let it rage inside, start up your WILDFIRE
