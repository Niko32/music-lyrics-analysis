Abilene Abilene prettiest town that I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean in Abilene sweet Abilene

[Verse 1]
I sat alone most every night watched the trains pull out of sight
Don't I wish they were carryin' me back to Abilene my Abilene

[Chorus]
Abilene oh Abilene prettiest town that I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean in Abilene sweet Abilene

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Crowded city there ain't nothing free nothin' in this town for me
Wish to the Lord that I could be back in Abilene sweet Abilene

[Chorus]
Abilene oh Abilene prettiest town that I've ever seen
Women there don't treat you mean in Abilene sweet Abilene
Women there don't treat you mean in Abilene my AbileneYou might also like
