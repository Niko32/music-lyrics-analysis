I'm not gonna talk about you in it
Except to say, I burned the teddy bear you gave me
Well, not really, but I thought about it real hard

This is take two of getting over you
Why do they call it that?
I feel so low, low to the ground
I could been a wevel
Did you know that they are herbivores?
They don't eat meat
I wonder if they break hearts

[Chorus]
I will remember what it's like to feel entire
I will remember what it's like to feel entire
I will remember what it's like to feel entire
I'm not a puzzle piece, I am the whole damn frame

This is a love song for myself
I really hope I like it
I think that me could really use some spoiling
I'm gonna paint my toenails green
Walk around like my feet are the front lawn
And I am, and I am, and I am a castle
You can call me Alcazar
You might also like[Chorus]

The whole frame
Whole frame

[Outro]
This is a love song for myself
And nobody, nobody, nobody else
