And does the world deserve us?
Application rushing through

A long time coming
Yes, it's been a long time coming

My loving you is a place where I surrender
In my heart, it's not hard to do
And all my worldly goods I give to you

We close our eyes and chase away the sorry things
You make it easy for me, life is but a dream

Cried on your shoulder
Dove into the great blue yonder

And my loving you is a place where I surrender
Touch my heart, it's not hard to do
And all my worldly goods I give to you
Loving you is a place where I surrender
In my heart, no catch 22
And all my worldly goods I give to you

No misdemeanour
There's a ring upon my finger
You might also likeMy loving you is a place where I surrender
In my heart, it's not hard to do
And all my worldly goods I give to you
Loving you is a place where I surrender
Touch my heart, no catch 22
And all my worldly goods I give to you
