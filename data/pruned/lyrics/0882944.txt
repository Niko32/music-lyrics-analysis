And all you have seen
Remember some faces
From the places you've been
And then there's a sadness
When you try to describe
How these things can happen
And the passing of time
The end of the journey
And all you have seen
Remember some faces
From the places you've been
And there's a sadness
When you try to describe
How these things can happen
And the passing of time
And the passing of time
And the passing of time
The passing of time
