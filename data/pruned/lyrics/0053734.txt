Mr.1st Impression, Lil muthafuckin Ace
Ima go hard so try to keep up with my pace
I'm fuckin tired cuz this world is a big race
Hate this ghetto life so I'm on a paper chase
Writing this shit on my iPod that's the way I do
Latin Hustle hustler gotta keep it cool
Sittin on a chair, I don't sit on a stool
I'm a hip-hop genius and you're a stupid ass fool
E, Flow, & Woods, Part of the Latin Hustle crew
Yutziri, Teresa, & Nydia they cool with us too
1 fuckin voice killin this rap game again
Lil fuckin Ace killin this rap shit again
Latin fuckin Hustle on fuckin top again
Fuck being a loser we will always win
13 years old, soon to be 14
They say my rhymes make me sound like I'm obscene
You guys on some dirty shit and I keep it clean
This ain't a movie but my life goes by scenes
Young kid doing raps with big dreams
Latin Hustle squad yeah you know thats my team

(Verse 2):
Killer on the beat
Nike's on my feet
I'm too fucking sweat
Bitch, Trick or Treat
This my 5th song so I'm on a 5 peat
Don't fuck with the Hustle cuz up your ass is my feet
I'm to fuckin dope
Clean yo mouth with soap
Choke you with a rope
And fuckin blast the pope
Like me if you love me and hate me if you don't
You think ima stop but the homies know I won't
You see in this rap game I'm the fuckin man
People who failed were jogging
And I just fuckin ran
Lil "Alex" Ace that's the fuckin master plan
Yutziri Aeli Sanchez, that's my number 1 fan
Have you ever seen a dog wearing a muzzle?
When I'm done with this your ass is gonna need a muzzle
Bitch we hard
Like a puzzle
4 words "Big Hustle, Latin Hustle"

The bell has rung so class is in session
Fuck ima name my mixtape "1st Impression"
Rapping and hip-hop is my fuckin obsession
My rhymes make my haters go thru a big depression
Fuckin with my iPod bumping Weezy Baby
He's the fuckin shit and his rhymes are fuckin crazy
Last name ever
First name greatest
Shout out Drizzy Drake cuz he's the one who said this
Out on bail
Fresh out of jail
California dreamin
That's 2Pac, when he died all the people were screamin
I go hard on this shit look at me I'm beamin
The haters told me "Alex, just keep on dreamin"
But look at me now
Another song with no hook
I saw them turn around
