Whoa
Whoa
Whoa
Hold on

(Verse 1)

Cash rules that's old news
Dough is this what runs you
Couldn't be I'm too new
Switched up like a new hue

Dark red to bright green
Can't stop cause we coasting
On a yacht drifting closely
That Captain there just O.D

Over done his good Deeds
On some tax fee he didn't pay
Somebody came at him
They say he owned cocaine
(Hands Up)

He's over board running a shore
Misunderstood nothing more
These pirates wanting fools gold
Once gone what they fighting for
You might also like(Hook)
Hot whips, We Ain't Worried about That
Hot Chains, We Ain't Worried about That
Them Hot Girls, We Ain't Worried about That
Hot Shit, We Got That On Deck
Hot Shit, We Got That on Deck
Hot Shit, We Got That on Deck
Now guess what, Guess who's next
Guess what, Guess who's next

Hot whips, We Ain't Worried about That
Hot Chains, We Ain't Worried about That
Them Hot Girls, We Ain't Worried about That
Hot Shit, We Got That On Deck
Hot Shit, We Got That on Deck
Hot Shit, We Got That on Deck
Now guess what, Guess who's next
Guess what, Guess who's next

(Verse 2)

Hot round here where I go
Get beat more than bongo
All for that glory glow
Starving Hard, Digging Slow
Fat stomachs and ribs show
Barely know my Ken(cousin, person of relation) folk
"Imfondo" and "Oyo" (Cities in Republic of Congo, Africa)
Diamonds and Oro

The only world that we know
Though our Econ is low
All I know is poor roads
Headaches and Sorrow

Clean water would be cool
Good Food And Clothes too
A vote that counts
To count on my accounts

(Hook)

(Verse 3)

Whips and chains no thank you
Got hundreds of years of bad news
Linked up then tattooed
Oppressed given names too

No love for your home
Only for what you got on
You ain't cool slurring your tones
Being a trendy chaser Jones
She's hot, that's dope
Is she sane, who knows
Don't skate around
Then lose control

Next time you yelling brake
Will she still hang close
Or cling to a new host
Tell me how pro your game Go, Go

Hot whips, We Ain't Worried about That
Hot Chains, We Ain't Worried about That
Them Hot Girls, We Ain't Worried about That
Hot Shit, We Got That On Deck
Hot Shit, We Got That on Deck
Hot Shit, We Got That on Deck
Now guess what, Guess who's next
Guess what, Guess who's next
