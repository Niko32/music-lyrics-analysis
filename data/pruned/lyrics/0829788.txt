In a frame on a mantle in a house
Piece by piece they put their world together
Some kids a mortage and a pair of wedding vows
She's a mother and a working woman
He sweats 9 to 5 with big dreams in his head
There's too much month at the end of the money
Wolf's at the door and the bankbook's in the red
I guess every fairy tale has a monster underneath the bed

Whatever happened to the Prince and Cinderella
That wide-eyed boy and girl
What happens after happy- ever-after
Love in the real world

She leaves him notes on the refrigerator
He phones in messages to say he's working late
So hard to find a tender moment together
So many modern ways to miscommunicate
Guess every honey moon has and experation date

Whatever happened to the Prince and Cinderella
That wide-eyed boy and girl
What happens after happy- ever-after
Love in the real world

May be faded and worn
But when illusions die
True love will cary on

What ever happened to the Prince and Cinderella
That wide-eyed boy and girl
They're graduatin' from happy-ever-after
To love in the real world

What happens after happy-ever-after
Love in the real world

There's a picture of a happy couple
In a frame on a mantle in a house
