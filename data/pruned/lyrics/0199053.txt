I know
Nothing ever keeps you safe for sure
No one ever dug down so far, we'd go
When heroes dropped their bombs outside
No one ever knew I made it
No one ever

[Chorus]
Oh, bury us alive
Oh, bury us alive
Oh, bury us alive
Oh, bury us alive

[Verse 2]
Below, nothing ever grows
I'd come to see I'd froze
No one even noticed 'til I climbed and saw
The new world clouded out the sun
No one ever learned
(I see a touch of death to set me free)

[Chorus]
Oh, bury us alive
Oh, bury us alive
Oh, bury us alive
Oh, bury us aliveYou might also like
