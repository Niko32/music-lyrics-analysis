Hidden in the mountains, under the earth and stone
A cubic mile of perfection, a treasure no one has known
One man came upon this motherlode
Built himself a thousand room chateau

[Verse 2]
He's the emperor of diamonds, master of the prize
He's got a hold on happiness and all that money can buy
Everyday he lives in fascination
This is not an everyday temptation

[Chorus]
It's the diamond as big as the Ritz
What you gonna do with this?
Tell me who's gonna save you when you're a slave to
The diamond as big as the Ritz?

[Verse 3]
A blessing can become a curse if you keep it to yourself
Your own exaggeration is not so good for your health
It's the prophecy of the unattainable dream
If you take one look behind the shine, it doesn't always gleam

[Pre-Chorus]
Everyday he lives in fascination
This is not an everyday temptation
You might also like[Chorus]
It's the diamond as big as the Ritz
What you gonna do with this?
Tell me who's gonna save you when you're a slave to
The diamond as big as the Ritz?

[Bridge]
Diamond, diamond, diamond, diamond
Diamond, coal under pressure
Diamond, sparkle of treasure
Diamond, crystalline measure
Diamond, ornamental pleasure
Diamond, in the corner of your eye
Diamond, make a grown man cry
Diamond, all the seeds you've sown
Diamond

[Verse 4]
Greed can crumble castle walls, greed can purchase you thrills
Power is a dangerous thing, it can maim, it can kill
It's the prophecy of the unattainable dream
If you take one look behind the shine, it doesn't always gleam

[Chorus]
It was a diamond as big as the Ritz
What you gonna do with this?
Tell me who's gonna save you when you're a slave to
The diamond as big as the Ritz?
[Chorus]
It was the diamond as big as the Ritz
What you gonna do with this?
Tell me who's gonna save you when you're a slave to
The diamond as big as the Ritz?
