Fit panis hominum;
Dat panis coelicus
Figures terminum;
O res mirabilis!
Manducat Dominum
Pauper, pauper
Servus et humilis

Translation:
The bread of heaven
Is made the bread of men;
The bread of heaven
Puts an end to all symbols
What a wonder!
A poor man partakes of the Lord
A poor
And humble servantYou might also like
