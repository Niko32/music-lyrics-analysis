Down in Mexico
Once every year
The girls and I go
Pack up our bags
For sun and good cheer
Share a lot laughs
And a couple of beers & tears
Point our compass
South of the snow
And go to Zihuatanejo

Chorus:
Oh, Oh, Zihuatanejo
For a dollar or two we'll share what's new
With our old friend Jose Cuervo
Oh, Oh, Zihuatanejo
Feel the sun on my face and sand in my toes
Down in Mexico
You see smilin' faces most everywhere
There's a joi-de-vivre in the air
Mariachi bands are playin' in the street
You can feel the rhythm, dance to beat, it's so sweet
Point our compass south of the snow
And go to Zihuatanejo

Oh, Oh, Zihuatanejo
For a dollar or two we'll share what's new
With our old friend Jose Cuervo
Oh, Oh, Zihuatanejo
Feel the sun on my face and sand in my toes
Down in Mexico
Watch the waves roll in and the sun go down
And the world pass by, in that little town
Oh, Oh, Zihuat, Zihuatanejo
Oh, Oh, eye-yey-yey-yey-yey-yey-yey-yo-ho
Oh, Oh, Zihuat, Zihuatanejo
