And they be like, "Damn, why Jay Rahh so cold?"
Little nigga, always spilling 40's on hoes
Dress like NY, but he on 24's
Slugs in his mouth, teeth rot cause the gold
I don't fuck with you niggas cause all y'all look feeble
Don't wanna learn, well that semi gone teach you
Left his body and his brains on the road
Hold up, cock back, and it blow
I'm the most high, Allah, Your bitch, she idolize me
I'm ready to die, like Biggie. I'm strapped up, that's kamikaze
You niggas ready to eat? I serve it to them wasabi
And if you didn't have me, then where the fuck would your God be?
Bitch ass nigga, oh you mad cause you can't top me
Bitch nigga mad, cause his girl want to top me
I seen her in the lobby
She giving me sloppy
The back of her throat and she said it was throbbing

[Chorus]
Uh, respect me
On my chest, where the "S" be
On my side where tech be
You talk shit, you next, B
Uh,  respect me
On my chest, where the "S" be
On my side where tech be
That's Jay Rahh, dont test me
You might also like[Verse 2]
Hidden forever
Lighting that dro
And I'm all in your girl, see how far she can go
And she doing the most, when she slide up the pole
And she drop it back down do a split on the floor
Moving so slow
Must be that lean
Purple or pink, it don't matter to me
Dirty sprite, purple weed, MDMA or LSD
Worth a couple milla, know I keep it trilla
And that girl with that ass can get the D in
Flippin' the whip , pimpin' your trick
Sucking up all of my kids
Pulled over for 10-56
She grabbed that molly, put in her panties quick
She know the routine, cause that's my chick
Pulled out the curb, and hit the lick

[Chorus]
