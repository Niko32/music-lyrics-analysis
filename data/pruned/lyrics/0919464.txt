I go to work from 10:30 until 6 a.m
Raking up the dimes and quarters, slinging eggs and ham
Scrambled, poached or over easy, coffee black and strong
Jukebox of scratchy records, I play 'em all night long

[Chorus]
Eternal blue neon
We're never closed
When the world is asleep, darling, come take a seat
You can always eat at Joe's (Eat at Joe's)

[Verse 2]
Here comes old Frank Taylor, smelling like old gin
Guess his wife couldn't get him sober, it's up to me again
Here's a hot top on your coffee, honey, you're a mess
I ain't your wife, I ain't your mama, but I'll do, I guess

[Chorus]
Eternal blue neon
We're never closed
When the world is asleep, darling, come take a seat
You can always eat at Joe's (Eat at Joe's)

[Bridge]
Hello, Prince Charming, where are you, dear?
When will you come in and order biscuits here?
You might also like[Verse 3]
Truck drivers, musicians with no place to go
I can be your domestic goddess for an hour or so

[Chorus]
Eternal blue neon
We're never closed
When the world is asleep, darling, come take a seat
You can always eat at Joe's (Eat at Joe's)

[Outro]
Go to work at
Black coffee strong (Eat at Joe's)
Order's up
