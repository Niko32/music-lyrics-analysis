The pitch black night when he was slayed
His house burnt to the ground
A sea of flames is where he drowned

Now he has awoken
Rituals of the dead
Revenge is in his veins and must be fed
Come back from the dead

He crawls up from the mud
His vengeance seeking human blood
He rises from his grave
A rotten hunter seeks his prey

Lurking in the shadows
Axe ready to shred
Victims screaming out in fervent dread
Come back from the dead

Walking through the graveyard
A figure wrapped in black
Psychotic creature waiting to attack
Come back from the deadYou might also like
