I was a just a kid, I've no idea
Why I did the things I did
If I have one regret it's her
Though I pretend that I don't care

You don't love her
The way I love you
You don't love her the way I do
When I saw her
I forgot the years

All those pointless
Arguments and tears
And as far as I can see
You've been worse for her than me

You don't love her
The way I love you
You don't love her the way I do

You don't love her
The way I love you
You don't love her, she loves you

I did the things I chose to do
My plans did not include her too
I'm back in town, I just got free
You're standing there instead of me
You might also likeYou don't love her
The way I love you
You don't love her the way I do
You don't love her

The way I love you
You don't love her, she loves you
You don't love her
The way I love you

You don't love her the way I do
You don't love her
The way I love you
You don't love her, she loves you
