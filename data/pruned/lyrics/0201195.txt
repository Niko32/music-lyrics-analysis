In the mornin'
It's all right
I'm not giving up
Just gonna try
I got a lifetime
To keep on living man
The way you do it
Is to get right to it
Sometime I think before our life is gone
We'll see the kingdom come

[Verse 1: Prometheus Brown]
From Salt Lake
To the world
Ey
A gunner and a scholar and an Aliamanu hustler,
Walk into a bar and never pay a cover
Order me a Jame' on the rock
Every city got one
Now I'm feeling fucked up
See us in the media portrayed as some suckers
Make me wanna shoot the television up
Duck Hunt
On my fifth trip to in the island in a three year span
Doing everything I've listed on my three year plan
Me and Bam see ya plans
We demand people stand
Be a good, be a bad
Be a women, be a man
Be it
But let it be
Me?
I let it breathe
Forever in the 6
My Evergreen fix
Stay fulfilled
Still chillin'
They say God willing
Like God's got feelings and he don't like villains
But if God be the Father and all of us his children
Than the Earth is a single Mother on assisted living
Yeah, I'm feeling great
You can feel if you relate
On the H-1, blazed up, peelin' through the 8
With the palm trees wavin' at me I say
HI
Live from Hawai`i
Still the same guy, ah!

[Verse 2: Bambu]
Mahalo from the hardest acts to follow
Pro Brown and Buck phenomenal
We're the live show
Brotha's chuggin' Henn like there's a dollar in the bottle
And put dirt inside their bodies like GMOs in McDonald's meals
I'm tryin' to rework our families
Thousands follow my Twitter
Can't get turned into a rally
That's some sad shit
Take it back to ground work
And devils interfere progress so let us bang first
I rock Dodger blue
But hate the boys in blue
We roll up joints and shoot liquor
So we poison proof
All my Viet's in New Orleans in at a stand still
They turned Versailles into a mother fucking landfill
So fuck it
Me and G stay mad
Meth and into method
Walt and Gus
We break bad
Two dads who understand how to plan and revamp
Our plan when the plan don't pan out
Pan handle hand out
Homeless man hangout
Living on the beach, looking back
At a million dollar HI house
Wondering how he called a native to an island
But got no home?
Honolulu, haoles out here buying in
Huh?
In4mants all day
And fuck Dog the Hunter
Hash tag, I'm just sayin'
[Osna]
Whatchu sayin'?
You don't like Dog?
I thought you Filipino uh?

[Bambu]
Ey yo Osna, stop playin'
