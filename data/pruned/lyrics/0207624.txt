Don't look at me with love in your eyes
Go look at somebody that can make it worthwhile
I'm hurting from a love affair I didn't want to end
And I'm in no condition to try to love again

[Verse 2]
Don't smile at me because it's no use
'Cause I don't have a smile that I can give to you
Someday you might look me up, but let me be 'til then
For I'm in no condition to try to love again

[Chorus]
I'm in no condition to try to love again
The man I love just broke my heart and it must have time to mend
He have me the breeze, now he's gone with the wind
And I'm in no condition to try to love again

[Chorus]
I'm in no condition to try to love again
The man I love just broke my heart and it must have time to mend
He have me the breeze, now he's gone with the wind
And I'm in no condition to try to love again

[Refrain]
I'm in no condition to try to love againYou might also like
