The scent of my hands is familiar
To fosterly men in their coats
Who guide with their spirits from fire, fire, fire, fire
Who speak with some tenderly
Who speak with some tenderly coax
The tinge of my eyes was familiar
To fosterly men in their coats
Who get close, close, close to their closetly homes
And illuminate the world of the ghosts

[Pre-Chorus]
Ears ring and teeth click and
Ears ring and teeth click and
Ears, ears, ears ring and teeth click and
Ears ring and teeth click and
Ears ring and teeth click and
Ears ring and teeth click and ears, ears ring

[Chorus]
The air is familiar the sound is not still
Dead voices cover their moats
They fill their cloth totes with rustles of the earth
And the cry of detritioning bones

[Verse 2]
The dust off my knuckles familiar
To culminated piles, to culminated piles of bones
That shift when the earth quakes and trembles
And quarries men up to their, and quarries men up to their thrones
The scent of my skin is familiar
To fosterly men in their coats
Who guide with their spirits from fire, fire, fire, fire
Who speak with some tenderly
Who speak with some tenderly coax
You might also like[Chorus]
The air is familiar the sound is not still
Dead voices cover their moats
They fill their cloth totes with rustles of the earth
And the ladies that they have ungirthed

[Outro]
Ears ring and teeth click and
Ears ring and teeth click and
Ears ring and teeth click and
Ears ring and teeth click and ears, ears ring
