I've seen everything

Soothe your fear, we're off where it's warmer
Here's to all of us, I know you are worried
We're leaving here, regret to inform you
Leaving everything, it's just that we've got to
Believe in everything, we're leaving everything

It was all a big mistake
It was all a big mistake
It was all a big mistake

And I've seen everything, I've seen everything
The last three cheers, we're shaking the bottle
Pull the cork on us, there is no tomorrow
No yesterday and we won't be sorry
We knew all along that we'd never matter
We're leaving here, regret to inform
But soothe your fear, we're off where it's warm
And I've seen everything, I've seen everything

It was all a big mistake
It was all a big mistake
It was all a big mistake
Soothe your fear, we're off where it's warm
