Baby, please stop messing around
You're messing around all the time
Baby, please stop messing around
You're messing around all the time
Now, if you don't stop messing around
You'll be somebody's baby, instead of mine, yeah

[Verse 2]
I want you to squeeze-a me, baby, until my face turns cherry red
You roll me so hard, baby, I'm falling out of bed now
Please stop messing around, messing around all the time
Now, if you don't stop messing around
Be somebody's baby, instead of mineYou might also like
