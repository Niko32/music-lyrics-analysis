Of trying to break free from this sadness that I can't lay to rest
This old honky-tonk sure does feel like home
And the music with the laughter seem to soothe my loneliness

Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From the memory that's driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me forget her, so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose

If a tear should fall, if I should whisper her name
To some stranger I'm holdin' while we're dancin' to an old Buck Owens song
I know she won't mind, she won't even know
She'll be dancing with a memory crying teardrops of her own

Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From the memory that's driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me forget her so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose

Turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
From the memory that's driving me lonely, crazy and blue
It helps me forget her so the louder the better
Hey mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me loose
Yeah, mister turn it on, turn it up, turn me looseYou might also like
