Mama always told me i was a fighter and nothing could keep me down
She said never say never and I always knew better than to keep both feet on the ground
I'm just one step behind reaching cloud number 9 and gravity's got nothing on me
A girl's gotta dream and you'd better believe the lights are gonna shine on me

[Chorus]
Those thoughts of broadway and lights around my name on the marquee
Keep me flying and trying to be the best this town has ever seen
I don't know how to get there, but I'll get there just watch me
Live the dream

[Verse 2]
When I was a bit younger somebody told me, girl you're wasting your time
They said no one ever makes it in country music (show business) and they're gonna eat you alive
I stood forcing a smile for a little while and left him with a wink
Cause I know one day he'll see my face on the cover of a magazine

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
I wanna hear the crowds singing my songs back to me
I wanna play music every day and give another girl a dream
I wanna show the world you can be what you want to be
