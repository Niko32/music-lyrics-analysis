This Track Is Called Should Have Been There For You

Check

[Verse 1]

Did I Take You For Granted?
Was It Really Love That I Ever Wanted?
Did I Ever Treat You More Like A Lady?
Were We Growing Or Jus' Too Steady?

Did We Felt So Prime?
Did I Ever Gave You The Quality Time?
Was I Ever So Mean To You?
Why Did You Think That I Was Cheating On You?
You might also likeWere You An Angel Or Jus' Too Holy?
Is It Too Late To Say Sorry?
Were You A Good Girl Falling For A Bad Guy?
LOVE IS BLIND BUT I SAW YOU WITH MY LEFT EYE!

These Questions Are Running Into My Head
And When I Answer, I Try Not To Feel Bad
Cause There's One Thing That I Didn't Do
And It Was Not Being There For You

[Chorus]

I Should Have Been There For You
I Should Have Been There For You
I Should Have Been There For You
I'm Sorry I Wasn't There For You. X2


[Verse 2]

I Should Have Met You Half Way
Jus' Like You Did To Me Everyday
I Know You Cared For Me, No Doubt
Cause You Were Always There When I Was Stressed Out

But You Told Me I Was Boring, It Hurts But Hey You Were Honest
Then You Told Me I Was Childish, Metaphorically But Still You Were Honest
If I Could Tell You How I Really Feel, It Would Be More Painful Than It Ever Was
But I Gotta Keep Quiet Till The Wound Heal And I Think I'm A Better Person Than I Ever Was

I Know You Moved On, Thats What I Admire
Cause I Couldn't Be Your Hero, I Was Just A Flyer
I Don't Know If I Believed In Me And You
All I Know Is That, I Wasn't There For You

[Chorus]

I Should Have Been There For You
I Should Have Been There For You
I Should Have Been There For You
I'm Sorry I Wasn't There For You. X2

[Verse 3]

I Know You Felt So Miserable
Due To Those Fights, Some Unavoidable
I Know You Thought That I Didn't Care
But I Did, Even Though I Wasn't There

All I Wanted Was To See You Happy
Feeling Loved, Cherished Like A Baby
But I Never Had A Plan For That
All I Did Was To Bore You I'm Sorry For That
I Know We History But The Past Is Kicking Forward
We Never Kissed, Maybe I Was Just A Coward
I Am So Sorry For Every Pain I've Put You Through
I Know We Ain't Friends But I Keep On Missing You

I'm Sorry For My Sexual Obsession
I Was A Jerk To Keep Up With Competition
I know I've Played Mind Games To You
And I'm Sorry That I Wasn't There For You

[Chorus]

I Should Have Been There For You
I Should Have Been There For You
I Should Have Been There For You
I'm Sorry I Wasn't There For You. X2


[Outro]

Dear Pruddie

I Know That I Wasted Time For Not Being There For You And Lost You To Somebody Else

But I Want You To Know, Thats The Only Thing I Regret About My Past : Not Being There For You
