Pickin' these old time songs
No matter how far I get from here
This place still feels like home

Remember all those summer nights
We'd talk about life and such
Well Dad, I've come to realize
I haven't said enough

But thanks for the G chord
Teachin' me about the good Lord
Givin' me that old Ford
When I turned sixteen

Thanks for hangin' in there
When I was goin' nowhere
Thanks for never changin'
That lock on the front door
Thanks for the G chord

That old flat top Martin, you gave me back then
You know I've still got it now
I keep it locked up in that same ol' case
You used to tote around
You might also likeSometimes when the crowd is quiet
I'll bring it out again
And play the first song you taught me
Back when I was ten

Thanks for the G chord
Teachin' me about the good Lord
Givin' me that old Ford
When I turned sixteen

Thanks for hangin' in there
When I was goin' nowhere
Thanks for never changin'
That lock on the front door
Thanks for the G chord

Thanks for hangin' in there
When I was goin' nowhere
Thanks for never changin'
That lock on the front door
Thanks for the G chord
