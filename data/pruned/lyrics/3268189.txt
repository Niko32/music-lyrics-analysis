[Chorus]
When you fall in love, ah
When you fall in love
When you fall in love, ah
When you fall in love, yeah

[Verse 1]
How can I defend how good it is to define
When you call it a day (Ah)
Before you've given it any of your time
A crossroad is better than a crossfire
Better than a crossfire
A crossroad is better

[Chorus]
When you fall in love, ah
When you fall in love
When you fall in love
When you fall in love, yeah

[Verse 2]
How can I begin if you shootin' it down
When you want my love
But you don't wanna give any of yours up, up
A crossroad is better than a crossfire, oh-oh
Fire, fire, fire
How to keep up? Will it turn to bitter use?
How do I give love, when it's serving only you?
Oh, a crossroad is better than a crossfire
Better than a crossfire, uh
A crossroad is better than a crossfire, fire
Better than a crossfire

When you fall in l-l-l-l-love (Ah)
