Dawn is a feeling, a beautiful ceiling
The smell of grass just makes you pass into a dream
You're here today, no future fears
This day will last a thousand years
If you want it to

[Verse 2: Justin Hayward]
You look around you, things they astound you
So breathe in deep, you're not asleep, open your mind
You're here today, no future fears
This day will last a thousand years
If you want it to

[Bridge: Mike Pinder]
Do you understand
That all over this land
There's a feeling?
In minds far and near
Things are becoming clear
With a meaning

[Verse 3: Justin Hayward]
Now that you're knowing, pleasure starts flowing
It's true, life flies faster than eyes could ever see
You're here today, no future fears
This day will last a thousand years
If you want it toYou might also like
