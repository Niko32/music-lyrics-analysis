I opened my eyes, look at the clock
It says eight fifteen
Stumble out of bed, fumble down the hall
Still half asleep
Opened up a window, opened up the paper
And put some coffee on, grab two cups
Oh yeah, you're gone

[Verse 2]
Shower and shave, take a little time to read the news
Sort through the mail
See something about some sale they're having on women's shoes
Billy's band is playing at the Canyon club on Friday
I bet they sing our song, maybe we can go
Oh year, you're gone

[Chorus]
This is going to take some getting used to baby
I'm going to need more time
Cause I still say us when I ought to say me
I still say ours instead of mine
Every plan I make, every road I take
I still see you riding along
Then suddenly it hits me
Oh yeah, you're gone
You might also like[Chorus]
This is going to take some getting used to baby
I think I need more time
Because I still say us, when I ought to say me
I still say ours instead of mine
Every plan I make, every road I take
I still see you riding alone
Then suddenly it hits me
Oh yeah, you're gone

[Outro]
Oh there ain't no doubt about it baby
Oh yeah, you're gone
