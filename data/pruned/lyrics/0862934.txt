I've worked here for two years
That old man lives in here
Drinks all night and peels off all the labels
I sit back and watch him go
As he lines them up all in a row
Side by side, he sits them at his table

[Pre-Chorus]
I bet he's memorized those words printed on the side
God knows that man has read those lines a thousand times
Imagine what he'd know if the bottle was a bible

[Chorus]
I bet he's drank the river Jordan
The flesh is weaker than what they're pourin'
And right there in that bar, he'd have revival
If the bottle was a bible

[Verse 2]
He'd hold the answers in his hand
Be a prophet to the drinkin' man
In a haze of neon lights and tortured souls
But for him, it's gin and misery
Dyin' in her lovin' memory
Since he laid her in that field of granite stone
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Tempting fruit is best left on the vine
Cause he'd probably turn the water into wine

[Chorus]
I bet he's drank the river Jordan
The flesh is weaker than what they're pourin'
And right there in that bar, he'd have revival
If the bottle was a bible

[Chorus]
I bet he's drank the river Jordan
The flesh is weaker than what they're pourin'
And right there in that bar, he'd have revival
If the bottle was a bible
Yeah, right there in that bar, he'd have revival
If the bottle was a bible
