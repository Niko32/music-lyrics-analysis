Oh, nobody knows but you
How to make me come alive
And oh, my heart explodes
Kaboom, like rockets in the sky

[Verse 1]
Are you some kind of mind reader?
'Cause you know all the things to say
You brighten up my darkest days, days yeah
I'm not afraid to say that I need ya
And I know it sounds insane
But boy, I never felt this way, way yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Three, two, one, look where we are
Got me launching to the stars
Woah, let's go

[Chorus]
Oh, nobody knows but you
How to make me come alive
And oh, my heart explodes
Kaboom, like rockets in the sky

[Verse 2]
Hit me like a crash of thunder
Yeah, you knocked me off my feet
And promised that you'll never leave, leave yeah
This must be a spell I'm under
'Cause if I'm dreamin', let me sleep
'Cause I don't ever want to break free, no
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Three, two, one, look where we are
Got me launching to the stars
Woah, let's go

[Chorus]
Oh, nobody knows but you
How to make me come alive
And oh, my heart explodes
Kaboom, like rockets in the sky

[Bridge]
Like rockets, can't stop this
Our love is hotter than flames
We're shootin' out of this place, yeah
Like rockets, we got this
And I know it won't ever change
'Cause we're shootin' out of this place, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, nobody knows but you
How to make me come alive
And oh, my heart explodes
Kaboom, like rockets in the sky

[Outro]
Boy, are you some kind of mind reader?
Not afraid to say that I need ya, no, no, no, no, no, no
You hit me like a crash of thunder
This must be a spell that I'm under
Like rockets in the sky
Like rockets in the sky, no, yeah
