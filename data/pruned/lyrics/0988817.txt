Baby I'm your man
I'm the back you lean on when you need a friend
Now I see that I'm
Blackened by a lie
It's just imagination I'll tell you why
When you call on the phone
Late at night no-one's home
Ain't enough to justify
Your boyfriend's got a creepin' eye

Baby don't believe the trash they tell you
Cause I could make a story like that
And now who would you believe
Your friends or me now baby
Don't believe the trash
Baby don't believe the trash they tell you
Cause I would never play it like that
And I'm hoping you decide that girl I'm right now baby
Don't believe the trash

So many reasons why
You should know that I'd
Never go behind you and make you cry
Don't you throw this man
Who gives you all he can
Just because your friends trash trust in a man
