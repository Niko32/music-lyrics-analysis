Lead on your crucifying me
Dream of your great escape
Keep on electrifying me
Fire on and break away

[Verse 2]
Plan on your sacrificing me
Scan on the breathes I take
Keep on electrifying me
Fire on and break away

[Pre-Chorus]
There's no waking up from you

[Chorus]
Forever, drift away with me
Surrender to the heartbeat
This murder lingers over me
Could you ever kill to break free?

[Verse 3]
Fear on my dominating Thee
Clear on your mind and pray
Hear on your inner hating me
Fight on and run away
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
There's no waking up from you

[Chorus]
Forever, drift away with me
Surrender to the heartbeat
This murder lingers over me
Could you ever kill to break free?

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
More than a thrill, more than unreal
More than a dream you are inside me
More than I dare, more than I share
More than I bear it's you who trapped me

[Chorus]
Forever, drift away with me
Surrender to the heartbeat
This murder lingers over me
Could you ever kill to break free?
Forever, drift away with me
Surrender to the heartbeat
This murder lingers over me
Could you ever kill to break free?
