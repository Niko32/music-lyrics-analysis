A warming fire - on the shore
Holding hands - at the seaside
Riding horses - in the dunes

Seagulls calling - waves are tumbling
Until dawn - till the sun will rise
We're swimming out - to horizon
Watching the clouds - hanging over us

Our love is dynamite

Bathing in the sun - send a smile
Watching the greens - the bees in love
The mist at dawn - flowers covered
So come along - we start a romance

Our love is dynamite

Making love - without cover
People passing - the world's our friend
Children laughing - all is happy
Say hello - to eternity
