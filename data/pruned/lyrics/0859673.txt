Someone to call me their own
How I wish I had someone to live with
'Cause I'm tired of livin' alone
Please meet me tonight in the moonlight
Please meet me tonight alone
For I have a sad story to tell you
It's a story that's never been told
Oh, if I had wings like an angel
Through the heavenly sky high I would fly
I'd fly to the arms of my darlin'
And there I'd be willing to dieYou might also like
