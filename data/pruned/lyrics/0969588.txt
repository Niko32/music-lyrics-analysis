All I need is you
All I need is you, baby
All I need is you
All I want is you

[Verse 1]
Stay with me through the night
Let me hold you close 'til morning light
Lay your head on my heart
Make love to me while it's still dark

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no one but you
Could make me feel the way you do
You're all that I've been praying for
'Cause the way you're loving me
I couldn't ask for anymore

[Chorus]
All I need is you
See, you're everything that I never had
And baby, all I need is you
See, you're everything that I need so bad

[Verse 2]
I been in love once or twice
But I never found the love that's right
Until you came along (Just like a bird)
I was like a bird without a song
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, no one but you
Could make me feel the way you do
You're all that I, I've been praying for
See 'cause the way you're loving me
I couldn't ask for anymore

[Chorus]
All I need is you
See, you're everything, everything that I never had, never had
And all I need is you, you're everything
Everything that I needed so bad, baby, oh

[Bridge]
(All I need, all I want is you)
You've been so sweet to me
(All I need, all I want is you, baby)
And there's nothing in the world that I wouldn't do
(All I need, all I want is you)
All I need is you
I can climb any mountain, I can swim any sea
(All I need, all I want is you, baby)
Just as long as you stay here with me
(All I need, all I want is you)
You see, you're everything
That a man could ever hope for, yeah
(All I need, all I want is you)
It's you, it's you, it's you, it's you, it's you
[Outro]
Baby, all I need is you
You're everything I need so bad
Baby, it's you, it's you
Yes, all I need is you
Good God almighty, you're everything
You're everything that I never had
I been looking for and never found it
It's you, baby
