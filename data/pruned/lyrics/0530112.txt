Just another weekend I don't wanna go out
Maybe we could stay in, play a little Soul Child
I wanna set the mood right, flowing like the river Nile
Ooh darling, I wanna see your heart smile

Ooh darling, I wanna see your heart smile
Ooh darling, I wanna see your heart smile
Ooh darling, I wanna see your heart smile
Ooh darling, I wanna see your heart smile

(Verse 1)
I wish I had the power to read everything on your mind
What do you think about packing our bags, getting away some time
Somewhere with a beach and palm trees to watch the waves unwind
Talk about future plans, how we wanna live our lives
Getting to know all your likes and dislikes
I hope it isn’t hard to see that I’m tryna be your type
I hope it isn’t hard to see that I’m tryna be your type

(Chorus)
Just another weekend I don't wanna go out
Maybe we could stay in, play a little Soul Child
I wanna set the mood right, flowing like the river Nile
Ooh darling, I wanna see your heart smile
You might also likeOoh darling, I wanna see your heart smile
Ooh darling, I wanna see your heart smile
Ooh darling, I wanna see your heart smile
Ooh darling, I wanna see your heart smile

(Outro)
I wanna see you smile
The way I love that smile
Girl I wanna see you smiling for me
I wanna see you smile
The way I love that smile
I wanna see you smiling for me
