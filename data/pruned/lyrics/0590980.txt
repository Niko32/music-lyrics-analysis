Just me and you and the man on the moon
Cruisin' down some old back road

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, baby, don't you look at me that way
'Cause you know there's only so much I can take
'Cause you make me wanna

[Chorus]
Pull this truck to the side of the road
Slide on over, let me hold you close
And tell you everything I'm thinkin'
Hop on out and let the tailgate fall
Get drunk on you with no alcohol
If you don't stop, I'm gonna
Girl, you make me wanna

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, mm-hmm

Know just how to turn me on
