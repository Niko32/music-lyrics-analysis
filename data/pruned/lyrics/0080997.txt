(Demi Lovato)
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper

Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper

(Verse 1)
Yeah we fuckin' yeah we somethin'
All these haters always frontin'
Nothing to something, I keep rising
I'm always stuntin'
Advisin' they told me nothin'
Surprises she always bluffin'
The cheating and all the lyin'
Inside I feel like dyin'
I'm tired of always tryin'
You tired of all the cryin'
Surrounded by all this bullshit
The fate it got the dueces
We lost the dos Confucius
And cupid was such a nuisance
I'm stupid with all confusion
The memories, just an illusion
We backtrack and rewind, we fuck then it's fine
In due time we will shine, we got this it's our time
In my mind it's us two
You told me to trust you
In three words, "I love you"
But now it's just, "fuck you"

(Verse 2)
One sip was a mess, so it's a "fuck you" to my ex
You think I really care, about your boyfriend and your hair
You fell of like nare, the throne is my chair
These girls stop and stare, I keep choking, no air
My face turns all blue so she suck and we screw
In my dreams, it ain't true
I wake up and we through
I thought we were two, be together like glue
See forever, oh shoot
However, we lose, when our hearts all we choose
These remarks turn to cues
The ember burns out all these sparks caught the blues
Then December comes down and you still got no ?(Jew)
But your boyfriend looks like something I saw in a shoe
Remember this life is something that you knew
