I'm on the outside, looking in
I don't mind at all, cause I know where I am
All this time I waited for you, we don't gotta wait no more
All you gotta do is let me reach you anywhere you are, yeah

[Chorus: Bright Lights]
Let me be your home
Wherever you go, wherever you go, yeah
Let me be your home
A hundred million miles away, you know
I'd fly right up to Mars, I'm on the ocean floor
I'm running circles round the world for you
So let me be your home
Wherever you go, wherever you go, I'll be your home
