This your boy Soulja Boy tell'em
This girl says she got a donk
She's about to make her hips swing all night long
O na na O na na O na na O na na

[Chorus: Savage]
Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Oh shit, shake that ass ma, move it like a gypsy
Stop, woah, back it up, now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it looooow and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING
Now drop it looooow and let me see your hips SWING
Down to the floooor now let me see your hips SWING

[Verse 1: Savage]
Uh oh, lean back, girl you got some mean racks
You got a mean ass and I really mean that
But can't you see, that I need a girl, that can move
Make her hips SWING - and - look - just like you
But come to think about it, I think this club is crowded
It's kinda hard to do your thing when everyone's surrounding
So let me form a circle everybody step back
I heard somebody yell "Savage where the chorus at?!"
