Battle of tours back in 732
Founding of Islam, 622
If there was another plague what would you do
Do, Bubonic 1349. Don't ask me how, the better question is why
Why it has an affect even today
1095 First Crusade

At this point in the song, I've gotta dig hard
And I'm really strugglin' here cause' my rhyme skills ain't severe

Mansa Musa was a very rich man
He took a trip to Mecca with gold in hand
Gold on camels, gold on slaves
You could get some too just behave
Marco and Ibn were adventurous guys
One in 1294 the other in 1349

The Roman Catholic Church was a very strong group
Their leader today is known as the pope
The Orthodox Christians just couldn't cope
Cope with the corruption of the church
The Orthodox's said we won't miss 'em
1054 Great Schsim
A powerful group of nomads called Mongols sacked the capital; Baghdad

The Byzantines took another good hit
Shouts out to Manzikert, they shoulda' quit
You could say the Turks, 1071

The Ottomans were another powerful group
There were not ones to be left in a coop
The Ottomans today are known as the turks
This means that they were Islamic
The Europeans just didn't want it
The only prollem' was they couldn't do much about it
When the Europeans threatened, Ottomans said doubt it

At about the same time there was a man named Zheng He
Took a voyage too
Probably out to sea;
Many things is Thanks to He
