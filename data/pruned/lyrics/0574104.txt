Keys sound like they was played on Mastodon tusk
Green leaves give heed, the astronaut jumps
Tighten up like calfs in seven inch pumps
Loosen up and laugh, there's no need to be pompous
Just follow your nose, there's no need to be complex
Cypher seems completed there's no need for a compass
Lone Wolf, Will Ferrell, there's no need for accomplices
But since the fam is here we get it popping
Runnin' E on tree, don't worry 'cause I'm copping
Number one rule, don't ever let the cops in
We be so cool, they be like "Who let the jocks in?"
It's a sweep, swiffer, yo F it, bring the mops it
Bust hot shit with the same effort that you chop when
She said "Quelle, you it's a pleasure that you dropped in
I'm a big fan and love everything you rocking"
I said "I love you too and I'm honored that you're watching... me"

[Hook]
I'm honored that you're watching me [4x]

[Zeroh: Verse 2]
Mad had a captain mast and generally privately
No alabaster pillars that parallel the immortal soul
Ain't got to wait but to meditate ain't affordable
Just hijack a mindstate and wait and see where the portals go
I'm sort of sure for chaotic plot assorted more
Record [?], I could pull it out the last resort
On fourth to pour a quart of Morgan and Coke and more
Local coalition and compose mostly of misquotable vocal chords
Crackle, like a ten-engine minute entropy
Melenated waves and shapes raping, its men can eat
Might as well kick with, wicked entities
No enemies, goddamn I smell like a dispensary
Buzz from the buds on how the bass blares a great snare
Who cares if it's generic, you could save a little more
You know that bullshit is like the real thing
My nigga doesn't show, gusto no, fucks ratio is woah

[Verse 3: Jonwayne]
Sitting on the Earth like a throne but feeling homesick
I know I don't belong to such a place that eats the young
So I look into the blue, in hopes that I could have a part
In the clothes that I call home and the dome that's full of scars
But if I was on Neptune looking at the Earth
I'd feel the same as when I speak in foreign tongues and play the part
Always looking for the science, never see the art
But if you listen to me in between the ticks it's from the heart
I don't really know if I can ever feel again
They were pricking me with pins to see if I could really sin
Because what is sinning but a compramise to bigger carpe diem
For the minds try to make us feel that we could really dim
I'm a light, what is light to us is dark to them
That's why I never trip I'm just glad they let me use a pen
Now really though, I don't need the dictation
But I'm glad you chose to tune in to my station
