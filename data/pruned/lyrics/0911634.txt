What up Ri¢h? I know it's been tough paying your shit
Kicked out of school, bout to lose your crib
Please don't tell me you gon sell again
I don't wanna see you end up inside a cell my friend
For the love of god, go get a job, they even raised the minimum wage, now it's the law
I mean you know what it's like when times get hard
Like when you got kicked out, slept under trees at the park
But do what you must
For you, there's no getting through
Trust in your lies even when you know the fucking truth
Thinking "I'll start tomorrow afternoon"
But tomorrow never comes
It's the same day for you
On the couch back
Sitting on your lazy ass
Smoke in the air from all that hazy grass
But that ain't the only green you're gonna need
We do anything for it, fiendish for some cash
Huh

[Verse 2]
Chasing the American Dream, it's iconic
Funny how my name is Ri¢h, it's ironic
When I'm at bottom of the class in socioeconomics
Can't have a bitch blow through rings faster than Super Sonic
Like why all my friends been tryna get booed up
While my soul search has solely been for Buddha
Mary always had my back, no tripping
Except of course whenever our lips get to kissing
Like fuck love
I'm a fuck up
Getting fucked up
But no disrespect to all my friends who got lucked up
All I mean is that shit just ain't for me
Ain't no hippy man but I love and hug the tree
Like it's the 70s
Love is all you need
Let us all be free
And just let it be
All I want is good vibez all surrounding me
And spread em all around like a sneeze in the breeze
Man this sound amazing
History in the making
Now that I'm the topic of all the conversations
I'd like to shout out on the radio stations, good vibrationz nation
Exclamation!
Y'all never expected this from that quiet emo kid
Y'all never really knew me so ima talk my shit
Neff sweatshirts and Lakai kicks
Skating stairsets and trying flip tricks
Man back then those days were so sick
And I'll bring it back with the rhymes that I spit
Inspired by Nas and Illmatic
And I'll say this, straight platonic

One love, one love
One love, one love
One love, one love
One love, one love

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I sit back
With a Buddha sack
Tryna find my head
And where my life's at
And if I took a wrong turn
Where was the sign at?
And if you tryna buy my soul
Where do I sign at?
Cuz I'm not sure what's my price tag
Not too sure a church could divine that
Think I lost my train of thought again but never mind that
Mary got me tripping again, brought my high back
Always been about Good Vibez, shout out my man LAC
He had a Vision on his Road, no matter how cracked
And I got a story of my own
No matter how whack
Cuz my friend, in the very end, it's always only ever been about one what? One love

[Hook]
One love, one love
One love, one love
One love, one love
One love, one love
One love, one love
One love, one love
One love, one love
One love, one love
