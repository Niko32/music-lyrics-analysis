I was a stranger passing through your town
When I asked you a favor
Good gal you turned me down

You may see me out a walking
Talking down that railroad track
You may see me out a walking
Talking down that railroad track
But good gal you done me wrong
I ain't never coming back

(Break: fiddle)

I've rode that old Southern, I've rode that L&N
I've rode that old Southern, I've rode that L&N
And if the police don't get me
I'm gonna ride them again

(Break: guitar)

Some like Chicago, some love Memphis, Tennessee
Some like Chicago, some love Memphis, Tennessee
Hey pretty mama, give me sweet Dallas Texas
Where the women think the world of me
You might also like(Break: guitar)

I'm not singing the blues, I'm just telling you the hard luck I've had
I'm not singing blues, I'm just telling you the hard luck I've had
'Cause the blues ain't nothing
But a good man feeling bad
