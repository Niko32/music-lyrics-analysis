It would be wrong to ask you why
Because I know what goes inside
Is only half of what comes out
Isn't that what it's about?
It's about
To remind us we're alive
To remind us we're not blind
In that big black hole

[Pre-Chorus]
Comfortable
Digging the grave, I got it made

[Chorus]
Let something in, throw something out
You left the door open wide

[Verse 2]
I know you have a reason why
That knot is better left untied
I just went and undid mine
It takes some time
And the shadows so big
It takes the sun out of the day
And the feeling goes away
When you close the door
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Comfortable
Digging the grave, I got it made

[Chorus]
Let something in, throw something out
You left the door open wide

[Post-Chorus]
Digging the grave, I got it made

[Instrumental Break]

[Interlude]
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

[Pre-Chorus]
Comfortable
Digging the grave, I got it made

[Chorus]
Let something in, throw something out
You left the door open wide
[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
And it's out of this world, comfortable!
Out of this world, comfortable!
Out of this world, comfortable!
Out of this world, comfortable!
