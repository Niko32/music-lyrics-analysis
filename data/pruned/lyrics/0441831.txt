Whining man, you, get away from me
We seem happily, he take it from me
Whining man, you, get away from me
We seem happily, he take it from me
Whining man, you, get away from me
We seem happily, he take it from me
Whining man, you, get away from me
We seem happily, he take it from me
Whining man, you, get away from me
We seem happily, he take it from me
Whining man, you, get away from me
We seem happily, he take it from me

[Chorus: Jeremy Loops]
I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to but it's good to see you
Tell me how you're doing
I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to
Anyway

[Verse 1: Jeremy Loops]
And in the light of day
I didn't know this
And everything she was
I didn't show this
And in the light of day
I didn't know you
But I wanted you to stay and I didn't wanna go
I wouldn't take it away from you, no no
You might also like[Chorus: Jeremy Loops]
I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to but it's good to see you
Tell me how you're doing (Cape Town, how you doing?)
I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to
Anyway

[Verse 2: Motheo Moleko, Jeremy Loops & Both]
I could of told you all the time
You wanted to hear it, eyes
I'm seeing it all clear
You seem to be surprised
Remember how we say
Someday we'll set sail
It took me so much, to get to where we are
And right now you are
Slowing me down down, slowing me down down
Trying to get up, you supposed to hold me down
It's different, ambiguous it may seem
The light shines in the dark
I couldn't see
And in the light of day
Everything we dreamed, I didn't know this
It's how you react, it's the kinda dream
And Everything she was, I didn't show this
But I'm tearing up these scenes
Tearing up these scenes
Time it waits for no one, it took me
Twenty six years to feel this something
And I'll be damned if I let it slip away
[Chorus: Jeremy Loops]
I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to but it's good to see you
Tell me how you're doing
I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to
Anyway

[Verse 3: Jeremy Loops]
I've been lying awake
Up all night
On these higher stakes
In disguise
I've been dying to wake up and find
I've been low
In the light of day
With open eyes
In the time it takes
To decide
That I wanted you to stay and
I didn't wanna go
I wouldn't take it away from you no no

[Chorus: Jeremy Loops]
I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to but it's good to see you
Tell me how you're doing
I didn't want to leave you down south
When I said that I will call you, squeeze you a little bit of love
I didn't want to
Anyway
