You made my life so blue both night and day
You left me here behind, with a troubled worried mind
So broken hearted too just when I needed you

I cried, I cried, I prayed, lord, I tried, to forget you
And never call your name, what a shame, what a shame
You're the one who was to blame
You're the one who was untrue just when I needed you

You said, it's best we part, and never love again
And though it broke my heart, I won't complain
You know I love you still and dear I always will
Although you proved untrue just when I needed you

I cried, I cried, I prayed, Lord, I tried, to forget you
And never call your name, what a shame, what a shame
You're the one who was to blame
You're the one who was untrue just when I needed you

No matter where you wander, no matter what you do
There's a longing in my heart for only you
I love you just the same and I want you back again
Although you proved untrue just when I needed you

I cried, I cried, I prayed, lord, I tried, to forget you
And never call your name, what a shame, what a shame
You're the one who was to blame
You're the one who was untrue just when I needed youYou might also like
