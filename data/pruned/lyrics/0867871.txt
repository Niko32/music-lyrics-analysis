So dark... So dark, in the moonlight

Naked we worship the night sky...

No man can hold what the darkness can sow
Gonna leave an ugly skull when you go

Tongues like horns, violently born and new...soul
The soft dead awake alive in love
Hard for the hangmans daughter

Naked we worship the night sky
No man can hold what the darkness can sow
You're gonna leave an ugly skull when you goYou might also like
