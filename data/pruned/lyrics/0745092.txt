I was raised in it
Losing while the world was winning
And now I'm standing next to you
And I know what I'm gonna do

[Pre-Chorus]
They call me son, that is not my name
They call me boy, that is not my name

[Verse 2]
At every day's ending
My whole day was just beginning
Heart was almost turning blue
And I knew that I had to move

[Chorus]
They call me son, but that is not my name
They call me boy, that is not my name
They call me victor, that's what the people say
Cause I won't suffer a loss, not another day

[Bridge]
And you know because
And you feel it on the inside
And you know because
When you feel it on the inside
Oh, you feel it in your blood
When you feel it on the inside
You feel it deep inside
When you feel it
And it's something you will never ever feel again
You might also like[Verse 3]
So here am I standing
Standing on my feet demanding
Everything that's come to me
And I get back down on my knees

[Chorus]
They call me son, but that is not my name
They call me boy, but that is not my name
They call me victor, that's what the people say
Cause I won't suffer a loss, not another day

[Outro]
Oh that is not my name
Oh that is not my name
Oh, that is not my name
That is not my name
That is not my name
That is not my name
I won't suffer a loss, not another day
