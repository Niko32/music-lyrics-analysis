Don't make the same mistake again, and hold it in like you always do...
Just for tonight, let's take your past and put it all behind
And forget everything you've tried to hide
Cause all that doesn't matter anymore
Just close your eyes, and feel the air blow through your hair then hide
To let you choke to appreciate your life
For all the days you've wasted in the past
You need to make this moment last
Breath in, breath out, you've heard it all before
But nothing takes the pain away except the pain itself but its too painful to ignore
Stop your acting, your script's way too flawed
Go steal some new lines, for you to safely read off...
Just for tonight, let's take your past and put it all behind
And forget everything you've tried to hide
Cause all that doesn't matter anymore
Just close your eyes, and feel the air blow through your hair then hide
To let you choke to appreciate your life
For all the days you've wasted in the past
You need to make this moment lastYou might also like
