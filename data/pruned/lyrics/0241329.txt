They define as a degenerate
Decapitate the heads of the game, no I'm not innocent
Analyze the wounds and locate the fuckin' fingerprints
If you can't hear what I say, then read the muthafuckin' print
King to be but I was born peasant
Y'all just wrap, you see I'm usin' the present tense
My thoughts race on a cloud, attention deficit
Disorderly conduct while burnin' the melodic medicine
Or Maybe I need some Ritalin'
I'm just an obscene student on the scene that be riddlin'
Height at 5'2, who you think you belittlin'
You just a figurehead like husband of Kate Middleton
Direct approach, no middlemen
I know being raw makes me a little bit bitter than
Most of these artists hardheaded, skull thickenin'
Set them on the guillotine, death is imminent
Work ethic diligent
Ponder my mind and use it to your benefit
I question all beliefs and it's edifice
Torchin' herbs that relate to color of amethyst
You arm n hammer crack anarchist
Got me pissed, I'm fiend of the rhetoric
If it pop up in my train of thought then I'm pennin' it
Regret your actions performed, Go to church to complete your penance bitch
Matter of fact, I might as well  go to hell for this
Distribute this at school, still screamin' fuck censorship
If I was fresh prince I wouldn't fuckin' censor it
My state mind, manipulated now militant
You got straight A's? That don't justify  your brilliance
You bullshit, who you think you be bullyin?
Your logic wouldn't be any better as George Boolean
Call me durin role, where the hell is this hooligan?
Walk in class, y'all surprised I am attendin' it
Fuck droppin' out, Im just droppin' in
Fuck the credit, I'mma get my own shit to spend
Fuck a ghostwriter, my soul seeps out my pen
(Shut the hell up Rubel you just rambling again!)

My behavior may be at its peak
My arms too stubby, I'mma just jump in for the reach
I was sittin' in the bleachers  then went to the bench
Coach was talkin' bout change but didn't make any sense
Nowadays I can't calculate my gradients
Within the dirt I'm the only speck that's become radiant
Don't believe in church, does that make me an atheist?
I know your judgement of me determines if you play this shit
All actions have an consequence
Offensive cause you sittin' within defensive
Destiny don't make determine when you gone commence
Postponed dates you may question my relevance
I use the bars as my evidence
My metaphors euphoric that's my penmanship
Penicillin for their arrogance
Irritants when I'm  hearin' it!
Molten flames, so hot I'm muthafuckin' searin' it
I bathe in serenades, while Mary Jane proceeds to smoke weed with me
Home alone just us three, without this music I don't have any idea where I would be
