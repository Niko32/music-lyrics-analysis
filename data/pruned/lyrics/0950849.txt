The place you've been for the last two weeks
You said, I miss you, oh sweet boy, and will you come on down?
I woke up to my cold sheets and the smell of New Jersey
When do I get to wake up to you?
Tonight I can't forget that I've got these open wounds
It's such a drag
I can't forget you've gone
My ribs have parted ways
They said, We're not going to protect this heart you have
Woah hey, what can I do?
My lungs are breathing open air
And my spleen is dripping from my pants
Woah hey, what can I do?
You've left me here in the cold
And I miss you
You never told me it would be this hard
I think my body's saying so
When you aren't here, it's got to know
It's leaving me
But I hope that you're o.k
Even though I'm dying
I hope that you're still trying to have a killer time
Go see the volcanoes
Go see the rainforests
I'll be fine by myself
Yea, I'll be fine without these bones
Woah hey, what can I do?
My lungs are breathing open air
And my spleen is dripping from my pants
Woah hey, what can I do?
You've left me here in the cold
And I miss you
Whoa hey, miss you
Whoa hey, miss youYou might also like
