Un, deux, un deux, trois quatre
Wohoho ! Stand by me
Cause Commune et H20
When the night has come
Every land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No, I won't be afraid
No, I won't be afraid
Juste as long as you stand
Stand by me
So, darlin', darlin', stand
By me, wowo ! Stand by me
Wowo ! Stand
Stand by me, stand by meYou might also like
