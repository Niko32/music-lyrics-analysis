So tell me what's up?
Are you into me or you not?
If you not then it's cool, I just wanna know what you 'bout
See are you the type to play with a heart and string on emotions?
Or are you the type to fuck for a bit and then keep it going?
There's only one way to find out - gotta go make a move
You never told me a lie, but that don't make it the truth
I know a lot of couples, but a lot don't make it through
I made it from the bottom, the top's a hell of a view
But you know that already, that's just where you be a lot
Only look for progress and that's just what you see a lot
Most these niggas asking me for promo, lately
I just tell them four words: fuck you, pay me
Back to the topic, cause I'm only here a while
I used to feel inadequate but I'm feeling better now
I just hope you feel the same, when you think about me
We might end it all but I doubt it, just tell me what's up?

So tell me what's up?
Tell me what's up? (x7)

You might also likeYou and me are not really that similar
You're the type to talk about it, I'm the type to get it bruh
Back in the days I would trip over some little shit
Fantasizing about the life that I'm currently living in
Girls be singing my praise, treat them like a chorus
I never made varsity, but I might make a Forbes list
I just wanna have a Big Year like the Frat Pack
Drinking Ace of Spades now, and I ain't even Blackjack
I'm never out of style cause I can always envision
My left blinker broken, only make the right decisions
Get it on the first try
Never need a second chance
I wish these rappers Goodwill
Their flows are like my Secondhand
Those are hand-me-downs, I use 'em and I pass on
You can see me right behind her
I look like a bad thong
Sanitary champ
I'm the king of this shit
I got her bobbing up and down
Like I'm swinging this bitch
