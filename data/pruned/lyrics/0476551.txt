Unforgivable

[Verse 1: Sinima]
I got my car radio locked on Hot 9.7
When they take a commercial break, it's 105 second
Radio rap's cool, but the problem with it
Is that the motherfucking DJs get bribed to spin shit
So the population is force-fed these light hits
'Til there's no choice but to say, "I like that shit"
What they got? 20 tracks in regular rotation?
When's the last time an album dropped that's yo favorite?
Spinning it non-stop, memorizing the words
Got you feeling every drop of the shit you just heard
It only happens but so often, the glow darkens
Actions speak louder than words, there's no talking
You complain and claim that you don't like rap
I got love for everybody populating the map
There's no taking it back, it is what it is
I'ma stack these dollars, you can keep your two-cents, yeah

[Hook: Sinima]
Zip, zilch, nada
Not a thing comes close to the shit that we bring
It's got a ring to it
Meanwhile, we're unsigned, we gotta keep moving
It's just a matter of time, before they see who is
Next in line, who's next to shine
Who's tracks are fire, you can bet yo life
It's Sinima, remember the name
So you can, erk, park that shit up on memory lane

Yo, yo, yo
You'll be listening to this track and straight researching
Googling Prez KT like, "Why I never heard him?"
'Cuz believe it or not, I'm still unsigned
Waiting to start my career after 50 resign
I'ma keep rap floating in water, while others sink it
These fake rappers is fake rapping, and fake singing
Fuck 'em, 'cuz I really ain't the jealousy type
I'll just keep on living and continue to write
One day I'll be at the top, me and my squad
And you'll say, "Dude, back in '08 dropped some bombs"
I'm hungry, like the hippos in the board game shit
I'm hungry like your girlfriend, a anorexic bitch
I'll stay hungry, right now I'm skin and bones
But I know sooner or later, I'll eat like Star Jones
Remember my name, I can smell success
And when you spell "Prezidential" it's a "Z" not an "S"
(Prez)

Who's tracks are fire, you can bet yo life
It's (Prez KT), remember the name
