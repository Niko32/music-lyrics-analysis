Woah

[Verse 1: salem ilese]
Eyes up, you've been gone for a fortnight
My love, are you stuck in a fake life?
Can't win, if the prize is to waste your time
Now it's wasting mine

[Pre-Chorus: salem ilese]
And I know that we're close, but I'm lonely
Make me your only, won't win a trophy
But can it kiss you like this when you hold me?
Missing it lowkey, I'll say it slowly

[Chorus: salem ilese]
It's me or the PS5
Tell me how you wanna spend your night
Three's feeling way too tight
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over
Me or the PS5
Tell me which of us is more your type
Seems like you can't decide
So if it's not me, then I'm probably gonna run it over

[Post-Chorus: salem ilese]
Oh-oh (Yеah)

My love, know I'm in for the long ride (In for thе long ride)
I'm not playing games of the wrong kind (Of the wrong kind)
Could be keeping secrets and telling lies
But I'm just online

[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun]
And I can promise you, I'll never play ya
I'll find a way to show you I'm grateful
So I'm begging ya, two minutes only
You'll get a trophy, I'm staying faithful

[Chorus: Yeonjun, Taehyun]
It's me and the PS5
Tell me, why you makin' me decide? (Yeah)
Please, don't you see I'm live? (I'm live)
So if you don't leave, I can find a way to win you over
Me and the PS5
'Least you know where I'ma be at night (Yeah)
The score's never been this high (So high)
So if you don't leave, I can find a way to win you over

[Outro: salem ilese]
Me or the PS5
Me or the PS5
It's me or the PS
