My love don’t feel so lonely
Won’t you be mine tonight
While all the stars are so bright

Somewhere fly with me up high
Sharing our dreams in the sky
So far beyond compare
You’ll find it up all there

Don’t you wait 'till tomorrow
Don’t stay away, smile away the sorrow
And come tonight I pray somewhere up there
Far away from dispair

Our love will go strong I swear
High in the sky
Tears of joy we wil cry
And never we’ll say goodbye

So smile one smile at me
My love, I’ll make you happy
Lonely you, so shy
You make me laugh and cry

Don’t you wait 'till tomorrow
Don’t stay away, smile away the sorrow
And come tonight I pray somewhere up there
Far away from dispair
You might also likeOur love will go strong, I swear
High in the sky
Tears of joy we wil cry
And never we’ll say goodbye
