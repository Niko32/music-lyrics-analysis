That's when I started to pack
There's a place where two people can't change anymore
And that's right about where we're at

Grabbed my favorite CDs and my six pack of beer
A duffle bag full of my clothes
Didn't come here with much even leaving with less
Guess that's what you get when ya go

Back when we met I thought she was so me
And she told me I was so her
Playing that game of pleasing each other
Oh, it was so easy at first

Why, when and where everything changed
At this point who cares and who knows
But last thing I want is to carry this hate
But you can't make it stay when you go

The way that it was ain't the way that it is
We've come to the fork in the road
And it ain't about pride or who's wrong or who's right
There just comes a time when you know
But you'll be better off when you go
You might also likeGot caught in a moment way too surreal
I wasn't trying to stall
Just taking my steps one at a time
Taking in all the pictures on the wall

But I walked in the kitchen, said I better leave
Kinda hoping she might say don't
But she took a deep drag off that Marlboro light
And said shut the door behind you when you go

Yeah, she just took a deep drag off that Marlboro light
And said shut the door behind you when you go...
