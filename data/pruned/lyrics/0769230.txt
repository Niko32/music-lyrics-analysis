Of smashing a stone into another man's face
There was nothing of his nose or his eyes or his teeth
His blood splashed on my chest
And as I hoisted the stone above my head
With your hand on my shoulder you spoke to me
But I never did hear what you said
A telephone rang
And in Detroit, in an abandoned mansion
A policeman was strolling, he was warning me
And at the foot of my bed he sat smiling, expectantly
So I took the birthday belt from my jeans
Slashing leather across his cheek
As I swung and I swung once again
His skin bloomed like a flower hungry for the Spring
I had a dream last night
I walked the road with my father's feet
And I could see everything I ever wanted
Just floating in space
I had a dream last night
Of you on the floor on your hands and knees
And my fingers were strumming inside of you
And you had a microphone in your face
I had a dream last night
You were on a train going East
Over mountains and tunneling into the Earth
You had gone away
And when you'd traveled as far as you could
You turned and looked back and you waited for me
But I was too fragile and frail to follow you
So I just waved like the seaYou might also like
