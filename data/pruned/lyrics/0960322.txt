Dwell your hidden lies
Disorientation is breathing near
To find a soul that cries

Face yourself
In trembling fear
Arrival of death
Is drawing near

Neutral;dead is your mind
Is this the death you awaited
Thoughts make a painful grind
To your brain...dictated

Take the dagger
Use it now
A fast cut
And blood will flow

Desperation covers you
The light you can't find
The voice that speaks is maybe true
But for that fact you are blind

Someone is entering your inner soul
Someone with good intentions
But the feelings is very cold
And your mind flows with tension
You might also likeAs you sink into your soul
Your corpse will drift away
What is left? A brainless ghoul?
Racing towards its grave

Face yourself
In trembling fear
Arrival of death
Is drawing near

End of life drastically reached
But why couldn't it end?
A voice in your heart has suddenly
Preached
Perhaps some light will be sent

You took the dagger
You've used it now
A fast cut
But death didn't show

The solution is total lie
You have been betrayed
No one hears your hollow cry
The last breath is made
Holding the dagger with a nervous grin
You push it inside your heart
Blood spew from inside within
And your life is torn apart
