Life has come a long way since yesterday (I say)
And it's not the same old thing over again (I say)
Just do what you feel and don't you fool yourself (I say)
'Cause I can't make you happy unless I am (I say, I say)

[Hook]
I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself
I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself

[Verse 1]
Day in day out, I've asked many questions (I say)
Only to find the truth it never changes (I say)
If you don't deal with it, it keeps killing you a little by little (I say)
Call me selfish if you will, my life I alone I can live (I say, I say)

[Hook]
I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself
(In a way now)
I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself

[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts, I'm tired of lies and all these games
I've reached a point in life, hey, no longer can I be this way
Don't come crying to me, I too have shed my share of tears
I'm moving on, yes I'm grooving on
Hey, well I'm finally free

I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself
(In a way oh)
I've got to be true to myself, I've got to be true to myself
(Come on now)
I've got to be true, I've got to be true
I've got to be true to myself (In a way oh)
I've got to be true, I've got to be true
I've got to be true to myself
