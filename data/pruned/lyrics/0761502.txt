Set a path and that is where I go
Casting around
Through the dots and the lines
With the energy to breath life into a stone

If it's honesty you're seeking
It's there if you push me hard enough
It's gonna be the end of me
But I'm here if you push me
If you push me

Dolugs with no other function
Than to cut the lines
And bring a sense of closure
Moving away from the punchings
But I know you'll break
Every law of motion

If it's honesty you're seeking
It's there if you push me hard enough
It's gonna be the end of me
But I'm here if you push me
If you push meYou might also like
