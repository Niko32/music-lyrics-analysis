See, I love you
Till you don't know (miss)
See, I love you
Till the far side of dawn
In the morning
If you (miss) me
Don't leave with your apologies
If you come back
If I liked you at all
Remember I liked you to fall on your knees

[Chorus]
Liar, liar, you're my last desire
Thought your kind of love was just a thorn of the rose
Tried to be faithful
Not hard enough I suppose
Tried hard to drown with a hum and a drum
In a pretty drug slum mire tried bearing your sighs
And your sneers and your frown
Tried wearing your jewels
And your heels and your crown
But it was nothing but a twist of barbwire

[Verse 2]
See, I promise
I'll be constantly clean
Did you think that
I still say what I mean
Now you're -
And you have to decide
Will you open your legs or your eyes
Do you pray
Cause I pray all the time
Cause the soul can't escape
What the heart can't disguise
You might also like[Chorus]
Liar, liar, you're my last desire
Thought your kind of love was just a thorn of the rose
Tried to be faithful
Not hard enough I suppose
Tried hard to drown with a hum and a drum
In a pretty drug slum mire tried bearing your sighs
And your sneers and your frown
Tried wearing your jewels
And your heels and your crown
But it was nothing but a twist of barbwire
It was nothing but a twist of barbwire
It was nothing but a twist of barbwire
