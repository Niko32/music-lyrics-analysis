Wooden lion on your knee
Washed and dressed by mountain hand
Came from water to the sand

Promise me, Caspian Sea
Caspian Sea, Caspian Sea
Caspian Sea, Caspian Sea

Caspian Sea, Caspian Sea

Where've you been? Where I can't see?
Wooden lion on your knee
Washed and dressed by mountain hand
Came like water to the sand

Promise me, Caspian Sea
Caspian Sea, Caspian Sea
Caspian Sea, Caspian Sea
Caspian Sea, Caspian Sea
Caspian Sea, Caspian Sea
Caspian Sea, Caspian Sea
Caspian Sea, Caspian SeaYou might also like
