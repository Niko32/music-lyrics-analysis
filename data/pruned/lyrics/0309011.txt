[Verse 1]
Wait until it fades to black, ride into the sunset
Would I lie to you? Well, I’ve got something to say
Grab your six-gun from your back, throttle the ignition
Would I die for you? Well, here's your answer in spades

[Pre-Chorus]
Shotgun sinners, wild-eyed jokers, got you in my sights
Gun it while I’m holding on

[Verse 2]
After all is said and done, climb out from the pine box
Well, I’m asking you, 'cause she's got nothing to say
The angels just cut out her tongue, call her black Mariah
Would I lie to you? That girl's not right in the brain

[Pre-Chorus]
Mass convulsions strike the choir by the grace of God
Gun it while I’m holding on

[Chorus]
But don't stop if I fall, and don't look back
Oh, baby, don't stop, bury me, and fade to black

[Bridge]
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
She won't stop me, put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door (Whoa!)
She won't stop me, put it down (Yeah!)
She won't stop me, put it down (Let's go!)
She won't stop me, put it down
So get your gun and meet me by the door (Whoa!)
She won't stop me, put it down (Yeah!)
She won't stop me, put it down (Whoa!)
She won't stop me, put it down
So baby

[Chorus]
Don't stop if I fall, and don't look back
Oh, baby, don't stop, bury me, and fade to black
But don't stop if I fall, and don't look back
Oh, baby, don't stop, bury me, and fade to black
[Outro]
Don't stop! Well, don't stop! Don't stop!
