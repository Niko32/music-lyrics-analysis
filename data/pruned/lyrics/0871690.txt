When I was a young man
I used to seek pleasure
When I was a young man
I used to drink ale
Out of the alehouse
And into a jailhouse
My body is ruined
And I'm bound to die

[Verse 2]
Send for the preacher
To come and pray for me
And send for a doctor
To heal up my sores
My poor head is achin'
My sad heart is breakin'
My body is ruined
And I'm bound to die

[Verse 3]
Get six pretty ladies
To bear up my coffin
Get six pretty ladies
To sing me a song
Let each of them carry
A bunch of wild roses
To lay on my coffin
As they pass along

When I was a young man

When I was a young man

Out of the alehouse
And into a jailhouse
My body is ruined
And I'm bound to die
