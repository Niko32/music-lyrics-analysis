What would you do when I sang out of tune
Would you stand up and walk out of me
Lend me your ears and I sing you a song
And I try not to sing out of key

[Chorus I:]
I get by with a little help from my friends
I get high with a little help from my friends
Gonna try with a little help from my friends

[Strophe II:]
What do I do when my love is away
Does it worry to be alone
What do I feel at the end of the day
Are your sad because you're on your own

[Chorus I]

[Chorus II:]
Do you need anybody
I need someone to love
Do you need anybody

[Strophe III:]
Do you believe in a love at first sight
I' am sure that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn off the light
I can't tell you but I know it's mine
You might also like[Chorus I]

[Chorus II]

[Chorus I]
