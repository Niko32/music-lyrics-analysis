Lord, I can't use them any more
Life so cold I feel
My prayers don't reach the sky no more
Formed from the dust of earth and water
You kissed the breath of life into me
I've held the hand that holds back the reins
And it set me free to rest in peace
Dust to dust

Born a child of mercy
Bred by the powers that moves the seas
When my day is done
And my time is finally come
From the ashes Your love will carry me
Formed from the dust of earth and water
Fed by the fire that quenched my soul
I've held the hands that hold back the reins
And it set me free to rest in peace
Ashes to ashes
Shadows whisper my name
Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes
And now I'm leaving this game
To rest in peace
Dust to dust
You might also likeI see the storm clouds comin'
Seven horses ride
By the moonlight's glow in a crimson sky

A band of angels, seven voices cry
No more, no more child
Don't you cry no more

Formed from the dust of earth and water
You kissed the breath of life into me
I've held the hands that hold back the reins
And it set me free
And it set me free
And it set me free
Ashes to ashes
Shadows whisper my name
Ashes to ashes
Ashes to ashes
I'm leaving this game
To rest in peace
Dust to dust
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Ashes to ashes
To rest in peace
Dust to dust
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
