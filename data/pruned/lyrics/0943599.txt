And just start over with you
There'd be no memory of who I used to be
I'd just be someone you never knew

If I could be a stranger in your eyes
Maybe then you'd give me one more try
I'd know just what to do to keep from losing you
You'd never know the tears I made you cry
If I could be a stranger in your eyes

If you didn't know me now like you didn't know me then
You wouldn't know you didn't love me anymore
I can hold you in my arms whisper things I never said
And love you like I never been before

If I could be a stranger in your eyes
Maybe then you'd give me one more try
I'd know just what to do to keep from losing you
You'd never know the tears I made you cry
If I could be a stranger in your eyes

I wish I was still a stranger in your eyesYou might also like
