But I'm just a natural born travelin' man I'm doin' what I think I should poor boy
I'm doin' what I think I should
Hey I don't give a damn about a greenback dollar spend it as fast as I can
For a wailin' song and a good guitar's the only thing that I understand poor boy
The only thing that I understand

When I was a little babe my mama she said son
Travel where you will and grow to be a man wnd sing what must be sung poor boy
Sing what must be sung
Hey I don't give a damn...

Now that I'm a grown man I've travelled everywhere
I've learned that a bottle of brandy and a song the only ones who ever cared poor boy
The only ones who ever cared
Hey I don't give a damn...
Hey I don't give a damn...You might also like
