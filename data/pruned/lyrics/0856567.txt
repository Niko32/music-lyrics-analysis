She'd get tired of me...
And leave me all alone...
But she did...

[verse 1:]
Looking back on the argument
All of it seems to turn into a great big blur
(don't recall all that you'll say yo this relationship is fate)
Dead in the water I thought
Her response to my blatant disrespect would be her
(regular thing) regular thing
(cry a bit then eventually get over it; get over it)

[pre-Chorus:]
(not this time) shorty got hip to the game
(not this line) or that line would work
I normally could talk a bum into buyin' dirt
I normally could talk a nun up out her skirt but
(not this time) she wasn't good for
All my sweet talk no not at all
Nobody to blame was all my fault
Tried to be slick messed around and got caught
I assumed she would forgive me (like every time)
But instead she said she's leaving

Click click bang bang
She hit me with click click bang bang
Shot right through my heart
Click click bang bang
That awful sound my baby shot me down
Click click bang bang
She hit me with click click bang bang
Shot right through my heart
Click click bang bang
That awful sound my baby shot me down

[verse 2:]
Well I messed up and talked to her girl
And my world 'bout to crumble before my eyes
(I don't know why I did it but she was there so I did it oh)
And when I say I did it I mean I did it
I smacked it I flipped it I rubbed it she loved it (she loved it)
So much she had to tell her girlfriend
(who happened to be) my girlfriend

[pre-Chorus:]
(ooh-ooh-ooh I guess that
Was the straw that broke the camel's back)
Cuz there wasn't no talkin' after that
Came home and her bags was already packed
(not this time) she wasn't good for
All my sweet talk no not at all
Nobody to blame was all my fault
Tried to be slick messed around and got caught
I assumed she would forgive me
But instead she said she's leaving
[Chorus:]
Click click bang bang
She hit me with click click bang bang
Shot right through my heart
Click click bang bang
That awful sound my baby shot me down
Click click bang bang
She hit me with click click bang bang
Shot right through my heart
Click click bang bang
That awful sound my baby shot me down
Click click bang bang
She hit me with click click bang bang
Shot right through my heart
Click click bang bang
That awful sound my baby shot me down
Click click bang bang
She hit me with click click bang bang
Shot right through my heart
Click click bang bang
That awful sound...

My baby shot me down...
