I watch you as you wake and rub your eyes
And try to hide them from the morning sun
I whisper, "How you doing?"
And you smile and say so tenderly, "Good morning hun!"

[Chorus]
Last night you made his memory fade a little
You helped me see how love can still be right
I wish you didn't have to leave
If you just knew how much I need
Last night, every night

[Verse 2]
I know you have to catch a plane to Memphis
And you mentioned it's an early flight
You start to pack
And while I comb my hair
I stare at you and think about last night

[Chorus]
Last night you made his memory fade a little
You helped me see how love can still be right
I wish you didn't have to leave
If you just knew how much I need
Last night, every night
You might also like[Verse 3]
I slip into my robe to go make coffee
You come in and pull me close to you
And as I feel your tender kiss
I whisper, "Can't Memphis wait a day or two?"

[Chorus]
Last night you made his memory fade a little
You helped me see how love can still be right
I wish you didn't have to leave
If you just knew how much I need
Last night, every night
Last night you made his memory fade a little
You helped me see how love can still be right
I wish you didn't have to leave
If you just knew how much I need
Last night, every night
