Jumping out of bed cause there are good things on the way
A positive feeling in my heart, I knew I couldn't fail
And the records I had ordered finally came in the mail
So angry kids, go away
No negativity today
Every little thing seemed to go my way
I gotta say it was a positive day
Telephone's ringing, I've got it made
Got a call from a girl that I've had a crush on since the first grade
Everything's going perfectly, that's what it's all about
And not a single straight edge kid has sold out
Got to the show, it started on time
And no one on the guest list cut in front of me in line
Five dollar door, I had money to spare
The bands were ALL GOOD and my friends were ALL THERE
Everyone dancing and no one got hurt
And even the tough guy kept wearing his shirt
And since a positive outlook is leading the way
I'm sure tomorrow will be as positive AS TODAYYou might also like
