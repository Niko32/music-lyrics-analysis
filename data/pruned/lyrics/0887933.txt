Without time, there's no devotion
Without you, there's only time
Making the most situations
Living on love that's living blind

[Chorus]
You say you're not affected
You always read between the lines
Not even happiness falling down
Can ever change your mind

[Verse]
The level's rising on the river
We just go where the current goes
There's no sense in a heartache
A condition that's always known

[Chorus]
You say you're not affected
You always read between the lines
Not even happiness falling down
Can ever change your mind

[Verse]
There's a reckless side of tradition
A push of the tide having its way
Conventional wisdom doesn't offer
Burning answers on display
You might also like[Chorus]
You say you're not affected
You always read between the lines
Not even happiness falling down
Can ever change your mind

Not even happiness falling down
Can ever change your mind
