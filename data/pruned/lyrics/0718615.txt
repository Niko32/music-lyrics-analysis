Three sums with a calculator add ‘em up, scalar
Rapping as Im solving see how far
I can go without looking at my TI 8-4, vector
I’m harder than chapter 2, invincible
Schooling Goldbach, call me Tyler the Principal
Haters calling me polygonal, thinking Im a square
But the thought’s not sensible
My mathmetician, Imma scribble these symbols in
While kids is telling me that they ain’t getting the arithmetic
(Bro, math is simple)
Here’s the number to my tutor man
Tell him all your problems, he’s really awesome at solvin’ em
Graphing stalled, I sit fidgeting with digits
I told it to quit glitchin' this really ain’t a good time
For an error code, sheesh I thought I put in fine
This device just isn’t working, or maybe it’s a math crime
This the return of the trig, thats sine-co to cosines
This ain’t “A’s Sheet” or “Curved Lines”
I'm Based God in base 10 because when I spit I get dimes
I slipped myself some blue ritties
And worked around the clock like the mayor “Math City”
Speakers on that classical is really getting in me
Im not weird, just wanna boogie to some chopin
You might also likeWhat’d ya think of “Trig Shop”?
Nah man, Robin trig is robbin' em
I’ll beat ‘em all in buzz, ‘cause 27’s stopping ‘em
Get the pick the week while your grade’s in a sarcophagus
And I won't stop until my props come in
Im an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Nhien Tran Nguyen to be our math receiver
Red pen, black book, and bars hotter than fever
All I want, knowledge, no grades and credits don't need 'em
But where the smart ones at
I got something to teach em
It's some math books, cuz math kids never wanted to read em
Snap back, no ch ch cheatin’ teacher leaves
The Honor Code on top, and schemers know we catching knowledge thieves
