And die young
But make sure we're having fun
And they say the year that radio died
It was in nineteen eighty five

And we got so messed up

Tune in
Make out
Break up
It's New York City speed

Come on
Get in
Hang on
It's New York City speed

Pass out
Wake up
And I won't let you down

Sing till your heart is sore
You want more
Like life played back in fast-forward
And I knew the year that video died
It was in nineteen ninety five
You might also likeAnd we got so fucked up.....

Look good
Talk less
Act bad
It's New York City speed

Shut up
Put out
Come on
It's New York City speed

Dress up
Let go
And I won't let you down
