They understand how different it is in this profession
They all fall for all our excuses that we'll see them soon

You tell me that you love me, I tell you that I love you
And I don't have to be worried any more, oh
We are the last couple on the dance floor
Don't stop the music, don't stop the music
The last couple on the dance floor
When they cut the power they cut the whole world out

A train crash someone gets murdered there's a threat of war
We all laugh and say "Isn't that something!"
There's no cash, everybody panics and the sweat just pours

You tell me that you love me, I tell you that I love you
And I don't have to be worried any more, oh
We are the last couple on the dance floor
Don't stop the music, don't stop the music
The last couple on the dance floor
When they cut the power they cut the whole world out

People call and desperately try to invade our time
We say hey wait, we're trying to beat the record
They all fall for all our excuses but at least we're kind
You might also likeYou tell me that you love me, I tell you that I love you
And I don't have to be worried any more, oh
We are the last couple on the dance floor
Don't stop the music, don't stop the music
The last couple on the dance floor
When they cut the power they cut the whole world out
