On Jordan's stormy banks I stand
And cast a wishful eye
To Canaan's fair and happy land
Where my persuasions lie

[Chorus]
I'm bound for the promised land
I'm bound for the promised land
Oh, who will come and go with me?
I'm bound for the promised land

[Verse 2]
All those wide, extended plains
Shines one eternal day
There God's a son forever reigns
And scatters night away

[Chorus]
I'm bound for the promised land
I'm bound for the promised land
Oh, who will come and go with me?
I'm bound for the promised land

[Instrumental Break]
You might also like[Verse 3]
No chilling winds, no poison spread
Can reach that healthful shore
Sickness and sorrow, pain and death
Are felt and feared no more

[Chorus]
I'm bound for the promised land
I'm bound for the promised land
Oh, who will come and go with me?
I'm bound for the promised land

[Verse 4]
When shall I reach that heavenly place
And be forever blessed?
When shall I see my Father's face
And in His bosom rest?

[Chorus]
I'm bound for the promised land
I'm bound for the promised land
Oh, who will come and go with me?
I'm bound for the promised land

[Verse 5]
Filled with delight, my rested soul
Would ever longer stay
Though Jordan's waves around me roar
There bliss alone shall weigh
[Chorus]
I'm bound for the promised land
I'm bound for the promised land
Oh, who will come and go with me?
I'm bound for the promised land
