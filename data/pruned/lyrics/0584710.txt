I can see your smile
I can hear your laugh
No I don't have to look back
I remember you

When I'm all alone
You're all around
I tell you things, yeah I talk out loud
Ever since you left the ground
I remember you

You can ask the sun
You can ask the moon
Every day that goes by
I remember you

And even when
I close my eyes
Like a dream, you come back to life
I can't escape your love, your light
I remember you

You can ask the sun
You can ask the moon, yeah
Every day that goes by
I remember you
You might also likeAnd I know some day
Only God knows when
I'll touch your face
And I'll breathe again
And life goes on, so until then
I remember you

Yeah, I remember you
Mmmmmmm
Every day that goes by
Oooooh
I remember you
