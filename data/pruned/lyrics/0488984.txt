Last night I met a woman
You'll recognize her name
Who, in our conversation
Told me you were her old flame
Well, I didn't want to listen
But as she told me more
I learned more about you
Than I'd ever known before

[Chorus]
(You're keepin') too many secrets from me
But, baby, now I'm wise to you
You'll fool me like the others
And I know what you'll do
You'll find yourself a new love
And keep me a secret, too

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Well, I walked up to a counter
To buy some cigarettes
And standin' there beside me
Was a gal I'd never met
She pulled out her wallet
And, much to my surprise
There she held your picture, baby
Right before my eyes
You might also like[Chorus]
(You're keepin') too many secrets from me
But, baby, now I'm wise to you
You'll fool me like the others
And I know what you'll do
You'll find yourself a new love
And keep me a secret, too

Too many secrets from me
But, baby
Now I'm wise to you
You'll fool me like the others
And I know what you'll do
You'll find yourself a new love
And keep me a secret, too
You'll find yourself a new love
And keep me a secret, too
