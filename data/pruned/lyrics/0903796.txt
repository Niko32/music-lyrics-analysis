And everything I do
Will always be for you
I hope you don't mind
I'll share my feelings
Feelings for you

The first time I saw you
I knew that you're the one
Then I'll be waiting for for all this time

Coz I'll be close to you
No matter where you are
And I'll be close to you
And this I swear
And this I swear is true

Hand in my heart
I promise you
My love is for you
And believe it conflicts may arise
But I'll be right here waiting for you

And I'll stand with you
Until the end of time(end of time)
And I'll be waiting here
If you would say goodbye
You might also likeCoz I'll be close to you
No matter where you are

And I'll never ever say goodbye
I don't know why I'm willing to try
This lonely heart belongs to you

Coz I'll be close to you
No matter where you are
And I'll be close to you
And this I swear
And this I swear

Coz I'll be close to you
No matter where you are

No matter where you are (close to you)
And I'll be close to you (close to you
