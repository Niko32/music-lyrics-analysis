Well, if you didn't love me
Wish you'd have told me
Then I wouldn't even let it throw me
When we got down to New York City
We got down to the nitty gritty

[Chorus]
Well, I didn't mean to bring you down now
Well, I guess I got to be myself now
'Cause I sure can't be nobody else now
Yeah, they say that I'm a millionaire now

[Verse 1]
Well, ya told me just outside of Austin
That you'd stick with me 'til Boston
When a movie star from the city
He took away my nitty gritty

[Pre-Chorus]
