Well I've been sort of worried
About Santa Claus this year
Because we live way down south
And it didn't snow down here
But I'm telling you not to worry
Because I just got the word
Everybody listen closely
And I'll tell you what I heard

[Chorus]
Santa's coming in a pickup
Instead of his trusty sleigh
He'll have a truck instead of reindeer
To carry him on his way
Because the weatherman had some problems
He couldn't get snow you see
Santa's going to come in a pickup truck
When he visits you and me

[Verse 2]
Santa can't bring his reindeer
He'll leave them far away
But don't you worry about him
He's going to be here Christmas day
He's got a big red pickup
With four-wheel drive and all
And there's going to be a Merry Christmas
A Merry Christmas for all
