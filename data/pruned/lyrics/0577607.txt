The way you move your hands
Through your hair when you feel alone
Through your hair when you feel alone

Remember the flowers you picked
When we crossed over Madison?
You were so sure you found yourself
That you branded it into an oak
The one you swore reached through the sky
And swallowed the city line
You had yet to hit twenty-three
An age that would swallow you
Then, every breath made you confess
You did not know what to do with your hands
This is a new side of you
So full of fearYou might also like
