Oh, how I want it, I wonder to you
In all these hardtimes, the good times got lost
It can be as it was

When we were true lovers
When there was trust

CHORUS
Can you forgive me for what I have done
Can you love me or will you be gone
Cause I need you to be by my side
So I want lie no more

When will we learn not to hurt one an other
I dont want to lose you, I want you to stay
When we grow older I know that we'll say
We we're ment to be

As we were when we were true lovers
And there still was trust

Can you forgive me, for what I have done
Can you love me, or will you be gone
Cause I need you to be by my side
So I won't lie no more
You might also likeLet's not waste time fighting, going nowhere fast
So lets stand strong together with this heartache in the past

Can you forgive me, for what I have done
Can you love me, or will you be gone
Now I need you, to be by my side
You ain't gonna cry no more x
