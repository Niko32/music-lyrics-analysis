You're the kinda girl who makes a man, wanna fall in love, and that's ok
'Cause I'm a man who will, fall in love, with you any day, how 'bout it baby?
We can cuddle by the fireplace
I would love to feel your warm embrace (embrace)
Girl it's you I want to have at home
But there's one thing that I've got to know
Oooh, it's..

[Chorus]
Would you be, my, sweet, heart
Would you be my, my, lady
Would you be, my, sweet, heart
Come on baby be my, my, my lady

[Verse 2]
Secret lover undercover is, what I wanna be, for you and me
Every hour on the dollar is, how I want to please, you my baby
We can cuddle by the fireplace (cuddle by the fireplace)
I would love to feel your warm embrace (warm embrace)
Girl it's you I want to have at home (have at home)
But there's one thing that I've got to know

[Chorus & Outro]
Baby, would you be my, my, sweet, heart
Come on baby, would you be, my, lady
Baby would you be my, my, sweet, heart
