They like to talk about the
The problems, but the, the problem is, uh
They can't solve 'em, but they can talk a lot about 'em
They can talk about the
The woman, get the, the short end, which, uh
We cannot lengthen, but we can talk at length about 'em

[Chorus]
Shout if you know
Shout if you know, if you know
Shout if you know
Shout if you know
Shout, shout, shout

[Verse 2]
They like to talk about the
The children, gettin' stepped on by the
The boot squad, but that don't get 'em steppin' off 'em
And they can talk about a politic, rhetoric
Derelict, intellect, talk show with American
But I still can't make sense out of it

[Chorus]
Shout if you know
Shout if you know, if you know
Shout if you know
Shout if you know
Shout if you know
Rock 'n roll if you don't, if you don't know
Rock 'n roll, you gotta keep rockin' if you don't know

Hush up, buttercup
You talkin' all too often
Rest your lips, soliloquist
And save it up, save it up, just save it up, yeah
Pipe down, anchorman
You've got your story turned around
Take a tip from the old Carthusians
And save it up, save it up, just save it up, yeah

[Chorus]
Shout if you know
Shout if you know, if you know
Shout if you know
Shout if you know
Shout if you know
Rock 'n roll if you don't, if you don't know
Rock 'n roll, you gotta keep rockin' if you don't know
Shout if you know
Shout if you know, if you know
Shout if you know
Shout if you know
Shout, shout, shout
