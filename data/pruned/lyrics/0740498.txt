If I could begin to be
Half of what you think of me
I could do about anything
I could even learn how to love
When I see the way you act
Wondering when I'm coming back
I could do about anything
I could even learn how to love
Like you
[Verse 2]
I always thought I might be bad
Now I’m sure that it's true
‘Cause I think you’re so good
And I’m nothing like you
[Verse 3]
Look at you go
I just adore you
I wish that I knew
What makes you think I'm so special
[Verse 4]
If I could begin to do
Something that does right by you
I would do about anything
I would even learn how to love
You might also like[Verse 5]
When I see the way you look
Shaken by how long it took
I could do about anything
I could even learn how to love like you
[Outro]
Love like you
Love me, like you
