It's been seven long hours
Since you left me babe
Sitting here
Thinking 'bout how
How you let it slip away
I can't get no sleep
(No sleep)
Don't even wanna
Go nowhere
It's on my mind
What you did wrong
And now you
Wanna come back

When a man does wrong
Ain't no coming back home
He's been out there too long
She won't even
Talk on the phone
(Said when, Said when)
When a man does wrong
Ain't no coming back home
Can't come around
There ain't no place
She don't wanna
See your face
You might also likeSaid you never
Wanted to hurt me
Never even wanted to leave
Said that you'd
Never desert me
Now you begging me
Please, please, please believe
Now you feeling like a fool
(Fool)
Never thought about me
Just you

It's on your mind
What you did wrong
And now you
Wanna come back

When a man does wrong
Ain't no coming back home
He's been out there too long
She won't even
Talk on the phone
When a man does wrong
Ain't no coming back home
(No, no, no, no)
Can't come around
There ain't no place
She don't wanna
See your face
Why'd you have
To do it baby?
Do it do it to me
Why'd you have
To use and abuse me?
See I've been sitting
Waiting at night
Just wasting my time
(Wasting my time)
Now, now I know
Now I know
Gotta go gotta go
(Yeah go, yeah go, yeah)

When a man does wrong
Ain't no coming back home
Can't come around
There ain't no place
She don't wanna
See your face

Thank you I appreciate your kindness!!! -me!!
