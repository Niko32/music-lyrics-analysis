Oh, oh, oh
One man
Once died
But did you know that he could read all our minds?
He was the U.S. Adam with Jack the wife
He was a hyper-charismatic, telepathical knight

*Even though I am better than you, I am not.*

[Verse 2:]
His parents were an academic team of elites
Their goal was to raise the future human supreme
He smelled like the future
His words felt like flowers
And if he shook your hand you'd make love with it for hours
A list? Let's
Soldier? Check
Flight? True
Commie? No
Rich? Quite
And was he the true cousin of Sir Jesus Christ?
You fuckin' know he was, man
You might also likeOh, oh, oh
Made love
Read minds
Went inside of more than half of mankind
Let us down, but shit, how could we mind?
He was a handsome devil
But the kind of devil you like
Oh, oh
Wore suits
Sometimes
Starred in movies that appeared in our minds
He knew the secrets of all space and time
And if he liked you, he would tell you
But you had to unwind

*You don't know it, but you are full of stars.*

[Verse 3:]
"He understands my shit."
Said the short and the tall
He saw a million faces
And he sexed them all
I saw him heal a zebra
I saw him love his wife
I saw him bless a demon and that demon changed its life
Some secrets never aired about the sex-lord elect
Let us go back to the start
When JFK was just specs
No one knew
No one guessed
Due to all of his flaws
That the world's most human mo-fo
Wasn't human at all
Oh, oh
Fake man
Great stats
Never sat to empty out all his crap
How could a program love and fuck so sweet?
He was a hyper-sympathetic telepathic machine

[Hook:]

[Outro JFK:]
*Man is still the most extraordinary computer of all
And women are even cooler.*
