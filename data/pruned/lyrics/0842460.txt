Neighbors stare and wonder
We're a man and wife in love
With each other

Today a friend of mine came by
Said let's do the town
I can't fix you up
With a cutiest thing around

She's what I was jokin'
When I told him patiently
The only woman that I want
Is waitin' at home for me

We're that odd couple on our street
Neighbors stare and wonder
We're a man and wife in love
With each other

A neighbor on our left
Talked with our neighbor on our right
A man across the street
Goes out almost every night

I've heard a different man each night
Each is life company
They all think we're square
'Cause we're happy as can be

Neighbors stare and wonder
We're a man and wife in love
With each other

Yes, we're a man and wife
In love with each other...
