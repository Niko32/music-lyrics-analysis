Time has turned a million pages fate has dealt and I'm alone

But somewhere along life's highway from your new love you may part
And you will reap the pains my darling that go with a broken heart

The little stars all twinkled brighter the moon smiled gaily from the blue
The flowers seemed to spread more beauty oh so glad cause I met you
But somewhere along life's highway...

Though you've made my life a failure I have never been untrue
And these lonely years have wasted all because my love for you
But somewhere along life's highway...

You played your game to leave me darling your game I did not understand
So you dealt the cards against me and I played the losing hand
But somewhere along life's highway...You might also like
