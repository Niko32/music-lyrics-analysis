Here she comes, looking over her neck
People run the world while staying on the street, alright
You are upset... in a town that you didn't like
You know why, you're gonna catch up alright
You're gonna catch her alright
Oh, it's so good
Here she comes like a hurricane
I thought I saw him come, but I just got rain
People round the world work hard to drive you inane
You are upset... staying now in the rain
You know why, you're gonna catch up alright
You gonna catch her alright
Oh, it's so goodYou might also like
