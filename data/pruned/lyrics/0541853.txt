We let it all fall apart
Then settle back in a place
Treading water in the dark
Waiting for the tides to change

[Refrain]
Even when you try to be without
Feel the pressure of the waves crash down
When you try to run I pull you in
Cause you know you'll always be around
I know ive been a fool
The shit I put you through
No matter what you do
You just can't refuse

[Verse 2]
You hate the way I get so high
And I hate the way you care so much
You burn a bridge you cross a line
It's all too much but not enough

[Refrain]
Even when you try to be without
Feel the pressure of the waves crash down
When you try to run I pull you in
Cause you know you'll always be around
I know you've been a fool
The shit you put me through
No matter what I do
I just can't refuse
You might also like[Bridge]
Can't give it up
You know I'm coming back to you
Can't give it up
I know you're coming back to me

[Outro]
I know I've been a fool
I should have pulled you through
No matter what you do
You just can't refuse
Can't refuse
