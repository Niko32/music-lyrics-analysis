Lord have mercy here she comes
Behind the wheel of a pickup truck
Mudd slingin', she's singin'
Country girl just doin her thing and
Ain't nothing like a backwoods baby
Drive my tractor drive me crazy
Likes huntin', loves fishin'
And she can hold her own in the kitchen
And by the way boys did I mention

[Chorus: Rhean Boyer & Colt Ford]
She's pretty as a field of daisies
She's sweeter than watermelon wine
Way hotter than the Alabama asphalt
And when I get her in these arms of mine
Lord have mercy I love her kisses
Man I can't get enough
Kinda like chicken and biscuits

[Verse 2: Colt Ford]
She can rock them high heel shoes
But she'd rather where cowboy boots
Cut off jeans and a baseball hat
Them city girls can't do it like that
Off the chain on a Friday night
Dancin' and drinkin' ain't scared to fight
But Sunday mornin' comes rollin' 'round
In the choir is where she's found
Y'all makes me so proud
'Cause there ain't no doubt
You might also like[Chorus: Rhean Boyer & Colt Ford]
She's pretty as a field of daisies
She's sweeter than watermelon wine
Way hotter than the Alabama asphalt
And when I get her in these arms of mine
Lord have mercy I love her kisses
Man I can't get enough
Kinda like chicken and biscuits

[Bridge: Colt Ford]
(Hey)
Hey sweet thing let me hold you close
(Ohh)
Tthere's something that you need to know
(Hey)
When it comes to lovin' you
(Ohh)
There ain't nothin' that I'd rather do

[Chorus: Rhean Boyer & Colt Ford]
She's pretty as a field of daisies
She's sweeter than watermelon wine
Way hotter than the Alabama asphalt
And when I get her in these arms of mine
Lord have mercy I love her kisses
Man I can't get enough
Kinda like chicken and biscuits
