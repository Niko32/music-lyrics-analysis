I know this might sound crazy, but I don't know what I did
To Make you wanna leave
You think we been here before, I say I'm sorry
You come back I do it again, and then pack but girl it's different now
See every time we had it out, you would go to the door
I chase behind you and I talk your bag back down to the floor
You said that you needed time, could you get back to me
And let me know how long you need
Cause I can't take it no more

[Hook]
Since you been gone
I just can't seem to get right
And I miss you more than you'll ever know
Girl I just want a chance to talk to you
And let you know that I changed
Since you been gone
I stayed awake all night
This bed just ain't the same without you here
I feel like I lost it all
Since you been gone
Since you been gone from me  (Come here let me talk to you)

[Verse 2: Bryan]
You can't expect for me to let it go that easily
One day we're making plans, the next day girl you're leaving me
Okay so I'm a jerk, I know I made you hurt
And yea your girlfriend was right I got what I deserved
I know that last time, you said it was the last time
But baby all I need is one more last time
I'll make the best of it, I'll stop all my bullshit
And I'll become the man that you always wanted
