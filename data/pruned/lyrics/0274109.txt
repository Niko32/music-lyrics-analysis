I wasn't walking on water
I was standing on a reef
When the tide came in
Swept beneath the surface
Lost without a trace
No hope at all
No hope at all

[Chorus]
Oh, sweet miracle
Oh, sweet miracle
Oh, sweet miracle
Oh, sweet miracle of life

[Verse 2]
I wasn't walking with angels
I was talking to myself
Rising up to the surface
Raging against the night
Starless night

[Chorus]
Oh, sweet miracle
Oh, sweet miracle
Oh, sweet miracle
Love's sweet miracle of life
You might also like[Bridge]
Oh salvation
Oh salvation
Oh salvation
Oh salvation

[Verse 3]
I wasn't praying for magic
I was hiding in plain sight
Rising up from the surface
To fly into the light
Into the light

[Chorus]
Oh, sweet miracle
Oh, sweet miracle
Oh, sweet miracle
Oh, sweet miracle of life

[Chorus]
Oh, sweet miracle
Oh, sweet miracle
Oh, sweet miracle
Love's sweet miracle of life
