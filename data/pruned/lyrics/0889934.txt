Blue sky is all I wanna see
Raindrops don't you cry for me
And don't come back tomorrow

For I think today
I'll simply laugh and say
No more grey skies for you
I'll smile like the sun
Til the fever catches on
And I feel good through and through

So keep the rain
Give me the rainbow
Who needs sorrow
That's not what a heart is for
Keep the rain
Give me the rainbow
I don't wanna be blue no more

Raindrops I won't shed a tear
My heart sings far away from here
I can tell you my secret, dear
The sun will shine tomorrow

I used to fall apart
Every time the skies turned dark
But I found a trick you see
With laughter in my heart
Even when we part
I bring the sunshine with me
You might also likeToo many days I have wasted
The seed is all I tasted
Instead of the fruit, you see
So I'm turning over a new leaf
Hey, it's the new me

Keep the rain
Give me the rainbow
Keep the indigo
And give me the pot of gold
Keep the rain
Give me the rainbow
I don't wanna be blue no more
I don't wanna be blue no more
I don't wanna be blue no more
