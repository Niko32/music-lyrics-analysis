Just a matter of time before you turn it on me
Innocent of the crime but still I'm so guilty
Justified in your lies by all the little stuff I did
All along I've been living with a fugitive
Ooh, it ain't my fault now you're feeling lonely
Justified in your eyes by all the little stuff you give
All along I've been living with a fugitive

[Verse]
Face to face with mistakes all in disguise
Run away, cover your eyes
I'm used to it by now
When you catch a break, consequences all evade
So used to it by now
I'm so lucky I see right through you
So every time you do wrong I brace myself for the blame

[Chorus]
Just a matter of time before you turn it on me
Innocent of the crime but still I'm so guilty
Justified in your lies by all the little stuff I did
All along I've been living with a fugitive
Ooh, it ain't my fault now you're feeling lonely
Justified in your eyes by all the little stuff you give
All along I've been living with a fugitiveYou might also like
