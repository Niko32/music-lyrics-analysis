Ballin with my bitch
City with my bitch
In the car with my bitch
At the park with my bitch, and....
She love it
We're gonna kick it again

[Verse 1]

I don't have time to spend what you spend
Partying on weekends
Watch you hit on old boyfriends
Cause your minds stuck in what should have been
Yeah....
You know me
I've heard it all before, yeah, you know me
Miss I can get a dude that's better than this dude
And why buy food when I can get it from this foo
And say stupid shit so he thinks you're a prude
Like he convinced you to do anal boo....
And now I'm Will Arnett
Babe this, Babe that
Babe no, babe you're wack
Babe don't swing your fists like that
Babe why the hell are you so mad
You can't hurt me
Won't hit back
I'm the douche bag who don't give slack
I'm the douche bag who argues back
I'm the douche bag who don't spend cash
Cause I never get a piece of your ass ass ass
Thinking you're hot shit showing sassafrass
Like you're telling everybody that your name's BABS
No offence, but the cover girl shit don't last
Taking snapchats just to hide your past
If your assumptions were true, I'd be hanging all over you.........
Don't even think this through, I'll just treat you like a dog like you want me to
You might also like[Chorus X2]

Ballin with my bitch
City with my bitch
In the car with my bitch
At the park with my bitch, and
She love it
We're gonna kick it again

[Bridge]

You're in the pictures with your friends
Telling the world that you're social
Now you're normal
Now you're normal
Now you're normal
Congratulations

[Verse 2]

Dear Bitch
I wanna say that I'm great
Life without you is awesome
I can be myself nowadays
I've learned a lot this time
Thus I apologize...
That you think all guys objectify
You've morphed into that lie
Taking them cum shots to your face
And you smile back with odd faith
Wearing that skank clothe, slut grace
Over obsessed with being in shape
Bitch better exercise your brain waves
Before your body says its too late
I know lots of guys are fucked up
But girls play the most head games
Lets talk about you...
What's left that exists
You want to be loved or fucked?
You decide I'm done with this shit
Uh..........
I'm done with this shit
Bitch.........
