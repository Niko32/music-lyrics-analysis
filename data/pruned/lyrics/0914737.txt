So hard to say goodbye
But I just can't keep living this lie
Try to hold back my tears
But my heart still cries
Boy, if you, you only knew
The hardest part is saying goodbye

[Verse 1]
I never thought the day would come when
I would have to overcome
The love and joy and happiness that we once shared
But the pain inside my heart is too much for one soul to bear
It's hard enough to live this life without you, 'cause

[Chorus]
It's so hard to say goodbye
But I just can't keep living this lie
Try to hold back my tears
But my heart still cries
Boy, if you, you only knew
The hardest part is saying goodbye

[Verse 2]
Love is when you lose your only
Without you I'm eternally lonely
'Cause you were everything
And everything is you
But how could so much pleasure
Turn to so much pain
I never knew my sun could turn into rain, oh, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
It's so hard to say, so hard to say goodbye
But I just can't keep living this lie
Try to hold back my tears
But my heart still cries
Boy, if you, you only knew
The hardest part is saying goodbye

[Bridge]
I never thought that I would be
Singing that sad song
The one about living my life without you, oh oh oh

[Chorus]
It's so hard to say goodbye, goodbye, oh yeah
I just can't keep living this lie
I try to hold back my tears
But my heart still cries
If you only knew
The hardest part is saying goodbye

[Outro]
Goodbye, oh oh oh oh, goodbye, oh oh
But my heart still cries
Boy, if you, you only knew
The hardest part is saying goodbye
