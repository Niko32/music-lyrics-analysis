These arms of mine long to hold you again
Like they did long ago
The winds of time, if left untamed
Can chill the flame and kill its glow

[Chorus]
But this love in me still lives only to feel
That touch of yours in these arms of mine

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
This love in me still lives only to fee
That touch of yours in these arms of mine
That touch of yours in these arms of mineYou might also like
