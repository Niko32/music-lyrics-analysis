Everybody's laughin' in my face
I might as well be livin' in a tree
You made a monkey out of me

You made a monkey out of me
You got me crawlin' on my hands and knees
Even got me swinging through the trees
You made a monkey out of me

--- Instrumental ---

Well, the way that you walk on me it's true
I might as well be livin' in a Zoo
Everybody laughs at what they see
You made a monkey out of me

You made a monkey out of me
You got me crawlin' on my hands and knees
Even got me swinging through the trees
You made a monkey out of me
