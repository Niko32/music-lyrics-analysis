Well I've been wondering what I've been missing
I guess I should have known
But my heart does and it ain't whispering
It tells me just what it wants

[Verse 2]
Someone who knows what I like in my coffee
And the shape of my old hat
A lover who always looks at me not through me
I need a love like that

[Chorus]
I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
And I need a love like that

[Verse 3]
Well I need a new car but I can't afford it
So I'll keep patching that old flat
My heart's lonely and I can't ignore it
I need a love like that

[Chorus]
I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
And I need a love like that
You might also like[Verse 4]
Two young people dancing in the daylight
They don't care where they're at
Waiting on sunset and a holding on so tight
I need a love like that

[Chorus]
I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
And I need a love like that

[Verse 5]
One little baby hiding in the shadow
Of her daddy's hat
Loving and trusting and blindly she'll follow
I need a love like that

[Chorus]
I need a love like that
I could use a little sun on my back
A truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
And I need a love like that

[Outro]
Yeah, a truck needs a highway, a train needs a track
And I need a love like that
