Listen baby
Ain't no mountain high
Ain't no valley low
Ain't no river wide enough baby
If you need me call me
No matter where you are
No matter how far
Don't worry baby
Just call my name
I will be there in a hurry you don't have to worry

[Chorus:]
Cause baby there ain't no mountain high enough
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough
To keep me from getting to you, babe

[Verse II:]
Remember the day
I set you free, i told you can always count on me darlin
From that day on i made a vow, i will be there when you want me
Some way, some how

[Chorus]

Oh no darlin
No wind, no rain or winter's cold can stop me baby
No, no baby
Cause you are my own
If you're ever in trouble i'll be there on the double
Just sing for me oh baby, ha
My love is alive, way down in my heart
Although we are miles apart
If you ever need a helping hand
I'll be there on the double just as fast as i can
Don't you know that there
Ain't no valley low enough
Ain't no river wide enough to keep me from getting to you babe
Don't you know that there
Ain't no valley low enough[x2]
