Okay
Don't do it
Don't you try, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't do that (Don't, don't, don't)
Don't do that (You got a good thing goin' now)
Don't do it, don't do it, don't

[Chorus]
Don't try suicide, nobody's worth it
Don't try suicide, nobody cares
Don't try suicide, you're just gonna hate it
Don't try suicide, nobody gives a damn

[Verse 1]
So you think it's the easy way out?
Think you're gonna slash your wrists this time?
Baby, when you do it, all you do is get on my tits

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't do that (Try, try, try, baby)
Don't do that (You got a good thing goin' now)
Don't do it, don't do it, don't

You need help
Look at yourself, you need help (Yeah)
You need life
So don't hang yourself
It's okay, okay, okay, okay
You just can't be a prick teaser all of the time

[Verse 2]
A little bit attention? You got it
Need some affection? You got it (Hey)
Suicide, suicide, suicide bid (Oh)
Suicide, suicide, suicide bid (Uh)
Suicide (Hey)
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it, babe (Yeah)
Don't do it, don't do it, don't do it!
Hey

Don't put your neck on the line
Don't drown on me, babe
Blow your brains out
[Pre-Chorus]
Don't do that (Yeah)
Don't do that (You got a good thing going, baby)
Don't do it, (No) don't do it, (No!) don't

[Chorus]
Don't try suicide, nobody's worth it
Don't try suicide, nobody cares
Don't try suicide, you're just gonna hate it
Don't try suicide, nobody gives, nobody gives
Nobody gives a damn

[Outro]
