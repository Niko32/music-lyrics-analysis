So intricate becomes the bathroom floor
And even though you're in a ditch you dig a deeper hole
I'm a shovel it's out of my control
Promised to change
I didn't hear a word from you, don't hold me back
The exit isn't somewhere in my heart
A promise of pain
We're back to the start

The reason that I still persist it's obvious I care
Been waiting by the door with no one there
It seems that you are locked inside my key don't fit no more
And you're walking on the land mines you laid down before
Promised to change
I didn't hear a word from you, don't hold me back
The exit isn't somewhere in my heart
I didn't hear a word from you, don't hold me back
The exit isn't somewhere in my heart
A promise of pain
We're back to the startYou might also like
