Brace yourself, the climb is steep
You'll need every ounce of brawn
For the mountain won't stop 'til you bleed

[Verse 1]
Beware of headlines that volume the growing deceit
That justice will not begin to breed without smoke
Breed without smoke

[Chorus]
Keep close things you learned from the fall
And cast your wounds to heal without flaw
Keep close things you learned from the fall
And cast your wounds to heal without flaw

[Verse 2]
Beware
Beware for there's a zealot
Unleashed and sighting the end
Through a scope of righteousness that's blinded by blood on the lens
He won't stop until his claws reach his faults
And he sees he's not the hands of God

[Bridge]
He'll choke on the smoke
Choke on the smoke
You might also like[Chorus]
Keep close things you learned from the fall
And cast your wounds to heal without flaw
Keep close things you learned from the fall
And cast your wounds to heal without flaw
Keep close things you learned from the fall
And cast your wounds to heal without flaw
Keep close things you learned from the fall
And cast your wounds to heal without flaw

[Outro]
Cast your wounds
Cast your wounds or you'll choke on the smoke
Choke on the smoke
Choke on the smoke that you breathe from your own code
