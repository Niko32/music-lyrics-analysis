Down in Atlanta, GA
Under the viaduct ev'ry day
Drinkin' corn and holl'in' hooray
Pianos playin' 'til the break of day
But as I turned my head
I loudly said

[Chorus]
"Preach dem blues, sing dem blues
They certainly sound good to me"

[Verse 2]
I've been in love for the last six months
And ain't done worryin' yet
Moan dem blues, holler dem blues
Let me convert your soul
Oh, just a little spirit of the blues tonight
Let me tell you, girls, that your man ain't treatin' you right

[Verse 3]
Let me tell you I don't mean no wrong
I will learn you somethin' if you listen to this song
I ain't here to try to save your soul
Just want to teach you how to save your good jelly roll
You might also like[Verse 4]
Goin' on down the line a little further now
There's many a poor woman down
Read on down to chapter nine
Women must learn how to take their time
Read on down to chapter ten
Takin' other women's men, you are doin' a sin

[Chorus]
Sing 'em, sing 'em, sing dem blues
Let me convert your soul

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 5]
Now, one ol' sister by the name of Sister Green
Jumped up and done a shimmy you ain't never seen

[Chorus]
Sing 'em, sing 'em, sing dem blues
Let me convert your soul
