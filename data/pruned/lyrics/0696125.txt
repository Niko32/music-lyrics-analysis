Since I first saw you, I've been thinking about you
And now I'm out here on the highway going crazy without you
I can't help but want you, girl, you're young and pretty
But somehow I can't see you up in New York City now

[Chorus]
I'm gonna leave you alone in your own little world
Won't you be my San Antonio girl?
Be my San Antonio girl
Be my, be my, be my San Antonio girl

[Verse 2]
Now I know you've heard the story about the life in the fast lane
What they didn't tell you is you come home on a slow train
I'd just as soon remember you the way that I found you
Dancing by yourself with the stars all around you

[Chorus]
I'm gonna leave you alone in your own little world
Won't you be my San Antonio girl?
Be my San Antonio girl
Be my, be my, be my San Antonio girl

[Outro]
Hey now won't you, won't you be my San Antonio girl?You might also like
