And you showed me
The sincerity in your eyes
That touched my heart so deeply

I turned to walk away
But found to my surprise
There you were standing with open arms
Wide open, and baby, they were for me

I realized that I’d been sleeping
And you awoke the woman
Sleeping with truth and reality, ohoho
Ohoho, baby, ohoho, baby

Your lips wet like the rain from up above
Oh, how, how they touched me
And you’ll never know what you did for me
Yes, I was sleeping but now I see
Ohoho, baby, ohoho, baby

Ohohohohohoho
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah baby
Ohoho, baby, ohoho, babyYou might also like
