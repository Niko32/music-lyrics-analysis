I’ve stopped crying in my sleep
I’m alright but it’s all wrong
The only secret that I keep
Is I’ve been waiting for too long
I’ve been waiting for too long
And it seems I’m doing well
And I hope you are as well
I just drive around the world
Singing songs about a secret girl
Who’s been waiting for to long
Shes been waiting for too long
Sometimes I wish that you
Were here with me
Like I wish I could fly
Only you could ever set me free
Like a bird up in the sky
I’ve been waiting for too long
I’ve been waiting for too long
And my problems are hard to solve
Sometimes they all just seem way too involved
And I could wait for them too fade away
Until somebody turns to me and says
You’ve been for too long
You’ve been for too long
Sometimes I wish that you
Were here with me
Like I wish I could fly
Only you could ever set me free
Like a bird up in the sky
I’ve been waiting for too long
I’ve stopped crying in my sleep
I’m all right, I’m all right but it’s all wrong
The only secret that I keep
Is I’ve been waiting for too long
I’ve been waiting for too long
