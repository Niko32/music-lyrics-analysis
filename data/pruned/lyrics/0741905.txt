Walk me out in the morning dew, my honey
Walk me out in the morning dew, today
Can't walk you out in the morning dew, my honey
Can't walk you out in the morning dew at all
Thought I heard a young girl crying baby
Thought I heard a young girl crying today
You didn't hear no young girl crying baby
You didn't hear no young girl crying at all

[Chorus]
Now there's no more morning dew[x2]

[Bridge:]
What they were saying all this years was true
