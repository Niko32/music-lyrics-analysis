I see the night that she's alone
I keep thinking back to home
I've got that feeling I know that it show
I missed my sweet desert rose

Shines like the stars in the sky
A breath of life in a well gone dry
She picks me up but I feel it so low
She's my sweet desert rose

Ain't no money in our home town
And the mills have all shut down
They say: There's work but it's always the next town
Will you still love me when I'm gone

Will you still love me when I'm gone
Though the empty night and the days so long
I'm not the same and I guess that it shows
I missed my sweet desert rose

I hear the wind blowing in the night
Winter's come and it just ain't right
This loneliness but it comes and it goes
I love my sweet desert rose
