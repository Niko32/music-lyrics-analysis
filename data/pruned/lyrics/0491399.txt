Oh, ohh, yea, yeaaa, yo
[Verse 1: MTM]
I feel some pain, I hope it's not what I think it is
I see bees buzzing past it
If you dont know what I'm talking about, just listen to me

[Chorus]
There's a wolf inside of me
I'm insecure, there's a wolf inside of me,
I can't get it out, and If I don't get it out right now, I might fall

[Verse 2]
Everyday, I put on my turquoise shoes
And I see a creature in my brain, Mannequins are moving, I'm going insane
Is this Christmas, biting down on candy canes
This is some chaos

[Chorus](x2)

[Verse 3]
I'm in a time warp, falling through a mirror
I see a shadow, it's the wolf, insecureMy heart is like a waterfall, it's flowing.
[Hook](x5)
I feel the beat of its claws, banging up and down on the drum
[Verse 4]
I see the wolf, it's running and howling in to the forest, it's gone. I moved away to a new home where it's peaceful and quiet. I'm safeYou might also like
