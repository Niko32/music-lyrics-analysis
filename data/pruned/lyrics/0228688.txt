And here's the keys to the new car in the drive
And before you leave our room put on your best perfume
If you're gonna do me wrong, do it right
Oh, the next time that old phone rings, I won't answer
'Cause I don't want to be the fool I was tonight
I don't want to know the truth, I don't want to see the proof
If you're gonna do me wrong, do it right
If you're gonna break my heart all to pieces
Then just walk right out and leave me, and let's end it all tonight
Take off your wedding band when he takes you by the hand
If you're gonna do me wrong, do it right
Take off your wedding band when he takes you by the hand
If you're gonna do me wrong, then do it right
It right...You might also like
