There was a little girl I had planned to marry
This was my love, I didn't want to share it
I thought that love would make my life bright and sunny
She said she couldn`t love me 'cause I didn`t have no money

[Chorus]
So every day I have to cry some
Every day I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Every day I have to cry

[Verse 2]
I had me a girl and yes, I really loved her
Every night, well, I was thinking of her
But you can't mix love with money
'Cause if you do you`re gonna hurt somebody

[Chorus]
And every day I have to cry some
Every day I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Every day I have to cry

[Verse 3]
Now, Lord, I know that I`m just a poor man
But is it wrong to love? 'Cause I`m not a rich man
But you can`t mix love with money
'Cause every time it hurts somebody
You might also like[Chorus]
Every day I have to cry some
Every day I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
Every day I have to cry
Every day, I have to, ooh, cry some
Every day, I have to cry some
Dry the water from my eyes some
