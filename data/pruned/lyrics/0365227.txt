Set the scene and close the door-
Lights go down, and we don't make a sound
And yeah we want so much more
But nights like this are perfect for now

[Pre-Chorus]

Never gonna make it stop-
You can't make it stop
Never gonna make it stop-
You can't make it stop

[Chorus]

This is the town I used to know-
This is the school we used to own
This is the wind that used to blow-
This is the world I used to know

[Verse 2: Ryan Star]

Lying underneath the bed-
Your ceiling never felt so far away
And tomorrow when we say goodbye
We'll promise that we'll always stay the same
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]

But we're never gonna make it stop-
You can't make it stop
Never gonna make it stop-
You can't make it stop

[Chorus]

This is the town I used to know-
This is the school we used to own
This is the wind that used to blow-
This is the world I used to know-
This is the world I used to know
This is the world I used to know

[Bridge]

We wished for lots of things-
When we were seventeen
We're waiting for it now-
Waiting for it now, oh
I've got a million dreams-
There is a life I see
I'm waiting for it now-
Waiting for it now, oh
We wished for lots of things-
When we were seventeen
We're waiting for it now-
Waiting for it now, oh

This is the school we used to own-
This is the school we used to own
This is the school we used to-
This is the school we used to-
This is the school we used to own

[Outro]

This is the world I used to know-
This is the world I used to know
This is the world I used to know
This is the world we all outgrow
