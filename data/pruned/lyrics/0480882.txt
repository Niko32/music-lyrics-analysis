Get lost in a good conversation
When you gave me that look
I know where this was headed
Lets make a simple
No complications
I'm playing this by the book
So don't let me down

(Chorus)
I just can't help it cause I'm feeling this feeling this
I just can't hide it that I'm feeling it, feeling it now

(Verse 2)
Do you want my love for attention
Wasn't sure I can stop now I'm evacuating
Let me help proclaim all attention
I'll keep you out of the dark if you don't let me down

(Chorus)
I just can't help it cause I'm feeling this feeling this
I just can't hide it that I'm feeling, feeling this now

(Verse 3)
You can let me be your distraction
I can give you it all but lets have something later
This is more than just an attraction
We can see where it goes if you don't let me down
You might also like(Chorus)
I just can't help it cause I'm feeling this feeling this
I just can't hide it That I'm feeling feeling this now  (2x)
