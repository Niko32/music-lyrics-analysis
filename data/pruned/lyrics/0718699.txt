Nineteen and naive
No boy could ever, ever hurt me
It takes a man to do that
And I was calling him back
You told me you thought I was pretty
The brightest light in the city
Said forever we'd be
Well, you sure fooled me

[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa-oh, secrets, secrets are no fun
Whoa-oh, secrets, secrets hurt someone

[Chorus]
Wasn't 'til I, I fell six foot deep
'Til I found out you were married to a girl who wasn't me
Whoa-oh, you say you're so ashamed
Whoa-oh, you say forget my name
Take this with you to your grave

[Verse 2]
Late nights followed by no calls
Making sense of it all
Why my name in your phone
It was saved as unknown
Your lies finally add up
Her necklace and her makeup
It was her perfume
Sitting there in your room
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Whoa-oh, secrets, secrets are no fun
Whoa-oh, secrets, secrets hurt someone

[Chorus]
Wasn't 'til I, I fell six foot deep
'Til I found out you were married to a girl who wasn't me
Whoa-oh, you say you're so ashamed
Whoa-oh, you say forget my name
Take this with you to

[Bridge]
You don't know me very well
If you think I won't tell
Ha, well, not a chance in hell
Oh, oh
No, no
Oh, oh
No, no

[Chorus]
Wasn't 'til I, I fell six foot deep
'Til I found out you were married to a girl who wasn't me
Whoa-oh, you say you're so ashamed
Whoa-oh, you say forget my name
Take this with you to
Oh, take this with you to your grave
