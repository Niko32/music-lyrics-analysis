Here's an Ode, ah, to deodorant
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene
It keeps me through the day
Another ode, ah to deodorant
It's my thing, ah it's my favourite hygiene
It's the confidence I need

[Chorus]
It's medicine for the soul
It's medicine for the mind
It picks me up and makes me whole
It makes me feel alright

[Verse 2]
Here's an Ode, an ode to aerosol
It's my thing
Ah, it's my favourite hygiene, it's the confidence I need

[Chorus]
It's medicine for the soul
It's medicine for the mind
It picks me up and makes me whole
It makes me feel alright

[Outro]
It's okay, oh, would I ever let you down, no way
Oh, would I ever let you down, okay?
Oh, would I ever let you down, no way
Oh, would I ever let you down
I'll never let you, I'll never let you, I'll never let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no way
Would I ever let you let you down, no wayYou might also like
