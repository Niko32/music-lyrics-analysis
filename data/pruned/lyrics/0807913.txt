Once I had a secret love
That lived within the heart of me
All too soon my secret love
He became impatient to be free

[Verse 2: Marvin Gaye]
So I told a friendly star
The way that dreamers often do
Just how wonderful you are
And why I'm so in love with you

[Verse 3: Marvin Gaye & Kim Weston]
Now I shout it from the highest hill
Even told the golden daffodil
At last my heart's an open door
My secret love's no secret anymore

[Outro: Marvin Gaye & Kim Weston]
You're my secret loveYou might also like
