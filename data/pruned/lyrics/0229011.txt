Jesus saves today
When you feel you've reached the end
And you can't find a friend
Jesus saves today
Now some people think that Jesus was just a prophet
And if I ended on the cross that's where He died
But I believe He was the true son of our father
Deep in my heart I feel him living inside
Jesus saves today
Jesus saves today
Deny yourself, pick up the cross
If you know you are lost
'Cause Jesus saves today
I believe he stoof upon the Mount of Olive
For us all to turn from all our sinful ways
And Simon Peter saw Him walkin' upon the water
And I believe He's walking with us still today
Jesus saves today
Jesus saves today
Deny yourself, pick up your cross
If you know that you are lost
'Cause Jesus saves today
Now, Jesus saves today
