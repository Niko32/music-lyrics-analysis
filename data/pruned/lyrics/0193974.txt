I'm a blue collar man, had a hammer in my hand
For the last few years of my life
Workin' a double overtime while you sleep alone at night
Baby, I know it's been a long hard ride

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Sometimes I forget to say "I love you"
But, baby, please know that I do, yeah

[Chorus]
I live this life everyday, I make my share of mistakes
And every lesson I've learned, I've learned the hard way
I do the best that I can and I hope you understand
After all, I'm just a man

[Verse 2]
I found a postcard that you saved, it's turned yellow with age
Of a beautiful place in the sun
We've been sayin' every year that we're gonna go there
And run away, just the two of us

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Well, I put that picture back on your dresser
Grab my keys, I gotta get back to work, yeah
You might also like[Chorus]
I live this life everyday, I make my share of mistakes
And every lesson I've learned, I've learned the hard way
I do the best that I can and I hope you understand
After all, I'm just a man

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I live this life everyday, I make my share of mistakes
And every lesson I've learned, I've learned the hard way
I do the best that I can and I hope you understand
After all, I'm just a man
After all, I'm just a man

[Outro]
That's all I am
Baby, I'm just a man
Mmm-hmm
