It's only 11 somethin', but why does it feel like its 2 somethin'?
We just vibin', we just cruisin', baby (baby)
Forever me and you, 'cause I'm losing track of time
And I hope I'm not wasting my time, my time, my time, my time

[Verse 1]
Weed, I don't smoke that
But for you I'll do anything so let's roll that, baby
It's me and you in this room, ain't no telling what we're gonna do
Baby we're floating on clouds, shutting the whole world out
I feel like we're losing track of time that's why I say

[Chorus]
It's only 11 somethin', but why does it feel like its 2 somethin'?
We just vibin', we just cruisin' baby (baby)
Forever me and you, 'cause I'm losing track of time
And I hope I'm not wasting my time, my time, my time, my time

[Verse 2]
You, got me tripping feel like I can do anything when you're with me, baby
You got me feeling some type of way (of way)
(And I ain't felt like this for nobody else)
Baby we're floating on clouds, shutting the whole world out
It's crazy how time keeps passing by but it feels just like we're standing still
You might also like[Chorus]
It's only 11 somethin', but why does it feel like its 2 somethin'?
We just vibin', we just cruisin' baby (baby)
Forever me and you, 'cause I'm losing track of time
And I hope I'm not wasting my time, my time, my time, my time

[Outro]
My time
My, time
