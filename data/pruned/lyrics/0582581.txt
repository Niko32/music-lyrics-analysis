When sheep and moles
Are lions or horse
Are found then lost
And the cycle goes
When the smartest are those
Who speak the most
Thus killing the dose
Dose of air you'll need
When the barking is done
Sure it is still on
When the leader is gone
Got to leave them a bone
Let them feel on a throne
Let's forget this song, cause I…

[Chorus]
I just wanna fly
Like eagles in the sky
I really wanna get those wings
Spread them up and fly so high
I just wanna fly
Like an eagle in the sky
I really wanna get those wings
But still I cry like a butterfly
You might also like[Verse 1]
Everything is messed up and
Everything is too goddamn cold
Everybody wants a piece of you
You ain't a cake so go stay strong
True love is losing its meaning
I ain't right... then prove that I am wrong
I just got a feeling that I...
I don't wanna live on this planet anymore

[Chorus]
[Verse 2]
They take your kindness for weakness
Nonetheless, I keep up that weakness
Nowadays silence is what I want
Improve it up or just don't talk
I counter the wind
While them blown away
When the clouds so gone
I am miles away
Google it up for me
I'll be on my way
Multiply by nine light years by the way

[Bridge]
I just wanna fly high
Like them eagles sky high
Come and take your challenge if no tears will drop when you cry
I just wanna fly high
Like them eagles sky high
Come and take your challenge if no tears will drop when you cry
When you cry…
When! You! Cry…
When you cry…
[Chorus]
[Verse 1]
[Chorus Fade out]
