I'm living on a lonely island
In a loveless ocean full of misery
I'll die here, on my lonely island
Unless you give your sweet love back to me

[Verse]
I can't seem to take it
I'm blue as I can be
I'm blind to any other lover's charm

[Verse]
I know I can make it
Without your love for me
I've got to have you back here in my arms

[Chorus]
I'm living on a lonely island
In a loveless ocean full of misery
I'll die here, on my lonely island
Unless you give your sweet love back to meYou might also like
