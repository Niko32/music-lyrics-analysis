Land in Spain
Then I took a bus and I took a train
Got down South
Met this man
Mario the guitar in his hand
He don't like music
From the U.S
Bite his nails
Practice scales
Metronome plays all night and day
I go out for tea and the flamenco came

But go
Well it's always night
Well it's always night
Yeah I'll go to Rome
Rooftop slums
Dead beneath pipes and gypsy drums
Shade of my cash and drop my class
Rent out a piano behind stained glass

And go
Well it's always night
Green laser light
You might also likeDown streets say they're selling hash
Just make em grass

Robbery yeah they're selling out fast
Old folks say that they're safe as day
Were the fascist ones
Yeah but I don't know

Well I got the money but the money got me
It was all the same in Spain
Well you loved me but you still lost me
Treated me such away-ay-ay
I'll make the money but the money made me
It was all the same in spain
Well I bought the drugs and the drugs bought me
It's no running away-ay-ay

Discotheques don't start till 3
So I'll mess with the ? in the alpine streets
- She's said I always used to be so clean
Love's no fun
Say what d'ya mean
- She was looting me without looting herself
Getting me bored with the things she felt
Said this music sucks
I'm down on my luck
Can't get no sleep
And then load the trucks
So Monday
Tuesday
Friday
Yeah 3 o'clock rolled around
So we went downtown
- Hit the stall but we only play underground
I walked in and I just hit the ceiling
Everyone here's in love with the feeling
Go
Live a life at night
Oh a life of might
And so
I know the motto goes

I will know when I see it

I got the money but the money got me
It was all the same in spain
Well you loved me but you still lost me
Cheated me such away-ay-ay
I'll make the money but the money made me
It was all the same in spain
Well I bought the drugs and the drugs bought me
It's no running away-ay-ay

Well it's just my life
Cause the time was right
It was so much fun
With a clean cut job
With the hire cops
Knew my day would come
Oh please
Don't convince me
Already see
It's just my life
Cause the time was right
And it was so much fun
I wanna go home
A 29 year old
Next patriot from
America's South
In light of the background
The queen of the designer crowds
Must have been the only time
She got turned on
Ha

I got the money but the money got me
It was all the same in spain
Well you loved me but you still lost me
Cheated me such away-ay-ay
I'll make the money but the money made me
It was all the same in spain
Well I bought the drugs and the drugs bought me
It's no running away-ay-ay

I messed up
My life
Cause the time was right
- It was so much fun
- It was a clean cut job
With the hire cops
Knew my day would come
Oh even please
Don't convince me
You know I already see
Cause the time was right
And it was so much fun
Cause the time was right
It was so much fun
- It was a clean cut job
- With the hire cops
Knew my day would come
Oh even please
Don't convince me
You know I already
