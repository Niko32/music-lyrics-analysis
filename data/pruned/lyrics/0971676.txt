Won't look back anyway
I'll never be the angel, you see in your dreams
Oh, give me some wheels, if I can't have wings

We live in a world that suits you well
But it feels like a cage to me
And the pedestal you tried to put me on
Just slipped out from under my feet

Oh, give me some wheels, put me on a highway
Won't look back anyway
I'll never be the ange,l you see in your dreams
Oh, give me some wheels, if I can't have wings
Give me some wheels

You never knew me anyway
I just couldn't make you see
While you were looking
For the words to make me stay
I was looking for the keys

Oh, give me some wheels, put me on a highway
Won't look back anyway
I'll never be the angel, you see in your dreams
Oh, give me some wheels, if I can't have wings
Give me some wheels
You might also likeI couldn't love you any better than that
But you never seemed satisfied
What I'm trying to say is
I need a man who don't mind letting me drive

Oh, give me some wheels, put me on a highway
Won't look back anyway
I'll never be your angel, whatever that means
Oh, give me some wheels, if I can't have wings
Give me some wheels

Oh, give me some wheels
Give me some wheels...
