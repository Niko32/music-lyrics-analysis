Lazy yellow moon comin' up tonight
Shinin' through the trees
Crickets are singin' and lightning bugs
Are floatin' on the breeze
Baby get ready
Across the field where the creek turns back by the ol' stump in the road
I'm gonna take you to a special place that nobody knows
Baby get ready...ooooh ooooh

[Chorus:]
You and me going fishin' in the dark
Lying on our backs and counting the starts
Where the cool grass grows
Down by the river in the full moonlight
We'll be fallin' in love in the middle of the night
Just movin' slow
Staying the whole night through, feels so good to be with you

[Verse 2:]
Spring is almost over and summer's come
And the days are gettin' long
Waited all winter for the time to be right, just take you along
Baby get ready
And it don't matter if we sit forever and the fish don't bite
Jump in the river and cool ourselves from the heat of the night
Baby get ready...ooooh ooooh
You might also like[Chorus]
