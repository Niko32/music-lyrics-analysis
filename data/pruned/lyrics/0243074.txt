A-Yo Turn It Up I hate this awkward atmosphere
Was the clock's needle always this loud?
I only hear the sound of saliva going down my throat. What should I say?
Look baby, I only want to greet the morning with you
Before this night passes, our own secret party
But you like Cinderella want to go home when the clock hits 12
Lonely nights are long, callin' up your parents
I act strong but it bothers me, S.O.S there's no progress
Oh wait a second why am I like this? Am I drunk, I'm getting dizzy, I'm falling asleep

In the smooth sounds of music, an armful of red roses Ooh~

You're going home tomorrow anyway, It's late it might be dangerous dear
No there's no other meaning, I'm just worried about you, Yeah what if someone kidnaps you
This long long night night, a party of enchanting stars
Nothing can stop this, This feeling of becoming one, Stop right there

Baby take my hand, Don't be afraid me, Just stay together

It's the first time since I've met you, your family is strict so I'm scared but excited
Phone on vibrate, a bad sign, Bell goes ding dong, a signal to escape bingo
I need to give her assurance, so I can convince her with a believable excuse
The prettiest fiance in the world, with you on that green field
I'm usually wild, but I'm soft. I can't say anything I can't take responsibility for
Girl you know what I mean, it's hard to explain this, but these are needless words
Dim the lights, our eyes meet
And slightly open those tightly shut buttons, mouth dries, and lock the door

Ah~ ah~ in this night where everyone has fallen asleep, I hate being alone
Ah~ ooh~ ah~ hiding in that moonlight, I whisper sweet nothings
