Walking home
In my sight
Caught the hate
Turn away
Can't deny
Written on the wall
And I thought
To myself
What could change
How'd it start
Who are they
How can I
Make 'em take a fall

So far to go
Barely made a dent
Won't turn around
Not going back again

Every day
Money flows
Status Quo
Cities die
While they thrive
Zero Sum
Just the way it goes
Now's the time
You & I
Gotta try
To unite
Every side
Gotta fight
Gotta turn the flow
