Love me, love me, say you do
Let me fly away with you
For my love is like the wind
And wild is the wind

[Verse 2]
Give me more than one grasp
To satisfy this hungriness
Let the wind blow through your heart
And wild is the wind

[Bridge]
You touch me
And I hear the sounds of mandolins
You kiss me
With your kiss my life begins
You're spring to me
All things to me
You're life itself

[Verse 3]
Like a leaf clings to a tree
Oh my darling, cling to me
For we're creatures of the wind
And wild is the wind
You might also like[Outro]
And wild is the wind
And wild is the wind
