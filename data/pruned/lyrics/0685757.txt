Won't you come home, Bill Bailey, won't you come home?
I moan the whole night long
I'll do the cooking, honey, I'll pay the rent
I know that I've done you wrong
Remember that rainy eve that I drove you out
With nothing but a fine tooth comb
Yes, I know that I'm to blame and ain't that a shame
Bill Bailey, won't you please come home?

[Outro]
Come home, come home, Bill Bailey
Bill Bailey, won't you please come on home?[x2]You might also like
