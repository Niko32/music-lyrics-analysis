I'm glad I've got skin, I'm glad I've got eyes
I'm glad I got hips, I'm glad I've got thighs
I'm glad I'm allowed to say the things I feel
I'm glad I got hair, I'm glad I got ears
I'm glad I got lungs, I'm glad I got tears
I'm glad that I never ever know what's real

[Chorus 1]
I'm glad I got lost
I'm glad I'm confused
I'm glad I don't know, what I like
I'm glad I got stoned
I'm glad I got high
I'm glad I found out I'm alright

[Verse 2]
I'm glad when the sex is not so great
I'm glad that I doubt, I know what they say
I'm glad when I get my girlfriends' names confused
I'm glad I know how my life will end
I'm glad I don't have no common sense
I'm glad the things are wrong I thought I knew

[Chorus 2]
I'm glad I'm a mess
I'm glad you don't mind
I'm glad that you're better than me
I'm glad that I changed
I'm glad I'm not nice
I'm glad it's the way, it must be
You might also like[Outro]
I'm glad I can't see beyond myself
I'm glad when the conversation ends
It's good when it's bad, I'm glad it's not
Worrying me
