Built towers of dreams just to live carefree, oh nah, baby
We knew it wouldn't last, but we kept hope as our lead
We stood right through breeze, we screamed out c'est la vie

'Cause we built castles
Castles made of sand, oh
'Cause we built castles
Castles made of sand

Please don't let it fall
Fall, fall, fall
Please don't let it fall
Fall, fall, fall
Please don't let it fall
Fall, fall, fall (fall, fall, fall)
Please don't let it fall
Fall, fall, fall (fall, fall, fall)

Too close to the sea, the waves almost took me, nah
Held each grain to me, the tide wouldn't take my peace

'Cause we built castles
Castles made of sand, oh
'Cause we built castles
Castles made of sand
'Cause we built castles
Castles made of sand
'Cause we built castles
Castles made of sand

It's not much, but it's ours
Standing on our love
We're standing on our love
