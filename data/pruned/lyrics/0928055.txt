And now you try to breathe - But your lungs keep choking on smoke and broken teeth
And now you try to hear - But those voices inside your head fill your ears
And now you try to scream - But you can't wake up from this awful dream

It's like Nightmares live in people (too many suffering)
Manifesting evil (too many lies)

You try to see- But you don't know how! You don't know how!
Now you try to breathe- But there's nothing left! Just one less breath!
Now you try to smile- But it's been such a long while you don't remember how
And now you try to scream- But you can't wake up from this awful dream

It's like Nightmares live in people (too many suffering)
Manifesting evil (too many lies)

Try to think for yourself, try to think for yourself
Can't you see that we are broken?
Tried to be someone, you tried to be someone else
Too bad you're out of time now

You're tragedy
Ring in the dead
So sad to see

Leave em for dead
Put 'em to bed
Bury 'em red
The dead are walking

The blind-
The blind leading the blind

The blind-
The blind leading the blind

Nightmares live in people

Too many lies-
Try to think for yourself, try to think for yourself
Can't you see that we are broken?
Try to be someone, you try to be someone else
Too bad you're out of time now

You're Tragedy
Ring in the dead
So sad to see
