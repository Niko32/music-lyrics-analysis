Well, all around town my name is mud
But I can't help it ’cause it's in my blood
I make it no secret, it's so plain to see
I'll jump on anything that's lookin' good to me

[Chorus]
I can't quit it (can't quit it)
I can't quit it (can't quit it)
’Cause it comes to me naturally

[Verse 2]
I like this one over here and I like that one over there
Bring me a dozen, boy, I just don't care
And when I'm finished and I'm all out of breath
Bring me another who can love me to death

[Chorus]

[Bridge 1]
Open the door and I will walk right in
There's so much to do and so little time
Lovin' you is all I'm dreamin' of
I'm tellin' the truth; I ain't got no time to lie

[Verse 3]
Well, I spend my love around the neighborhood
No need to ask me ’cause it's understood
It's just my style [?] one more thing
Give me your number, no, I'll give you a ring
You might also like[Chorus]

[Bridge 2]
Open the door so I can stroll right in
There's so much to do and so little time
Lovin' you is all I'm dreamin' of
I'm tellin' the truth; I ain't got no time to lie

[Verse 4]
I like this one over here and I like that one over there
Bring me a dozen, boy, I just don't care
And when I'm finished and I'm all out of breath
Well, bring me a honey, I can love him to death

[Chorus] x
