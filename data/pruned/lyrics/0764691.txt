Sold a penny to the railroad
Nothing gained and nothing lost
Kept it underneath the pillow
And sent it out to you for your thoughts
Sold a penny to the railroad
Nothing gained and nothing lost
Kept it underneath the pillow
And sent it out to you for your thoughts

[Hook]
Will you hold it close to your heart?
Or will you lose it the same day?
Will you throw it in the well
To gently wish me away?
Away

[Chorus]
Sold a penny to the railroad
Nothing gained and nothing lost
Kept it underneath the pillow
And sent it out to you for your thoughts

[Hook]
Will you hold it close to your heart?
Or will you lose it the same day?
Will you throw it in the well
To gently wish me away?

Do you really want me here?
Do you really want me to stay?
Do you really want me gone?
Do you really want to wish me away?
Do you really want me here?
Do you really want me to stay?
Do you really want me gone?
Do you really want to wish me away?

[Verse 1]
The television glow will keep you
Safe and warm when you're alone
And you won't be frightened by
Ghosts of birds that fly around the room
And terrorize you flying
Flying

[Refrain]
I'm wide awake now
You're sound asleep now
I'm wide awake now
You're sound asleep now
I'm wide awake now
You're sound asleep now
I'm wide awake now
You're sound asleep now
[Verse 2]
And these Valiums are finally kicking in
I can feel it under my skin
I can feel your breath on my breath
I can feel your heart on my arm
I can see the glow in the room
I can see the hummingbird fly away

[Verse 3]
I'm wide awake now
I'm wide awake now
I can feel your weight in my arms
I can feel this weight on my heart
Do you really want me to stay?
Do you really want me to go away?

[Outro]
I'm wide awake now
You're sound asleep now
I'm wide awake now
You're sound asleep now
I'm wide awake now
You're sound asleep now
I'm wide awake now
You're sound asleep now
I'm wide awake now
You're sound asleep now
