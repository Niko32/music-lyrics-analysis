You make me promises that you don't keep
Tears are expensive, honey, words are cheap
You tell me one thing, then do something else
And even though I know that all too well
I keep forgiving, I keep forgetting
I keep expecting you to change

[Chorus]
You say you will
You say you will
You say you will
But you never do

[Verse 2]
Love doesn't come with any guarantees
It's give and take a little, that's the key
So I give you every little thing you choose
You give me back a stack of I.O.U's
There seems to be a pattern here
How can I tell if you're sincere?

You say you will
You say you will, every time
You say you will
But you never do
You might also like[Bridge]
Mmm, I keep forgiving, I keep forgetting
I keep expecting you to change

[Chorus]
You say you will
You say you will, every time
You say you will
But you never do

[Chorus]
You say you will
You say you will, you make it sound so sweet
You say you will
But you never do
