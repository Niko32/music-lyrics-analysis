Don't cry my baby, just give me a smile
Seen my daddy die in the war
Seen my mamma die cryin' for
A ring a, a ring a, but I've got to sing
A ring a, a ring a, but I've got to sing
They call me a hound-dog
They call me a swine
It's all because of my colour
For their war though I'm fine
A ring a, a ring a, but I've got to sing
A ring a, a ring a, but I've got to sing

They're talkin' 'bout freedom, of religion and race
But if you're a negro they slap you in the face
A ring a, a ring a, but I've got to sing
A ring a, a ring a, but I've got to sing
So what's the use to fightin' for that sacred democracy
When the Ku Klux Klan murd'rers are going scot-free
A ring a, a ring a, but I've got to sing
A ring a, a ring a, but I've got to sing

But I'm still happy, so don't cry my babe
Together we'll strife for bein' free people some day
Oh ring, ring, so we've got to sing
Ring, ring, together we will singYou might also like
