I want you like a man loves his money
I want you like a man loves his money

[Verse 1]
What is it about you
Makes me do the things I do?
Workin' all day just to please you
Got to have you, to keep you
Time after time after time I wonder why
Havin' too much makes me wanna give it up
'Cause you tempt me, please, don't break me

[Chorus]
I want you like a man loves his money
(I want you like a man loves his money, baby)
I want you like a man loves his money
(I want you like a man loves his money)

[Verse 2]
Gotta get that cash, gotta get it fast
Hold up, wait a minute
I really love man
Time after time after time I wonder why
Not havin' enough makes me have to skig it up
Don't test me, they'll arrest me
