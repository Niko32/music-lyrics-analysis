Why you teasing me, Baby?
You won’t give me a chance
I don’t wanna stress tonight baby
So I’ll just go & dance
I’ll give you what you called for
Just let me get in your zone
I imagined you when I was with her
It’s no longer unknown

{Bridge}
And I will see everything
I will feel everything
And I’mma touch you right
And I will see everything
I will feel everything
And I’mma touch you right

(Hook)
I’mma touch you right (let this sink in slow)
I’mma touch you right (I’ll satisfy Magneto)
I’mma touch you right (just let me)

(Verse 2)
And I believe that you’ll call
And I don’t give a damn
I’ve been rejected before
You might also likeA couple steps behind. Baby
I might not be the one
But I’m right here tonight baby
You’ve been bored for too long
Oh. Oh yeah

{Bridge}

(Verse 3)
Whoa
All my feeling on the table
Might as well push them out of the way
‘Cause I still gotta Gangnam Style
I’m a huge Drake fan
They know, they know, they know
But I don't have your hot love & emotion
I should just let go
Enough Draking in my bed
No more “Best I Ever Had”, “Marvin’s Room”
“Find Your Love” or “Enough Said”
Can’t take it slow
Gotta get you away from your crew
Bring you over here with Vektor
So it’ll just be me & you
Yeayah
Yeah just me & you
I won’t talk feels, or mention love
You’ll see a side of me that’s brand new
That’s that unknown, that deep down
That V.I.C, that Papi
I’m acting like I’m not me
‘Cause nowhere is where that got me
Fell for you, didn’t really plan it
You’re way more than just physically attractive
Your mind & personality are sexy, I’m just being candid
You’ve got me going crazy; I’m acting like a manic out here
You got me all up in my zone
But I might not be here later
So you could thank me now
Aw yeah
