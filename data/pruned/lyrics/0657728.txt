Looking at you all I can say is god dam
I guess god made u on a day that he was trying he was trying &
I wanna let u know that I'm ur biggest fan
I Wanna help ur dreams come true because Baby u can
All the mistakes that I've made in past
All of the nights I was to afraid to ask
For all the times i jumped in head first to Fast
I might not b ir first but I'll b ur last
And baby that's a promise
Tell u ur beautiful   everyday with or without pajamas
Been waiting for day that u would come
I hang ur picture on my wall u Try  fix my cause I'm trouble some
Always remember tanned skin short skirts & bubble gum
The one my momma told me to Stay away from
Makes my taste numb, hottest thing under the sun
Let's me live another life so this one I can escape from

At times life's shows me that moving at a fast pace
Ur beauty shows me that I'm human when u make that sad face
Together let's say goodbye to the sad days
Chock it up to  learning lesson from a bad phase
Staring out windows filling up Ashtray
I Remember exactly the day that she asks me
Does life have to be that way
Why do They always end up leaving or cheating on me
Am I not beautiful
That's so untrue ur beauties inside out threw & threw
U just have habit of choosing  the wrong men
Even when u were with them ic u still offend pretend
U don't need to b told u should just know it
Iet me make u smile for all the times that I never showed it
Ive been know for Being to heroic
But I'll make u a love song I got a heart of a poet
