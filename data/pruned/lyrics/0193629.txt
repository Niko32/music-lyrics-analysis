I wouldn't hide this feeling
A coward's crown - please raise it high
I couldn't stop the warning
Split like a lip on top of mine

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wouldn't leave you in the sunlight
I wouldn't keep you in the sun's eye

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Keep up the lying
If there's a meaning then I'll say it all again

[Chorus]
You wouldn’t call my name
It’s never been the same
It’s true, your eyes don’t look at me
I couldn’t tell you if I knew it or not

[Post-Chorus]
It could be islands
It could be better
It could be islands
It could be better
It could be islands
It could be better
It could be islands
It could be better

Who can have this feeling?
A coward's crown - please raise it high
I could hold off in the morning
Growing bolder in the night

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I wouldn't leave you in the sunlight
I wouldn't keep you in the sun's eye

[Chorus]
You wouldn't call my name
It's never been the same
It's true, your eyes don't look at me
I couldn't tell you if I knew it or not

[Post-Chorus]
It could be islands
It could be better
It could be islands
It could be better
It could be islands
It could be better
It could be islands
It could be better
