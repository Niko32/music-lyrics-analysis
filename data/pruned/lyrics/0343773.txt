There was a terrible storm
And you were wearing all our coats
In the back of this car
I feel like I have traveled nowhere

[Verse 2]
We buried in the snow
I kept warm inside of your clothes
You swore that nothing would ever change
The way we were right then

[Pre-Chorus]
It was a colder a night
Bought a hotel I

[Chorus]
I thought you would never
Find another love again
Oh but you haven't missed a thing
No you haven't missed a thing
No you haven't missed a thing
No you haven't missed a thing

[Verse 1]
There was a terrible storm
And you were wearing all our coats
In the back of this car
I feel like I have traveled nowhere
You might also like[Verse 2]
We buried in the snow
I kept warm inside of your clothes
You swore that nothing would ever change
The way we were right then

[Pre-Chorus]
It was a colder a night
Bought a hotel I

[Chorus]
I thought you would never
Find another love again
Oh but you haven't missed a thing
No you haven't missed a thing
No you haven't missed a thing
No you haven't missed a thing
