Don't hold me down
Don't hold me down
I can't see the light
Down here on the ground
Where the living is hard
And it's due or die
Will we ever make it to see the sky
Put is in a box, throw us in a cage
One mans destruction, another mans pay
Another man is paid...

[Chorus]
I fear for tommorow, times gonna change
Body found in the gutter
This face with no name
Now you'll get devoured
In the home of the brave
First he give you a number
Now you're a face with no name

[Verse 2]
I watched you drown
Didn't make a sound
Never made a sound
In the deep end
Where the sharks swim
Where the living was hard
It was due or die
Will we ever make it to see the sky
Put 'em in a box, throw 'em in a hearse
One mans destruction, another mans worth
You might also like[Bridge]
Who will pay the price, who will be sacrificed
I won't, I put my faith in the most high
I put my faith in [?]

[Chorus]
I fear for tommorow, times gonna change
Body found in the gutter
This face with no name
Now you'll get devoured
In the home of the brave
First he give you a number
Now you're a face with no name
