Believer
Your spotlights on the subject, so incorrect
And suggestion
Suggests that I am someone who you should not respect
Oh, you wear your facade so well
Covered up in a plastic shell
You're a liar
To everyone around you, just don't forget

[Chorus]
Face the honest truth
You were never you
Now, be defiant, the lion
Give them a fight that will open their eyes
Hangman hooded, softly swinging
Don't close the coffin yet, I'm alive!

[Post-Chorus]
And it's homecoming
And it's homecoming

[Verse 2]
Can you remember
When there was no wrong in what I could do?
So young
Biting off way more than I could chew
And then one day, I grew too old
And my cares were now theirs to mold
Please accept this
As my resignation, it's time to go
You might also like[Chorus]
Face the honest truth
You were never you
Now, be defiant, the lion
Give them a fight that will open their eyes
Hangman hooded, softly swinging
Don't close the coffin yet, I'm alive!
Oh, I'm alive!

[Bridge]
I will now bleed for what I believe in
No more mistakes for them to make for me
So goodbye, it's my time to be
To be me
To be...

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Face the honest truth
You were never you
Now, be defiant, the lion
Give them a fight that will open their eyes
Hangman hooded, softly swinging
Don't close the coffin yet, I'm alive!
I'm alive!
I'm alive!
I'm alive!
