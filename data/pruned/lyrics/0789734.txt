Can't you find something else to talk about?
Is this song the only one you sing?
Makes you look better when you put things down
Who values your opinion?

[Pre-Chorus: Alexander O'Neal]
Don't criticize my friends
Criticize my ideas
Don't criticize my lifestyle
I'm fed up 'cause all you wanna do is criticize

[Chorus: Lisa Keith, Alexander O'Neal]
Don't just close your mind
Ooh, ooh (Criticize, yeah)
You don't realize (All you wanna do is criticize)
I just want what is right
Still you say
Criticize
