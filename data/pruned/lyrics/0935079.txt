A shot in the dark, took a chance
And kept on waiting for you

Another day gone and wasted
The fear of being alone
I can't take it no more

Maybe it's time that we start looking
For something different
It seems you and I have grown apart

Let it drift away if the love is gone
You gotta do what you can and just move on
Let it drift away, don't you wait too long
You gotta do what you can to just move on
When the love is gone, just move on

Step by step, tired of chasing
Over and over in circles
As my heart's racing from this

You crossed the line, no hesitating
Wearing me out like a song
That keeps playing and playing
You might also likeWe all want to live a story
With a happy ending
But luck ran out on you and I

Let it drift away if the love is gone
You gotta do what you can and just move on
Let it drift away, don't you wait too long
You gotta do what you can to just move on
When the love is gone, just move on

You don't know how it feels
To walk away and leave it
It hurts to lose a love that's real

Let it drift away if the love is gone
You gotta do what you can and just move on
Let it drift away, don't you wait too long
You gotta do what you can to just move on

Let it drift away if the love is gone
You gotta do what you can and just move on
When the love is gone, just move on
Just move on, just move on
