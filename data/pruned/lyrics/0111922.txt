I read my mother died today or maybe yesterday
I don't know cuz the telegram from the home
It told me that shes deceased the funeral is tomorrow
Expect me to feel some sorrow but I really I feel nothin'
Happiness nor depression no time to answer your question
Don't tell me what to believe in don't tell me to find religion
Sorry im not committed this mediocre commitment
And still they call me a menace, ignorant never listen
Just stop, breathe, I free fall into a pit
The epitome of abyss as im lighting my cigarette
Catching the two o'clock as im catching up with my breath
The sun is beating me down the sweat is crawling my neck
Uh! strange faces so I made myself invisible
Blind to their eyes and still I feel despicable
Still im feeling pitiful attending mothers funeral
No guilt of feeling furious no fear I feel the usual
Priest begins to preach while the angels start to sing
Angels don't exist its the sun that starts to beam
Reading from the bible index on the text
You expect me to believe god put us on a test
Please, wait, let me recollect my thoughts
I will never hold my tongue if you expect for me to fall to your beliefs
Just cease, just see what I see
If religion is the answer why we still finding peace?
Decorated lies you symbolize it with a crucifix
Strangling these ties so it time for me to loosen it
Hang me on a noose cuz im a nuisance for my foolishness
Like the scarlet letter they labeled me emotionless
My last wish I want everyone to gather
As their staring at my grave look deep to find the answer
And illuminate the candles, love was never painful
Cuz its lust that I desire watch em burning in the fire I'm the stranger!You might also like
