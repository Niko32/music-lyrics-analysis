[Chorus]

I said fuck y'all don't know shit me
Fuck y'all, fck y'all

Pen to the paper burn tracks like these niggas burn trees
Fuck all y'all fck all y'all

Y'all fuck niggas don't know shit about me

Spit on my name, throw dirt, still coming out clean
Fuck y'all fuck y'all

Fuck y'all, y'all don't know shit about me
Young Dena kid, all I got is a diploma and dream
That's Debt and a scheme

Y'all fuck niggas don't know shit about me
From the land of lost souls, lost kids, lost roads, lost dreams

What path will i lead?


[ J.Hurt Verse 1 ]
You might also likeMy cup runneth , flow over flow
If I ghost wrote , I would be the Holy Ghost
Fuck the false prophets and they mosh pits, Posh whips
Making false profit like they pure but they toxic
Toxins, boxed in, ima stand out
Started from the bottom, how the fuck we getting handouts?
One side was slaves, and the other side was conquered
Hence Hurtado , I'm a product of this monster
Fuck your blog, fuck your post, fuck your sponsors
Fuck your Instagram, fuck your twitter, fuck your concert
This a concerted effort I'm sever y'all
Break the chains, call me what I want, but I'm never y'all
I'm the truth
So gon head, grab a Glock, load shoot
What I drop from the booth
Out last any life span
So throw your shots , throw your spite man
You can't kill like my mic can

[Chorus]

[J.Hurt Verse 2]

This the new epidemic this the new crack
What I make? I'm a chemist , I'm a new jack
So Throw salt on the room, cuz crew wack
Sleep on us, You sleep on the 211s like its 2 jacks
Better crack the code bitch
Flow like ice in your colon that's some cold shit
Could've been a dealer on the corner doing cold shit
Went a different route became a lonar back in 06'
You don't know shit about me
Fuck the system lockin up every kid around me
Obscenity, The Clarity, we in the round 3
That's Regression my nigga, see all this sin around me
Slave to the corporates
Make a poor kid wanna forfeit
Sell his soul for the quick fortunes
And Get locked in a fortress
I'm speaking for the people that society aborted
These forces
[Chorus]

[J.Hurt verse 3]

Bitch you don't know shit about shit talking shit
Fall back
This the real
That's a fact
All these people talking talk
Behind my back
Know shit about jack
210 and beyond, like 2 jacks
2 11th cards played
Steal the game like hacks
Get the monkey up off my back
This is more than just rap
