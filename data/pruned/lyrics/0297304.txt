Something you said to me
But I can't explain it
Something you said to me
I, I know you've asked it
Somehow you found me
The words are in motion
Somehow you found me
The words are in motion now

[Verse 1]
I, I got locked in myself
And I don't know what to do
There were dreams in my eyes
That now - Don't shine through

[Hook]
Something you said to me
I, I can't explain it
Something you said to me
I, I know you've asked it
Somehow you found me
The words are in motion
Somehow you found me
The words are in motion now

I'm beginning to feel that
You don't know what you do
Is it possibly true that motions
Get lost on you?
Get lost on you

[Bridge]
And you never grow up
And you never did see
The world's coming down
Was crashing right upon me
Upon me
And everyone knows
That you never go back
Cause you never did see
Cause we never attack
Forget me
I'll forget you

[Hook]
Something you said to me
I, I can't explain it
Something you said to me
I, I know you've asked it
Somehow you found me
The words are in motion
Somehow you found me
The words are in motion now
