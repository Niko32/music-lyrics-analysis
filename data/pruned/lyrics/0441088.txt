Don’t forget to tell yourself
Look inside of you and no one else
No one even cares about your health
Just ask my mom she’s doing well

Come inside and have a drink
I don’t even know, I just can’t think
I just ask myself if mom did wrong
If you say nothing you best get gone
Get get gone

Chorus

Well pa-pa-papa said go on out and be something
And my-my mama said stay home and be nothing
It made it hard to get going
I told myself I was going strong
Mama said I ain’t got no home
Get get gone

Verse 2

Well stay outside and don’t forget your slippers
Up in the night sky you can’t see the big dipper
The time has come for you to make a change
Go on out until they know your name

I told myself I was going strong
Mama said I ain’t got no home

Break beats

Chorus

Well pa-pa-papa said go on out and be something
And my-my mama said stay home and be nothing
It made it hard to get going
I told myself I was going strong
Mama said I ain’t got no home
