You'll come in with the sun in the mornin'
Like you've done so often before
But you won't find me asleep on the sofa
Exhausted from walkin' the floor

[Chorus]
'Cause while you were leadin' somebody on
My heart was slippin' away
'Cause while you were leadin' somebody on
Somebody led me away

[Verse 2]
And this time the note on your pillow
Will go one line more than "I'm through"
For the guilt I'm feeling this time over leaving
Is that it's so easy to do

[Chorus]
'Cause while you were leadin' somebody on
My heart was slippin' away
'Cause while you were leadin' somebody on
Somebody led me awayYou might also like
