I can't dance and I never could, I guess my feet don't match
I've been thinkin' 'bout dancin' with you
But I'm afraid of hurtin' my back
I don't know what you're doin' but I like everything you do
Just for a little bit baby, I'd come out and dance with you

[Chorus:]
But I can't dance and I'm feelin' so good
Some of us can and some of us can't
And some of us wish that we could dance
Some can't dance and I guess I'm just one of the unfortunate few
Just for a little bit, baby, I'd come out and dance with you

[Verse 2:]
My mind is out there with you now but I can't get my body to move
Sittin' here fallin' in love, love, love thinkin' somethin' I can't prove
My soul is willin' and my mind is ready
But it's somethin' that I never could do
Just for a little bit baby, I'd come out and dance with you
