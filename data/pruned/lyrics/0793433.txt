If this is how it feels to give then I don't want to be around you
See if I come there running
To break your fall, your falling into pieces, doesn't have to be like this
But weary eyes, let me know that you won't change
Change your believing, 'cause you're not seeing

I can't hold your hand
I can't fight your war

See if I come there running
Where did we, how did we go wrong, when did we get so strong
Watch me hold, hold my hands out for you to take
All you ever wanted was another handout
But teary eyes let me know that you can change
Change your believing, now that you are seeingYou might also like
