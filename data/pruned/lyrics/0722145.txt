Here we go
Ooh, hey, hey
Hey
5000

[Verse 1]
Say, lady, can I ask you why you’re treating me
Like a stepchild with a future not so bright?
I thought you said you would never be that way to me
You said you'd never leave me for the rest of my life
And I believed you all the times you said to me
"Baby, you’re always on my mind"
I don't believe you, so save the words you said to me
And I'll be on my way, I've got to say goodbye, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
You didn't want my love
(You didn't want my love)
That's what starts the pain
(That's what starts the pain, baby)
You didn't need my love
(You didn't need my love)
I think that's your game
(Oh, whoa, whoa)
You might also like[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye
(You'd never be that way to me)
Goodbye, goodbye
(Oh, oh, whoa)
I've got a love that you will never see, yeah (Hey)

[Verse 2]
I guess you thought you had me strung out on your love
Simply because you are so fine
It takes more than looks to steal my heart away from me
So I'm sorry, baby, the joke's on you this time, baby

[Pre-Chorus]
You didn't want my love
(You didn't want my love)
That's what starts the pain
(That's what starts the pain, baby)
You didn't need my love
(You didn't need my love)
I think that's your game
(Oh, baby)

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye
(I've got to say goodbye, yeah)
Goodbye, goodbye
(I love you but I've got to say goodbye)
I've got a love that you will never see, baby
[Bridge]
Here we go (Hey)
Oh baby, oh, oh
I'm on a rampage (Hey)
'Cause this is my stage
'Cause I'm the T to the E to the V to the I to the N
(That's what starts—) Here we go

[Chorus]
Goodbye, goodbye
(I've got to say goodbye, yeah, baby)
Goodbye, goodbye
(Goodbye, you'd never be that way, I said never be that way to me again)
Goodbye, goodbye
(Oh baby, I've got to say goodbye to you, right now, baby, yeah)
Goodbye, goodbye
(Say goodbye to you, goodbye)
I've got a love that you will never see, yeah

[Outro]
That's what starts the pain
Oh-whoa-whoa, ooh-whoa, baby, oh
Haha
