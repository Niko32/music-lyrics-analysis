This thing that they call time
But it just slips away from me
Whenever you are next to me, yeah-yeah
Now the reasonable doubt, yeah
(Reasonable doubt, yeah)
Of how i feel inside
But I can't help this feeling
This small and simple feeling

The world is calling me but

And it's just you and me
I want you (yeah)

You're my favorite girl you know it's true
