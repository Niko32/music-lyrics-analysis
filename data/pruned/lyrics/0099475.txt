Bitch I'm Marty McFly, swagger futuristic
I'm superstitious, won't sit inside a coupe unless the roof is missing
To tell the truth these groupie bitches never knew the difference
Between a princess cut or cubic on my crucifixes
I'm smoking Cubans in Aruba barracuda fishing
Talkin' to jewelers about my Mueller, that's my new edition
Got bitches cookin' for me that ain't never used a kitchen
Might fuck 'em in a few positions, but refuse to kiss em'
It's kind of humorous your music even drew attention
You couldn't piss inside a fuckin' pot I used to piss in
Dawg you on that +chuck-e-cheese+, me I got a +swiss+ account
You the type of bitch nigga, bitches always bitch about
7 series beamer leaning, listening to swisha house
Got a bitch that does the dishes with a swisha in her mouth
Hottest nigga in the south, you gone have to wait your turn
Cause' if you niggas ballin' I guess you can call me David Stern

[Hook: Novaking]

I just thought that you should know
I ain't like them niggas that you used to know
Got a bunch of bitches on my dick
But I won't slip, no not for no bitch 'cause I'm on my shit
Cause' I'm so fly, you should call me Mr. Marty McFly
You should call me Marty McFly
You could catch me off in the sky
You should call me Marty McFly

White cup, codeine in it, bad broads you know we in it
Then I hit the boulevard hard, drink it all up til there ain't none in it
Smokin' Cubans & dodging groupies, don't like it sue me
Then I tell her strap in , ride me like a dually make a movie
Take it all off baby let me see it
She got them foreign features think my bitch is European
Plus it's cheaper to leave her
What I look like with a silly hoe all in my pockets & my visa

[Verse 3: Epidemic]

I'm a limelight stealer, the visa up in Ibiza
This the vida, diva juggling, guzzle double tequilas
& I'm the leader, got game by the liter might splash it on your bitch
Even grab her by her wrist when I meet her
Bitch I'm grain grippin', lane to lane switchin'
With the paint drippin' off the frame, getting brains
Fuckin' the same bitches that you claim that are faithful
This is painful, I paint pictures with the same flow
Nigga this is game over
