Why do I cry?
Why do I sigh
When I know
Ah, when I know deep down inside
What you told me
Was just another lie?

[Verse 2]
Every day
I get the blues
I get those bad kind of blues
I just can't lose
What you told me
Was just another lie

[Chorus]
I should know better by now
I shouldn't trust you like I do
But when you roll those great big eyes
You're just like an angel out of the blue

[Verse 1]
So why do I cry?
Why do I sigh
When I know, when I know
Deep down inside
What you told me
Was just another lie?

[Chorus]
I should know better by now
I shouldn't trust you like I do
But, honey, when you roll, when your roll those great big eyes
You're just like an angel out of the blue

[Verse 1]
Oh, why do I cry?
Why do I sigh
When I know
Deep down inside
What you told me
Was just another lie?
