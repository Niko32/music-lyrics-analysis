Wanting me to be one more mistake to make
A bridge to burn to get to someone knew
Hey, pass me by if you're only passing through

You sure look like the traveling kind to me
Don't stop if this ain't where you want to be
Now I don't know what you think you've run into
Hey, pass me by if you're only passing through

[Instrumental]

I'm not gonna be your stepping stone
Among the other hearts that you've walked on
Lord, help me if I fall in love with you
Hey, pass me by if you're only passing through

You sure look like the traveling kind to me
Don't stop if this ain't where you want to be
Now I don't know what you think you've run into
Hey, pass me by if you're only passing through

Pass me by if you're only passing through...You might also like
