Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, thanks for nothing

[Verse 1]
You shouldn't have, oh you didn't
You're so generous. thanks for nothing
Never mind all the stuff I bought for you
It was my pleasure getting nothing back
Come next year I'm getting you exactly what you got me
Fucking nothing, see how you like it

[Chorus 1]
I don't have much money but I got you something nice
I maxed out my cards, didn't care about the price
To show I care this time of year
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, thanks for nothing

[Verse 2]
So I'm a sap under the Christmas tree
Trying to find the gifts I thought you got for me
But there was nothing there, what a shock
Just the torn-up Christmas wrappings from all the gifts I bought

[Chorus 2]
Thanks for all the effort to brighten up my Christmas
Thank you for the knife that you stabbed me in the back with
What a blessing, you're really something
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, thanks for nothing
You might also like[Verse 3]
I've been so selfless, choosing gifts so thoughtfully
Sweating in a crowed mall and you don't get shit for me
You selfish asshole. I hope you die
Choking on your putrid pile of presents six feet high

[Chorus 3]
Thanks for making Christmas such a disappointment
Thanks for making sharing seem so fucking pointless
What a pal, I'll tell you one thing
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, thanks for nothing

[Outro]
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, thanks for nothing
Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Fuck you
