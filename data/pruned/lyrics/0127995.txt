It must've been a mountain standin' in our way
Or some small misunderstandin', we talked about too late
Was it the kitchen or the bedroom, where we let a good thing go
Was it destined dreams, or space we needed? Oh, I don't know

[Chorus]
Baby, lately my memory, ain't what it used to be at all
It's crazy, but holdin' you close to me, seein' you smile at me is all that I recall
'Cause, baby, it don't matter how hard I try
I still can't remember why we said goodbye

[Verse 2]
Maybe time's just playin' tricks on me these days
Or maybe these old feelin's never went away
'Cause all that I remember is I'm still in love with you
And if I'm losin' my mind, I hope you are too

[Chorus]
Baby, lately my memory, ain't what it used to be at all
It's crazy, but holdin' you close to me, seein' you smile at me is all that I recall
'Cause, baby, it don't matter how hard I try
I still can't remember why we said goodbye

[Outro]
It's crazy, but holdin' you close to me, seein' you smile at me is all that I recall
'Cause, baby, it don't matter how hard I try
I still can't remember why we said goodbye
Why we said goodbye
Why did we say goodbye?You might also like
