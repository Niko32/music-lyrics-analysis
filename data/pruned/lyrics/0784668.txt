I'm rolling along, yes rolling along
I'm quitting the blues of the world
I'm singing a song, yes singing a song
"Glory Hallelujah," I just told the Parson
"Hey, Par get ready to call"
Just like Humpty Dumpty, I'm going to fall
I'm sitting on top of the world
I'm rolling along, rolling along

Don't want any millions
I'm getting my share
I've only got one suit, just one
That's all I can wear
A bundle of money
Don't make me feel gay
A sweet little honey
Is making me say

And I'm sitting, sitting on top, top of the world
I'm rolling along, rolling along
And I'm quitting, quitting the blues, blues of the world
I'm singing a song, yes singing a song
"Glory Hallelujah," I just told the Parson
"Hey, Par get ready to call"
Just like Humpty Dumpty, I'm going to fall, yeah
And I'm sitting, sitting on top, top of the world
I'm rolling along, rolling alongYou might also like
