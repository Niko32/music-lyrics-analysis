An angel kissed my strings
While I slept last night
And her rhythm broke my hunger
And I died a little less

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I just want to get some
Get some while I'm still tall
Oh, let's tell the world we're unheard
We're unsure, we're unstop-, we're unstoppable

[Chorus]
Oh, let's tell the girls to be strong
To be sure, to be heard
We want to be heard and you're all
You're all I want, yeah, all I want
So tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, where have you been?

[Verse 2]
Well, an angel kissed my hands
While I slept last night
And when I woke up this morning
God, I missed you something fierce
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I just want to get some
Get some while I'm still tall
Oh, let's tell the world we're unheard
We're unsure, we're unstop-, we're unstoppable

[Chorus]
Oh, let's tell the girls to be strong
To be sure, to be heard
We want to be heard and you're all
You're all I want, yeah, all I want
So tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
Tell me, where have you been?

[Verse 3]
Fashion isn't dead
No, it's just inside out
It's just inside out
She says she needs a priest
Wants to get closer to God
I say all I need's a ladder
I want to touch your sky

[Bridge]
You want it all
Do you want it all?
Do you want it all?
Do you want it all?
[Outro]
And you're heavy in my heart
You're heavy in my hands
You're heavy in my mouth
Yes, you're heavy in my day
You're heavy in my songs
You're heavy in my light
And you're all that I want
Yeah, you're all that I want
Yeah, you're all that I want
Yeah, you're all that I want
God, you're all that I want
Oh, you're all I want
