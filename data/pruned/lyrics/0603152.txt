You know what I wonder sometimes
Like, do you know we far we can go if only you believe in me?
Ha, yeah, imagine that

[Verse 1: Keyshia Cole]
Did you know that I
When I say I told you I loved you, loved you
And did you know that I was really sincere
When I couldn't go creepin', creepin' around
And everything that I told you, I'd be for you
I could really be for you, baby
Just give me give me give me a chance
And let me show (Show you)
How I really feel (Really feel for you)
You are everything

[Verse 2: Nas]
Uh, she says Nas show me the inside your Benz
I'm just tryna show you trust and the beauty of bein' friends
They just wanna love and leave ya, cut you then sleaze
Tell the world how they beat ya
I'm tryna show you somethin' deeper
Movie night at the crib, double feature
Turn off your phone, you can moan
We in the love makin' marathon
You hit notes you never known (Yeah)
In the streets, I need chrome and ammunition
But at home you just want me to listen (Alright)
Check it
Your friends is hating 'cause they feel the dating messing with you concentration
And it kills 'em that I'm your fascination
Picture life as my wife, just think
Full length sable, seven carats in your navel (Yeah)
Ballers inside the club try to send you they best (Oh-oh)
Put tattoos on your chest spelling N-A-S
Tanning no bikini in the sands of Fiji Miami
In my Lamborghini, KC believe
(That's why you got me singin')

Oh-oh (Yeah)
Yeah-yea (Come on, baby)
Oh-oh

[Outro: Keyshia Cole]
Yeah, you know all I needed you to do is believe in us
You know what I'm sayin'
But I guess that's the way love goes
Oh, oh-oh, baby
I'm not in if only you believe in me, oh
