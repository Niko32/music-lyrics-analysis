Never let the beat breathe
Fuego
Still up in the sushi spot eating all the motherfucking payrolls
They know
That's Fuego
That's Joven Fuuego
Fuego flow
Tell 'em they don't know

[Verse: L.A. VanGogh]
Fuego in this bitch pull a muhfucking fire alarm
I got a hot hand, and fire arm, with a barrel so big that it look like it fire arms
Cannon mouth closed, you don't wanna see this fire yawn
Tired of these parodies
Game need a pair of me's
Peace Up is the reign tell the driver put the wipers on
And I'm tryna get it rolling like it's X in my hand kinda like I'm tryna put a tire on
You ain't fitted for this, cap, don't even gotta try it on
You just worried bout the wrong things
I'm tryna make an album that my family can retire on
I'm the new connect
Tell these dial up niggas they gone have to wait
Called me for 40 keys, and I told him I got 88
Black and white desegregate
Fuck walking on water
Little panther just learned how to levitate
A phony nigga that's an individual with whom I shall never self-affiliate
Get it straight
As long as the world still tilts on an axis
Ima spit that that'll make a paralyzed man do the cat daddy into a backflip
Acrobatics, Afro black shit
Chiropractics, hope somebody got your back cause all these raps is
Allen Iverson interviews
This is not a game, we talking practice
Samurai tactics when I make cuts
Dancing on the track, Jabba Wockee in a relay
All I need is some head while I'm watching ESPN top 10 replays
These cats so street, I'm eway
Fuck drugs, war on DEA
Crack is wack, but what's wacker is that blacks doing bids like they shopping on eBay
Little consciousness, whatever
Hold your head to my fellas in the ant farms
Life is a test but I pray that I never see the pen like a scantron
I could never be PC
Voices in my head tell me Mac more
I got the flow down like a carpet layer, but your flow always fall through like a Scooby doo trap door
Aw naw. My circle shaping up to be actually what we asked for
What we gotta act for?
I heard you like to hang with a square like a backboard. Mmmm
Picture painting pupil pay the piper for a petty paying occupation, pshh, please, player, i ain't that patient
Picture putting poverty on a pedestal, pedigree every nation on the planet I'm Triple H'ing
I'm from where they gentrified the city making all them bad boys like diddy
I'm from where they segregated, closed schools, just to make the city look pretty
I be like "Fuck Rahm" on daily
Progressing against oppression we gone make it
Grandma say I shouldn't curse so much, but that don't mean I'm not educated
Rap game Bonilla-Silva
I'm a silverback gorilla when I rap
Beast mode, you gone need a cheat code and a deep throat to swallow all your pride when you hear Gizzogh snap
Your city ain't cold
Shout out Real Talk man that be boy spiffy
Shout out Frankiem, shout out to Mellow King
Man we 424 like a rookie Ken Griffey
Tired of being nice now it's a fuego in ya face
Get ya bodied tanned fully
With something this mean when I drop on the net, I might get called a cyber bully
L.A. VanG-O, so many bars, that I came with CO
You ain't heard about me?
Ask ya girl, fam, she know
Bout that fuego flow, phenomon, fuego
Still up the sushi spot eating all the motherfucking pay rollsYou might also like
