You said all you needed was some part time love
You said I would never be the only one
And that was good with me
Why you think I stayed around?
You said you and your man was tryna make things right
And that's why I would always be the nigga on the side
That's what you said to me, yeah
Look who's tryna wife me now

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know you ain't right
All of a sudden you wanna change up your mind
It was all good until we turned off the lights
And you opened your legs and you let me inside
Now you sprung
You said you wasn't tripping, now look at you, you sprung
You was acting hard at first, guess that was a front
I remember you said we was just having fun, just having fun

[Chorus]
When we hooked up, when we sat down
We made an agreement and vowed that
That we'd never, be together
That we'd never be together
When we hooked up, when we sat down
We made an agreement and vowed that
That we'd never, be together
That we'd never be together

Hol' up, hol' up, girl, you knew what it was
Back then when we started off
I remember you said that it wouldn't be hard at all
Maybe that was just the alcohol, talking to me
We had a couple drinks and a few sake bombs
Didn't I want you, girl? Told you my shit was bomb
I know, I did, but you wasn't ready
Put it on you, now you can't forget it
Every time you be with your man
You be thinking 'bout me and the way I hit it
I ain't even mad, I'm just tryna remind you
That we agreed we wouldn't cross that line

[Pre-Chorus]
Girl, you know you ain't right
All of a sudden you wanna change up your mind
It was all good until we turned off the lights
And you opened your legs and you let me inside
Now you sprung
You said you wasn't tripping, now look at you, you sprung
You was acting hard at first, guess that was a front
I remember you said we was just having fun, just having fun

[Chorus]
When we hooked up, when we sat down
We made an agreement and vowed that
That we'd never, be together
That we'd never be together
When we hooked up, when we sat down
We made an agreement and vowed that
That we'd never, be together
That we'd never be together
