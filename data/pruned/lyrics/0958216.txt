But another hungry kid has died
Free the world – while they start another
War and leaders raise their glasses high

Oh mother Earth-
Who really cares about your tears
Who will be there to comfort you

Right now – we should all take the chance
Right now – we should all join our hands
Don´t you know right now-
It´s time to change our minds
This world is wanted – dead or alive

Save the wales – is a good word to disguise
While our oceans are bound to die
Save our souls – in the name of Jesus Christ
While the spring of love are running dry

Oh mother Earth-
How long will this be going on
And who will be your heir
When you´re dead and goneYou might also like
