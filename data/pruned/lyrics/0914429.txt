So I can climb those hills
So when they throw their nets
I'll be climbing further out of their reach
Don't leave me alone
Always stand by my side
So when the tides get rough
Billows are tossing
Show me ways to survive
Give me sight so I can see
Right through the dark
So when they dig their pit
I won't stumble in it
You're my light to escape
Mmmmmmmmmmmmmm, mmmmmmmm
Give me strength to be strong
To climb this hill every day
So when they throw their nets
I still climbing further out of their reach
Don't leave me alone
Always stand by my side
So when the tides get rough
Billows are tossing
Show me ways to survive
Give me sight so I can see
See right through the dark
So when they dig their pit
I won't stumble in it
You're my light to escape
So when they dig their pit
I won't stumble in it
You're my light to escape
Give me strength to be strong
So I can climb those hills
So when they throw their nets
I still climbing further out of their reach
Don't leave me alone
Always stand by my side
When the tides get rough
Billows are tossing
Show me ways to survive
