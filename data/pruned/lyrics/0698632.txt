Where you been hiding all week girl?
I been all over this beach girl
In every bar, in every place
Somehow I missed your pretty face
But you knock me off of my feet girl

[Refrain]
Yeah in the morning I'll be gone, gone, gone
Oh baby that's just wrong, wrong, wrong

[Chorus]
Wish I'd a met you on night one
Before the week, we'd had you and me
Being drunk, tangled up, waking up
No, we wouldn't be done
Just getting started
Every night, another party
Making out in a crowd
What I give right now to have seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this
So down, son
I wish I woulda met you on Night One

[Verse 2]
Let me dry those tears from your eyes girl
Let's make the most of our time girl
Still got the rest of this night
For me to hold you so tight
'Fore we say our goodbyes girl
You might also like[Refrain]
Yeah in the morning you'll be gone, gone, gone
So baby let's just hold on

[Chorus]
Wish I'd a met you on night one
Before the week, we'd had you and me
Being drunk, tangled up, waking up
No, we wouldn't be done
Just getting started
Every night, another party
Making out in a crowd
What I give right now to have seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this
So down, son
I wish I woulda met you on Night One
Girl we woulda had one hell of a time
If I had met you on night one

[Refrain]
Yeah in the morning we'll be gone, gone, gone
Yeah baby that's just wrong

[Chorus]
Wish I'd a met you on night one
What a week, we'd had you and me
Being drunk, tangled up
Waking up, no we wouldn't be done
Just getting started
Every night, another party
Making out in a crowd
What I give right now to have
Seven more days of your sweet kiss
Instead of a few more hours feeling like this
Slow down, sun
I wish I woulda met you on night one
I wish I woulda met you on night one
Yeah yeah, I wish I woulda met you on night one
I wish I woulda met you on night one
