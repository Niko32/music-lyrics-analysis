Just to see him smile makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him is to love love love him

I'll be good to him, I'll bring love to him
Everyone says there'll come a day when I'll walk alongside of him
Yes just to know him is to love love love him
And I do

Someday he will see that he was meant for me

[Verse]
To know know know him is to love love love him
Just to see him smile makes my life worthwhile
To know know know him is to love love love him
And I doYou might also like
