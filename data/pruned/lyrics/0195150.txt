Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
There's always cracks
A crack of sunlight
A crack in the mirror or on your lips
It's the morning on a sunset Friday
When all conversations twist
It's the fifth day of ice on a new tattoo
But the ice should be on our heads
We only spun the web to catch ourselves
So we weren't left for dead

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was never lookin' for approval from anyone but you
And though this journey's over, I'd go back if you ask me to

[Chorus]
I'm not dead, just floating
Right between the ink on your tattoo
In the belly of the beast we turned into
I'm not scared, just changing
Right behind the cigarette and the devilish smile
You're my crack of sunlight
You might also like[Verse 2]
You can do the math a thousand ways, but you can't erase the facts
That others come and others go, but you always come back
I'm the winter flower underground, always thirsty for summer rain
And just like the change of seasons
I know you'll be back again

[Chorus]
I'm not dead, just floating
Underneath the ink of my tattoo
I've tried to hide my scars from you
I'm not scared, just changing
Right behind the cigarette and the devilish smile
You're my crack of sunlight, oh

[Bridge]
I'm not dead just yet
I'm not dead, I'm just floating
Doesn't matter where I'm going
I'll find you (I'm not scared at all)
Underneath the cuts and bruises
Finally gained what no one loses
I'll find you (I will find you)

[Outro]
I'm not dead, just floating
I'm not scared, just changing
You're my crack of sunlight. yeah
