(Chant)

[Verse 1]
Me all alone
Jug of rum
Me stand and wait for the boat to come
Is lonely night, is quiet the dark
The boat, she late, it's 12 o' clock
Me watches the tide easing in
Is low the moon, but high the wind

[Chorus]
Havana Moon [x2]

[Verse 2]
Me all alone
Me open the rum
Is long the wait for the boat to come
American girl, come back to me
Sail away across the sea
We dock in New York, the buildings high
We find a home up in the sky

[Chorus]
You might also like[Verse 3]
Me still alone, me drinking the rum
Begin to think that the boat no come
American girl, she tell a lie
She say till then, but she mean goodbye

[Chorus]

[Verse 4]
Me lay down alone, no good the rum
Me fall asleep and the boat she come
The girl she look till come the dawn
She weep and she cry
Return for home
The whistle blow, me open my eyes
Bright the sun, blue the sky
Me grab me shoes, me jump and me run
Me see the boat head for horizon
Havana Moon, is gone da rum
The boat she sail, me love she gone

[Chorus]
