Yeah this one here goes to Riversdale park, Avondale. For all the snot nosed kids, check

[Verse 1]
This basketball court tells my life without no more talk
Foot prints still in the floor from where my fours walked
Memories still in my thoughts from back in fourth-form
And chalk still drawn up on the wall for the score-board
And in the breeze
I hear the old wind kicking leaves
As I sit in tree's, watching little me sitting three's
I smell the tar seal burning in the summer sun
And melting bubblegum mixed with burning rubber from my bikes back tire
Leaving marks in the park
Car park parts had my name carved in in bark
Blood stains remain like my first tattoo
Written in the concrete with a piece of bamboo
And I go back now and again
To get up outta my head
And think about it, all the hours I've spent
And I can hear the ball bouncing again
And sometimes I can even here the sound of the net
Like 'hwishhh'

[Hook]
Just walking through the street
With nothing on our feet
Just snotty little kids playing 5-on-5
Sitting in the dark
With the bums in the park
And the bottle on the bench on a Friday night
Chilling by myself
Just me and no one else
Looking at the world from the three-point line
From 3 feet tall
All the way to 24
This basketball court it knows my life
You might also like[Verse 2]
Now as the days flew
This new hoop is where we came to
Same crew
Same old suede's, but they were sprayed blue
Same view, nothing had changed
Just the chain's new
And the tape played break-loose for us to break to
The same moon would light the court
Every night just like a torch
While the old folks called their kids in from by the porch
And you can tell the ones who grew up here
Cause they used the gear their older brothers
Used to wear like a souvenir
Its like we do a loop
I'm looking at my new recruit
Playing on that same hoop
Where we used to shoot
And now we sit up on the park bench
Sippin' Ma√ü, sippin' jack
Where we sat, in the days
Pickin' scabs
Sittin' back in the pitch black
As I reminisce on every swish
-missing every shot I ever missed
And I remember still
Ain't forgot it, probably never will
The day I beat will 7 nil
Its real..

[Verse 3]
I went home today
And that court where we'd, go to play's
Been bull-dozed away
Now the only stain
From the, olden days
Are the marks in the park from the, roller blades
And the fingerprints left on the black board
A blank wall and a flat ball
But that's all
There's no more lights
No more fights, for who's like Mike
And no games that go all night
There's no more; Life
I pick up a rock and take a jump shot
That I once got from that one spot
And I remember how it felt being young
As I count 3 2 1
I guess one day, we all gotta end the game
I never would of made the NBA anyway
But I'll never let my memory fade
And when, ever I play
I re-member the days..
