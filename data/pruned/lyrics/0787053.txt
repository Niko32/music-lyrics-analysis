Daylight falls, and I'm lost in the big parade
Hold my hand, darling, I'm afraid of the daylight
Shade is dark
Cool and languid for life or love
Safe in shadows, never stark as the daylight
As the daylight

[Bridge]
When I was just knee high
My mama told me, never try
To be someone that I am not
Yet over time I had forgot
The wandering child so lost at play
He's found himself but he can't find his way
In the daylight
Oh, the daylight

Ooh, daylight
Ooh, daylight

[Verse 2]
Life is short, and there's no turning back the time
Fragrant meadows and rocks to climb in the daylight
In my mind
There's a corner I need to turn
Lessons lived is a lesson learned in the daylight
In the daylight
You might also like[Bridge]
I miss the forest shade
You took me there, the promise I made
To never leave the dark so deep
Safe and soothing, yet I fear
As I recall and now reflect
I see it's safer to connect
To the daylight
Ooh, the daylight (Light)

Ooh, daylight
Ooh, daylight

[Outro]
Daylight falls, and I'm lost in the big parade
Hold my hand, darling, I'm afraid of the daylight
Of the day...
