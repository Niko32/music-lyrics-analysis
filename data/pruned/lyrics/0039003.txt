"Y'all know the rules"

Verse 1:
California critical shit 12" inch
One strip so they eat up your whole compact disc
Los Angeles
Take they terrorists
Blond wave black fist incredible lyricist
In a never endin' quest to get rich
I hold a grip with time to breathe
More tricks up my sleeve than about forty thieves
With forty ____ in a weed spot runnin' they tree
All money to me the 360 degree
Now we max and relax like cool breeze
But they all fucked up in the street
Avoidin' front page fame so I'm holdin' my heat
So low key that none of you niggas is knowin' me
In '98 I only see weed
Only we hopin' Allah see me
And only be left bless my family tree
Until 2000 but fuck school like '83
Off Hennessy for all enemy
Lovin' dollars like all you gangstas love Impalas
Never put a bitch before your momma
Stay tuned
For the love hella right to 12 jewels
Nigga you know the rules
