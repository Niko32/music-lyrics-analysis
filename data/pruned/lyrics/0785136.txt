Tree swallows houses
Migration to a town where
Tree, swallows, houses

Like a match you've started
We're all ageing doubles
We sing, hello, hello, hello
Hello

We danced shoes on shoes
To the sound of the spinning machine
We slept arm-in-arm
So soundly ignoring the outside sounds of the
Ongoing horrible scene
