Yeah, yeah yeah

[Verse 1: Brian & Howie]
It seems like yesterday when I said, "I do"
And after all this time
My heart still burns for you
If you don't know by now that you're my only one
Then take a look inside me
And watch my heartstrings come undone
I know I promised you forever
Is there no stronger word I can use
To reassure you when the storm
Is raging outside
You're my safest place to hide

[Chorus: Brian & All]
Can you see me, here I am (here I am)
I need you like I needed you then
When I feel like giving up
I climb inside your heart and still find (you're my)
You're my safest place to hide

[Verse 2: Nick & AJ]
You see colors no one else can see
In every breath you hear a symphony
You understand me like nobody can
I feel my soul unfolding
Like a flower blooming
When this whole world gets too crazy
And there's nowhere left to go
I know you give me sanctuary
You're the only truth I know
You're the road back home
You might also like[Chorus: AJ with All, AJ]
Can you see me, here I am
Standing here where I've always been
And when words are not enough
I climb inside your heart and still find
You're my safest place to hide
(My safest place to hide)

[Bridge: Kevin]
I know I promised you forever
Is there no stronger word I can use
To reassure you when the storm
Is raging outside
You're my safest place to hide

[Chorus: Nick with All, (AJ), Brian & Nick]
Oh! Can you see me (see me)
Here I am (here I am)
Standing here where I've always been
(Where I've always been)
When I feel like giving up (oh-oh)
I climb inside your heart and still find
Yeah-yeah
You're my safest place to hide, oh yeah
You're my safest place to hide
