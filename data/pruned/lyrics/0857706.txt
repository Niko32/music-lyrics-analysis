Another wants me to cry
A part of me wants to smile
Another wants to be free
Why do I need to feel
Feel like on the edge
Evils reflecting our self, in moments of pain
Envy or murders against someone that you blame
A part of me wants to live
Another wants me to cry
A part of me wants to smile
Another wants to be free
Demons inside me
They are calling me
Voices in my head
At the gates of madness
Why do I need to feel
Feel like on the edge
A part of me wants to live
Another wants me to cry
A part of me wants to smile
Another wants to be free
Demons inside me
They are calling me
Voices in my head
At the gates of madness
Why do I need to feel
Feel like on the edge
Demons inside me
They are calling me
Voices in my head
