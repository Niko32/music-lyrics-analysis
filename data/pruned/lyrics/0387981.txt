You gotta give a little, take a little
And let your poor heart break a little
That's the story of, and that's the glory of love

[Verse 2]
Now laugh a little, cry a little
Until the clouds roll by a little
That's the story of, that's the glory of love

[Bridge]
As long as there's the two of us
We've got the world and all its charms
And when the world is through with us
We've got each other's arms

[Verse 3]
You gotta win a little, lose a little
And always have the blues a little
'Cause that's the story of, yeah, that's the glory of love

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
As long as there's the two of us
We've got the world and all it's charms
But when the world is through with us
We've got each other's arms
You might also like[Verse 3]
You've got to win a little, lose a little
And always have the blues a little
'Cause that's the story of, that's the glory of love
'Cause that's the story of, and that's the glory of love
