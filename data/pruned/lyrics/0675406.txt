Like Picasso said in 1910
I'm gonna paint me a mandolin
Could be cubes, it could be curves
I like to mix the paint with nerve
I load my brush and fire away
Paint me a hole in the light of day

[Chorus]
Well, you can play it straight or play it from left field
You got to play it just the way you feel
Come on, boys, play it again
Play it on Picasso's mandolin

[Verse 2]
Well, it's coloring books and drinking wines
Its hard to stay between the lines
Now there ain't no rule if you don't break it
Ain't no chance if you don't take it
Said the damnedest thing he'd ever heard
Was trying to learn to sing from a mockingbird

[Chorus]
Well, you can play it straight or play it from left field
You got to play it just the way you feel
Come on, boys, play it again
Play it on Picasso's mandolin
You might also like[Verse 3]
Well, Picasso said before he died
There's one more painting I'd like to try
Well, the doctor held his breath
And then Picasso nailed a mandolin
He's born in Spain and died in France
He was not scared of baggy pants

[Chorus]
Well, you can play it straight or play it from left field
You got to play it just the way you feel
Come on, boys, play it again
Play it on Picasso's mandolin

[Outro]
Play it straight or play it from left field
You got to play it just the way you feel
Come on, boys, play it again
Play it on Picasso's mandolin
