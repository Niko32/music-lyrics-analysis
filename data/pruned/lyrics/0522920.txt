I'm one to talk
But you're so drunk you cannot walk
And you make no sense
Just slips and slurs between your lips
And your eyes have shrunk
To pins like pissholes in the snow
And you're so fucked up
You have no clue you missed my show

Two greedy hands
You've got them stuck inside my shirt
And I bite my tongue
Cause I know that love's supposed to hurt
I'm feeling sick
I don't like the way you look at her
But you just laugh
And stick your tongue inside my mouth

[Chorus]
If you don't want me I don't care to know
Cause in a moment I'll feel beautiful
We both collide like we are crashing cars
We fall together and forget ourselves
And in a moment we feel something new
There's no one else, there's only me and you
But when we pull apart I feel unloved
And you just become another thing I wish I hadn't done
You might also like[Verse 2]
You take me home
Like a piece of lint stuck on my clothes
Put a record on
And sit there mouthing all the words
And it don't feel good
As I press my back into the wall
But a little love
Better having that than none at all

[Chorus]
If you don't want me I don't care to know
Cause in a moment I'll feel beautiful
We both collide like we are crashing cars
We fall together and forget ourselves
And in a moment we feel something new
There's no one else, there's only me and you
But when we pull apart I feel unloved
And you just become another thing I wish I hadn't done

[Bridge]
I wish I hadn't done
It never lasts
No one wants to feel unlovable
But everybody has a place you cannot touch
And everybody has a hungry mouth to feed
We fall into bed like we are second best
[Outro]
So once you rob the future
So once your rob ourselves
So in love with the problem
We'll be solving all our lives
