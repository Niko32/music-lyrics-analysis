No image at all
Too cold for their sick industry
But hey, as the phrase goes: "bad weeds grow tall"
And we are back again!

We are back
We are back
We are back
We are back
Back for...

War is the hole
Suffering is the key
The earache will still going on
Consistent, annoying, suicide in your veins
The inc is back again
Back again
Back again
Back again

[Guitar Solo]

No God damn rock stars
No image at all
Too cold for their sick industry
But hey, as the phrase goes: "bad weeds grow tall"
And we are back again!

Back for war
