Well I'm burnin' down the red carpet tonight
Bright lights city nights
Bust through the front door
All I want is more and more
Bad girls make it right
I'm a bad, bad girl and
Bad girls make it right
B, b, b, bad, bad girls
Bad girls workin' overtime

[Chorus]
I'm a bad bad girl
I'm a bad bad girl

Look to my right
Look to my left
I want you and you and you and your friend
Grab me a shot
I'll give you the world
I want to make you mine!
I'm a bad, bad girl
Bad girls make it right
B, b, b, bad, bad girls
Bad girls workin' overtime
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm a bad bad girl
I'm a bad bad girl
I'm a bad bad girl
I'm a bad bad girl

Yea, yea, yea I like it
Yea, yea, yea I want it
Yea, yea, yea I need it
Yea, yea, yea

You know I'm a bad girl!
Said I'm a bad girl!

It's my life, it's my life
Let me take you high
It's my life, it's my life
Let me take you high

[Chorus]
I'm a bad, bad girl
I'm a bad, bad girl
I'm a bad, bad girl
I'm a bad, bad girl
