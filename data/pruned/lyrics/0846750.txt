Mountains of man's division
They all were first like no one else
Walking the path to perdition
Joking champs choking tramps
Feed us with tired visions
We've heard it before you've heard it before

Talk like us act like us
We are your imagination
Golgotha road is tough you know
So we've paved it for generations

The parrot says what the poet said, don't give no explanations
We've heard it before you've heard it before, come on!

Yeah, plant your seeds in firn and wait for them
Yeah, behold the work that no one represents
Come on, flog that skin again again again
Get it, weak will punish weaker

You are kicking in unlocked doors, where is your perception
Turning the same stone all over again, waiting for the exception
Now the poet says what the parrot said, collective recollection
We've been here, you've been before, come on!
You might also likeYeah, plant your seeds in firn and wait for them
Yeah, behold the work that no one represents
Come on, flog that skin again again again
Get it, weak will punish weaker once again

Must walk the other way
To find out what is mine
I know I can not stay
Gotta leave it all behind

You better stay on track
And remember what they said
Or they will stab you in the back
And leave you there for dead
For dead, for dead, for dead
