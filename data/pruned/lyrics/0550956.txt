We just want to get 'em back to the NBA to start thinking about Seattle. Seattle's a great town, they deserve it and a lot of people want to see my jersey retired up in that rafters with you. If it never comes back I think my jersey will never get retired then. You know, but that's just the way it goes. You know, and I hope it comes back and I think the Seattle fans deserve a basketball team

Certainty, I can trust who?
Based on past experience, I'm saying fuck you
Not one, you just have no clue
All the things that you can't, I currently do

[Verse 1: MSTRFRD]

I look up to the sky, all I see is clouds
My hands no longer together been years since I bowed
Not really one to commit, therefore I never vowed
Less stress to compress, only one to make proud
It's always been encouraged, but never allowed
It's your truth don't keep it in, read it aloud
A field full of dreams, clearly needs to be plowed
Continue collectin' thoughts, always remain endowed
Based on past experience, I am brilliance
Always rebounding, check my resilience
You can't be looking for me, there's no resemblance
I won't see you when I get there; going the distance
Big bang oh my god what's your existence
Don't insist to resist, show your persistence
I always stay with the rock, need no assistance
It's act one something new, enjoy the commencement

[Verse 2: MSTRFRD]

I'm still lookin' up, being left confused
All I got is time, nothing left to lose
Understand it's my choice, no one made me choose
Been standing so long my body's beginnin' to bruise
My mind lost in wonder, what happens when it stews
Pardon the look on my face, I'm truly not enthused
Heard the reviews, I pursed, was left amused
They just accused they argued, I just refused
I'm a pro with these verbs, I'm a genius
I'm not talkin' about proverbs and genesis
I'm just sayin' that it's your world and you gotta make it
Because the next guys right behind you ready to take it
Based on past experience I'm 89 percent
Fuck with me now or you'll regret all the time you spent
Hurry up because the clocks runnin' out fast
Lookin' up this time without doubt, will be my last
