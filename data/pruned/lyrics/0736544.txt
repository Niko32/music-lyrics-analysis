I see a bad moon rising
I see trouble on the way
I see earthquakes and lightning
I see bad times today

[Chorus]
Now don't go around tonight
For it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

[Verse 2]
I hear hurricanes a-blowing
I know the end is coming soon
I fear the river's overflowing
I hear the voice of rage and ruin

[Chorus]
Now don't go around tonight
For it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

[Guitar and Piano Solos]

[Verse 3]
I hope you have got your things together
Hope you are quite prepared to die
Looks like we're in for nasty weather
One eye is taken for an eye
You might also like[Chorus]
Now don't go around tonight
For it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise

[Chorus]
Yeah, don't go around tonight
For it's bound to take your life
There's a bad moon on the rise
