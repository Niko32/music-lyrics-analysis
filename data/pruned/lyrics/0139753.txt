B-R-Double O-K-L-Y-N
Don't have to spell it
You know that it's Brooklyn
Next one down is
The next one that's lookin'
Leave their pockets empty and their whole body shooken
No one can cross the lines that I'm hookin'
Before you visit anywhere else
You gotta visit here first, Brooklyn

[Verse 1: Lil' Mil]
Yeah, Deion at the corner
The ultimate coroner
Always give respect to the one that borned her
From Coney Island up to Williamsburg
We in your way like an iceberg
Atlantic all the way
Pennsylvania to Jamaica Bay
We'll turn that "good morning" into
"have your last day, anything else to say?"
Lately been listening to Dre
So like him, 20 years and I'll still be here to stay
Being the man ain't easy
Especially at home
You could say I haven't grown
But I'm 20 at 5 it would've shown
Now all I do is moan and groan
And spit into this damn microphone
Kids think they ghetto when they mention Tyrone
But they haven't been in the environment
When you ain't even safe at home
You might also like[Hook]

[Verse 2: Lil' Mil]
You mess with us
It's 1000 ways to die
Go 'head little pussy keep it up and cry
You know what happens when you lie
Never had nothin' to cherish
No one to look upon
Something must've gone wrong when my family tree was drawn
Start of the day is at dawn
Complete the mission
Then pretend to be like Shawn
Drivin' through Marcy for the fun of it
