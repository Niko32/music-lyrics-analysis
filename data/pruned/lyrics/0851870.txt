Somehow I came across you
When the lights went out I fell beside you

It's a pretty trick
I'll pray someone has taught you
If you leave me crushed, I'll crawl to find you

Love comes quickly and i'm indisposed
And what I can't describe is what I want the most
Love so sickening, and I'm indisposed
And what I can't describe is what I want the most
Love comes quickly, and i'm indisposed
And what I can't describe is all i wanted

Feeling freezes so I know it must be
Time to leave you dear
Everything's warm when your heart grows cold
Feeling freezes when I know you want me
It's time to leave you here
Everything's warm when your heart grows cold

Shining like a God
You descended with me
When I lit your sky I saw too clearly
I could see your tears
And as you went to heal me
They consumed my own, and drowned your beauty

And what I can't describe is what I want the most
Love so sickening, and I'm indisposed
And what you can't provide is all I wanted

Feeling freezes so I know it must be
Time to leave you, dear
Everything's warm when your heart grows cold
Feeling freezes when I know you want me
It's time to leave you here
Everything's warm when your heart grows cold
Everything's warm when your heart grows cold
Everything's warm
When I know you want me
When I know you want me
Everything's cold
When I know you want me
When I know you want me
When I know you want me
And I know you want me

Feeling freezes so I know it must be
Time to leave you, dear
Everything's warm when your heart grows cold
Feeling freezes when I know you want me
It's time to leave you here
Everything's warm when your heart grows cold
Feeling freezes so I know it must be
Time to leave you, dear
Everything's warm when your heart grows cold
Feeling freezes when I know you want me
It's time to leave you here
Everything's warm when your heart grows cold
Everything's warm
Everything's warm
Everything's warm (when your heart grows cold)
Everything's warm
Everything's warm when your heart grows cold
Everything's warm
