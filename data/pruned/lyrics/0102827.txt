I'm on a mission, yeah
I'm on a mission for Peter of pocket peter, if you getting the difference
Yeah, you know I'm hitting that
Getting the kitten, I've got positions [and dishes?]
That we could try in the kitchen, so tell me

[Hook: Rone]
Do you have any place to go
Do you have any place to go
Do you have any place to go

Do you have any place to go
You know this world is awful cold
I know some things you hardly know
But let me tell you that my home
We can't get [guilt-ed?] when we're grown
I bet it's better when we don't wanna face this town alone

If we get a little green, we going to paint the town red
I said put it on black, but she blew it instead
A fresh face, some big brown eyes
A yellow night sky, and some little white lies
I  could see right through her disguise
I would let her be my demise, some big brown eyes
A yellow night sky, and some little white lies

I'm getting greedy, taking it from the needy
Fiend-ing for everything that I'm seeing up on the T.V
I'm in a part of the city that's even a little seedy
Heading back to the car, and now it's really feeling easy
Yeah, to get it poppin', I just pop in my CD
And we're making communications, that don't mean that we're speaking
Yeah, so please believe me cause it feels like I'm cheating
When I'm giving the business to the company I'm keeping
