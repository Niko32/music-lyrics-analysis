It's what will send a salmon fighting upstream
The force that through the blue vein keeps moving you
To some meeting with me that was set in a dream

I am coming to get you I've got your DNA
I am coming to get you you will not get away
I am coming to get you you will never be late
I am coming to get you and this is your fate

I feel the rush, need your touch
I have a crush, crush...
You may be tough, well
It's not enough
Against this crush, crush-

Heavy water pressing on the floor of the sea
The pressure keeps on building until you cannot breathe
Heavy weather driving you where you need be
You might as well be escape gravity

I am coming to get you I've got your DNA
I am coming to get you you will not get away
I am coming to get you you will never be late
I am coming to get you and this is your fate
You might also likeI feel the rush, need your touch
I want to crush, crush...
You may be tough, well its not enough
Against this crush, crush..(x2)

Crush...
Crush...

I feel the rush, need your touch
I want to crush, crush...
You may be tough, well its not enough
Against this crush, crush..(x2)

You're no longer in control
This is pullin' through your soul
Crush, crush...
I don't even call it love
Its just something in the blood
Crush, crush...

I feel the rush, need your touch
I need to crush, crush...
You may be tough, well its not enough
Against this crush, crush..
