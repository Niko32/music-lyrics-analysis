Ah, na-na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na, na, oh
I want you so
Doo-doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo-ooh

[Verse 1]
Try to say, how I feel
When I'm holding you close to me
But my temperature rises so I can hardly believe
That finally you came to me
We made loneliness our enemy
Don't go, don't you know

[Chorus]
Feels so right
And I can hold you longer if you stay the night, oh
The time is right
And we will grow much stronger if you stay the night
Tonight, pretty baby

[Post-Chorus]
Stay the night, night

[Verse 2]
Words cannot express to you
How I'm burning up deep inside
I took one look and I knew
This was a feeling I couldn't fight
But now that you're here with me
Now that you're here with me, hey
Let's make togetherness our destiny
Don't go, ho, ho
You might also like[Chorus]
Feels so right
And I can hold you longer if you stay the night, oh, oh
The time is right
And we will grow much stronger if you stay the night
Tonight with me, baby

[Bridge]
At the start I thought it was too good to be true
But now I know that, all along it should have been me and you
At the start I thought it was too good to be true
But now I know that, all along it should have been me and you
Feels so right, doo-doo-doo, ooh
Stay the night
The time is right, doo-doo-doo, ooh
Stay the night

[Chorus]
Feels so right
But I can hold you longer if you stay the night, oh, oh
The time is right
And we will grow much stronger if you stay (Stay the night)

[Outro]
It feels so right
