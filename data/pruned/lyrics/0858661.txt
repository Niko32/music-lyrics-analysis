Forget all your sorrows
And dance
Like there ain't no tomorrow
Don't ya know God loves ya when you're dancin'
The only second best thing to romancin'
While everybody else is out havin' fun
Don't be the only one
Just take a chance
Shake your pants
Everybody just dance
Just dance
Have you forgotten to dance?
Yeah like nobody's watching
Don't you know God loves it when you're dancin'
The only second best thing to romancin'
It ain't no fun standing against the wall
While everybody's out having a ball
Just take a chance
Shake your pants
Everybody just dance
Just dance
Just dance
Forget your behavior
And dance
Shake what your momma gave ya
It ain't no fun standing against the wall
When everybody's out having a ball
Just take a chance
Shake your pants
Everybody just dance
Just dance
Just dance
Forget all your sorrow
And dance
Like there ain't no tomorrow
Don't you know God loves it when you're dancin'
The only second best thing to romancin'
When everbody else is out havin' fun
Don't be the only one
Just take a chance
Shake your pants
Everybody just dance

Forget your behavior

Shake what your momma gave ya
It ain't no fun standing against the wall
While everybody's out having a ball
