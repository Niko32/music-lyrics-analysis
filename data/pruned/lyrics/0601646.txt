Blues, you're a buzzkill
You sneak up on my pain pills
Jack Daniels can't swallow you whole
Hey Blues, you're a tough act to follow

[Pre-Chorus]
Ain't no needle that can kill
The pain that I feel
No smoke that can clear all this air
Hey Blues, nothing compares

[Chorus]
To the way that you hurt
The way that you sting
The way that you bring me
Down to my knees
If whiskey can't drown you
What the hell will
Hey Blues, you're a buzzkill

[Verse 2]
You showed up at a party
Where I thought I'd partied so hard
That you'd be gone for good
Hey Blues, guess I misunderstood
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You're good at disguising
And I'm good at lying
Right here, in some stranger's bed
Hey Blues, you're over my head

[Chorus]
With the way that you hurt
The way that you sting
The way that you bring me
Down to my knees
If whiskey can't drown you
What the hell will
Hey Blues, you're a buzzkill

The way that you hurt
The way that you sting
The way that you bring me
Down to my knees
If whiskey can't drown you
What the hell will
Hey Blues, you're a buzzkill
Hey Blues, you're a buzzkill
