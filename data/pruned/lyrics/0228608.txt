There's a rambleshackle shack
Down in old Caroline
It keeps a callin' me back
To that gal of mine
Yeah, If I had the wings
Of a beautiful dove
Yes, you know I'd fly away
To the gal that I love
Those two brown eyes
That sparkle with love
Shines down to me
From Heaven above
Well, If I had the wings
Of a beautiful dove
Yes, you know I'd fly away
To the gal that I love
--- Instrumental ---
When the whippoorwills call
On the hill far away
We'll, you could sing a love song
It's gonna help me to say
My love for you
Ain't gonna never, never die
Yes, I'd rather sing a song
Everyday that I die
There's a rambleshackle shack
Down in old Caroline
It keeps a callin' me back
To that gal of mine
Yeah, If I had the wings
Of a beautiful dove
Yes, you know I'd fly away
To the gal I love
There's a rambleshackle shack
Down in old Caroline
It keeps a callin' me back
To that gal of mine
Yes, If I had the wings
Of a beautiful dove
Yeah, I'd fly away
To the gal that I love..You might also like
