Away

[Verse 1]
Been on the road a dozen times now
Within the leeway, behind the sand house
The fascinatin' book of strings
Picks the leaves that drift down in between

[Bridge]
Suns to lift up in between
They told some stories like you've never seen
They just let everything drift down in between
Suns to lift up in between

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Mine to lift up and to follow
In the steps of fluids hollow
Without time we pick up all the streams
To find the leaves that drift down in between

[Bridge]
