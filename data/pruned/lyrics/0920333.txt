Take a look inside
See what they have to hide
What they do
With there lives
It’s a shame
I stay and I pray
Pray and pray
The truth is crawling
Into the back of my head
As I remember the past
Nothing stays forever
Nothing stays the same
Nothing stays forever
Nothing stays the same
At all
Nothing stays forever
Nothing stays the same
As I walked the roads
In Berlin
