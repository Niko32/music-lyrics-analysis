I had a melancholy malady
Went to see the doctor and the doctor say
Too bad, nothing he could do
He knew a man in Louisiana, if I’m willing to pay
Laid my money on the barrelhead
Man behind the bar began to shimmy and shake
Can't lie, I reckoned I was dead
When he picked my money up and I heard him say

[Chorus]
Meet me in the alleyway
Minute to midnight, don't be late
Meet me in the alleyway
Better come running, the spirits won't wait

[Verse]
Thirteen tiger teeth in my talisman
St. John the Conqueror and a black cat bone
I've been seen walking with the guardians
Now I’m in the alley and I’m all alone
Can't run, can't hide from destiny
Knew this day was calling nearly all of my life
Been done, ain't the only boy from Tennessee
To carve his name in cypress with a jawbone knife
You might also like[Chorus]
Meet me in the alleyway
Minute to midnight, don't be late
Meet me in the alleyway
Better come running, the spirits won't wait

[Bridge]
So you want to be the king of America
Say you want to know the oracle's mind
Say you want to see the Marquesses of Mardi Gras
Dancing with the devil at the end of the line

[Chorus]
Meet me in the alleyway
Minute to midnight, don't be late
Meet me in the alleyway
Better come running, the spirits won't wait

[Chorus]
Meet me in the alleyway
Minute to midnight, don't be late
Meet me in the alleyway
Better come running, the spirits won't wait
