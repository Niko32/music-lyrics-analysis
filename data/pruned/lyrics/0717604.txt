Maybe you love me, maybe you don't
Maybe we get along or maybe we don't
Or maybe we'll make it work, Lord knows I've tried
Even though you scared down the middle of my heart

[Verse 2]
For my mistakes I had to press one, must play
But my actions will cover for my decay
Rivers will fall back
Gonna take you back to the first time I met you
I tried my best but I'm so sorry I upset you

[Bridge]
You know what I've become
You know what I've become

[Chorus]
Been low but I've been higher
Been low but I've been higher
Been low but I've been higher
And higher and higher

[Verse 3]
So am I the reason or maybe the cause
Gonna see why I let her alone outside my clothes
Boy, listen, we must try and yeah, I know
And as you scar down the middle of my heart
You might also like[Verse 4]
For my mistakes I had to press one, must play
But my actions will cover for my decay
Rivers will fall back
Gonna take you back to the first time I met you
I tried my best but I'm so sorry I upset you

[Chorus x2]
Been low but I've been higher
Been low but I've been higher
Been low but I've been higher
And higher and higher

[Verse 5]
Maybe you love me, maybe you don't
Maybe we get along or maybe we don't
Oh baby, we'll make it work, Lord knows I've tried
Even though you scared down the middle of my heart

[Chorus x2]
Been low but I've been higher
Been low but I've been higher
Been low but I've been higher
And higher and higher
