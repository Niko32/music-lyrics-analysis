I could change my number, I could turn it off
I could hit decline but it wouldn't stop
Before I even answer, yeah I already know
What you'll be sayin' and where this conversation's gonna go

[Chorus]
It's another 2 A.M., call me up, drunk again
Cellphone lyin' on the nightstand turns into a buzz in my right hand
Sure baby, I'll pick you up
It's what I do, I miss your touch
I haven't moved on and you haven't moved on
It's way too soon to be alone
Here we go again, crossin' that line
Where you wanna go? Your place or mine?

[Verse 2]
Givin' in to you ain't such a crime
What's the harm of stealin' one more night?
We probably whisper, "Baby, I love you"
But you'll leave in the morning
Mean nothin' more to you

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Before I even answer, yeah I already know
What you'll be sayin' and where this conversation's gonna go
You might also like[Chorus]
