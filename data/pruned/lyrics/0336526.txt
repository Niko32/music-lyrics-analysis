How did it happen, when did we lose it
The love we looked for so long?
I'm sorry I called you, but it's the first night, you see
How does it feel to be free?

[Verse 2]
How does it feel now to reach out for someone
And find there's nobody there?
Is it weighing on you, because it's sure killing me
Tell me, how does it feel to be free?

[Bridge]
Funny how love is so hard to find
And yet so easy to lose
Maybe in time, this old heart of mine
Can learn to be free without you

[Verse 1]
How did it happen, when did we lose it
The love we looked for so long?
I'm sorry I called you, but it's the first night, you see
How does it feel to be free?

[Refrain]
I'm sorry I called you, but it's the first night, you see
Now how does it feel to be free?You might also like
