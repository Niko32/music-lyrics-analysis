I just want you as a friend
But you don't want understand
Don't you worry bout it
I bet you're gon' find a man
Cause everything that you do
Make me think that you want more
Ain't really good if you're keep doin' that
I'm holding myself back I don't a shit
I wanted you to hate me but you don't understandYou might also like
