All decked out and made up for T. V
Askin' for some money from God's people
Talkin' all that high theology
Well, I might be just an ol' blue collar
And there's things about the lord that I don't know
But I bet he never had a million dollars
Or wore a lot of stylish fancy clothes

Chorus
'cause Jesus was a country boy
Walkin' down a dirt road with everything that he owned
He never met a stranger
Born in a barn underneath the stars his mama layed him in a manger
Swimmin' in the river
Fishin' for his dinner
Livin' with the sinners like me
Makes me think that Jesus was a country boy
(Oh yes and I believe that Jesus was a country boy
2nd time only)

My daddy never cared much for religion
And my mama worried a lot about his soul
She's hit her knees and pray for him on Sunday
While daddy hit his favorite fishin' hole
You see daddy was a rebel and a rambler
But I always knew he loved my mama so
I never doubted he'd make it to heaven
'cause it's not who you are, it's who ya know
And daddy knew...
