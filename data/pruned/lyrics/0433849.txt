All you have to do is touch my hand
To show that you understand
And something happens to me that's some kind of wonderful

[Verse 1]
Every time my little world seems blue
I-I just have to look at you
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful

[Chorus]
I know I can't express this feeling of tenderness
There is so much I want to say but the right words won't come my way

[Verse 2]
I just know when I'm in your embrace
This world is a happy place
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
I just know when I'm in your embrace
Lord!, this world is a happy place
And everything seems to be some kind of wonderful
You might also like[Bridge]
Some kind of a soft love
Some kind of a warm love
Some kind of wonderful
Some kind of wonderful, yes, it is, I-I-I know

[Outro]
Say I know
