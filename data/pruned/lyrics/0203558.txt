But I'll be back tomorrow to play
And the strangels will take me
Down deep in their brine
The mischievous braingels
Down into the endless blue wine
I'll open my head and let out all of my time
I'd love to go drowning
And to stay and to stay
But the ocean doesn't want me today
I'll go in up to here, it can't possibly hurt
All they will find is my beer and my shirt
The riptide is raging and the lifeguard's away
But the ocean doesn't want me today
But the ocean doesn't want me today
The ocean doesn't want me todayYou might also like
