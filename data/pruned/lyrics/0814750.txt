Wondering what time you came to me
You broke my heart and left lonely
Now I got nothing left but misery

Wondering if you have found another love
Brings no consolation to my heart
Now one of these days you'll be sorry
(You know you will)
That you filled my heart with misery
(Let it swing)

One of these days you'll be sorry
That you filled my heart with misery
(Misery)You might also like
