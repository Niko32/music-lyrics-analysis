You're alone

The weary moon
From the night before
Sinks into the pit
Of dawn's gold door
The weary moon
It falls from view
The devil and I
Will follow you

He's alone
She's alone

And, whilst you think you've known me
For a very, very long time
You never hate
You never will
Be close to me
Or, mine

You're alone
We're alone
They're alone
They are all alone
You might also likeWe're all alone
So alone
Stone upon stone
