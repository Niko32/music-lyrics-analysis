Putting me through all this shit
Yeah I smoke and I do drink
Just to deal with all of this, all of this
Levitating towards the sky
And I know I'm on some shit
Top of my head feeling numb
Bitches all over my dick
Yeah I miss this feeling, yeah I miss this feeling
Yeah I miss this feeling, yeah I miss this feeling
Yeah I miss this feeling
Putting me through all this shit
Yeah you know that I smoke, I drink
Just to deal with the thought of this, all of this
And I know I'm on some shit
Top of my head feeling numb
This liquor so fun
Bitches on my dick
Yeah I miss this feeling

[Verse 1]
Said you love me but you lied
Now all them feelings between died
I think I should know, how to bullshit that you do
Cause of what I put you through, I put you through
Now I can't wait til these bitches know my name
Rubbin' on me, rubbin' all over my chain
Why leave my white T with stains
Girls acting like we got fame
I ain't got a dollar to my mothafuckin' name
Got a lot of bitches but I got no game
Not a big talker so I won't explain
Is it that strange, is it that strange
All the things you do leaving me so deranged
I can tell when you're lying from a far range
I'm guessing that some things just never change
They just never change, never change
You might also like[Chorus]
Putting me through all this shit
Yeah I smoke and I do drink
Just to deal with all of this, all of this
Levitating towards the sky
And I know I'm on some shit
Top of my head feeling numb
Bitches all over my dick
Yeah I miss this feeling, yeah I miss this feeling
Yeah I miss this feeling, yeah I miss this feeling
Yeah I miss this feeling
Putting me through all this shit
Yeah you know that I smoke, I drink
Just to deal with the thought of this, all of this
And I know I'm on some shit
Top of my head feeling numb
This liquor so fun
Bitches on my dick
Yeah I miss this feeling

[Verse 2]
Looks like I'm ready to die now
Party in this bitch til it dies out
Baby fuck cryin', beat your eyes out for me
Eyes all red from the white cloud
All that smoke give you dry mouth
I'ma wait it up like right now, that's on me
See me I'm back, baby don't get me started
My mind has departed, except for shit be started
I'm just tryna figure out exactly where your heart is
Tryna act like you don't care, you're tryin' your hardest
You think I believe it baby come on let's be honest
I'm just tryna get it girl, tell me where you want it
Quit being so modest, you know you're a goddess
Got it if you want it, baby no problem
I'm all in, baby girl I'm all in
Said she wanna go drink, baby girl I'm all in
Baby girl stop it, just be honest
Baby girl why don't you stop being modest
Baby girl cause you know you're a goddess
Baby girl cause you know you're a goddess
Got it
[Outro]
I haven't smoked in so long
I haven't drank in so long
I haven't fucked in so long
I haven't partied so long
I haven't smoked in so long
Yeah I miss this feeling
