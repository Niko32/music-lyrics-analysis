Don't tell me hard luck stories
And I won't tell you mine
Don't tell me hard luck stories
And I won't, won't tell you mine

[Verse 1]
Every time you're feeling fine
Got another good one on the line
It slips away, you feel it slip away, slip away
I don't want no more from you
Won't do what you want me to
Turn me loose
Come on turn me loose, turn me loose
Every time I'm feeling good
The phone rings and I knock on wood
Hoping that it won't be you
Calling like you always do
All you ever seem to say
Is how much bad luck came your way
You won't try to start again
You just count on your old friends

[Chorus]
Don't tell me hard luck stories
And I won't tell you mine
Don't tell me hard luck stories
And I won't, won't tell you mine
You might also like[Verse 2]
Now you call up every day
Got no money, no place to stay
That girl made a mess of you
You got what was comin', too
Build her up and let her down
Tasting everything in town
Treat her right, you never treat her right, treat her right
Now she's gone and you're alone
Bite your fingers to the bone
Slip away, you feel it slip away, slip away
You don't know what's going on
How you lost it, what went wrong
Whatever happened to the good love that you once knew?

[Chorus]
Don't tell me hard luck stories
And I won't tell you mine
Don't tell me hard luck stories
And I won't, won't tell you mine
