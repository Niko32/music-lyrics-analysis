And the bottle won't leave my hand
I needed help with the same decision girl, it's killing me
Knowing i'll never see you again
And as I sit here thinking bout what went wrong
The radio just plays some sad love songs. Was it my mistake again?

Cause every night night night
They'll be talking they'll be talking
Every night night night
They'll be walking they'll be walking
And every night night night
I lay awake in bed
Cause every night night night
They'll be talking they'll be talking
Every night night night
They'll be walking they'll be walking
And every night night night
I lay awake in bed

I was ignoring it when it all began
And to this day I haven't seen an end
I've got no reason to carry on
That's why i'm leaving today
And as i sit here thinking bout what went wrong
The radio just plays some sad love songs
Was it my mistake again??

(Womans Voice On Answering Machine:) Hey it's me, I was just
Calling to let you know it's over. Don't bother calling me cause
I never wanna see you again. And if you see me on the street
Walk the other way because...I don't know you anymore

Cause every night night night
They'll be talking they'll be talking
Every night night night
They'll be walking they'll be walking
And every night night night
I lay awake in bed

They'll be talking they'll be talking
Every night night night
They'll be walking they'll be walking
And every night night night
I lay awake in bed
