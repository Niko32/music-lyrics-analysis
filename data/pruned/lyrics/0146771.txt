I could never be ya boyfriend
Cuz you know I gotta special girl
And I could never be ya husband
But that don't mean you still don't rock my world
And I can you take you to an island
We can be there just the two of us
God I love to see you smiling
All I ask is that you keep it hushed

[Chorus]
Be my number 2
Girl I love you
Be my number 2
Girl I need you
Be my number 2
Girl you're so fine (so fine)
Be my number 2
But you will never be my number 1
My number 1, my number 1, my number 1...

[Verse 2]
I could take you out to dinner
But there's a couple places we won't go
Cuz number 1 is a beginner
And there's a couple things that she don't know
So I can take you to a hotel
We can be there just the two of us
Gurl I love you cuz you don't tell
Nd you know how to keep it hush hush
You might also like[Chorus]
Be my number 2
Girl I love you
Be my number 2
Girl I need you
Be my number 2
Girl you're so fine (so fine)
Be my number 2
But you will never be my number 1
My number 1, my number 1, my number 1...

[Hook]
The way you give it to me
I gotta have it (have it)
Cuz shes ma beauty queen
And your ma have it (haa--aave it)
So baby.....

[Chorus]
Be my number 2
Girl I love you
Be my number 2
Girl I need you
Be my number 2
Girl you're so fine (so fine)
Be my number 2
But you will never be my number 1
My number 1, my number 1, my number 1...
