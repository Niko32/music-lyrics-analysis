She was dancing, she was smiling
Roses blooming in her cheeks
In a quiet kind of litany
She accepted some defeat
And then she twirled into the arms
Of disgrace, and then repelled
Now, she's fallen to her knees
But you couldn't ever tell

[Pre-Chorus]
And then, she asked me how we got here
I told her, "I don't know!"
And if you keep on asking
I'll just keep saying so
This isn't what I wanted
It isn't what you need
But let them keep on talking
Just calm yourself and breathe

[Chorus]
Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now, don't you pay them any mind
You might also like[Verse 2]
Where the burdens of her mother
Weigh like sandbags on the eyes
As she closes, just to open
As the sirens whirling by
And now she's off to tell a secret
To a friend somewhere in town
And her friend just takes a moment
And asks why I'm not around

Darling, this is something
I should have told you long ago
I just want you to feel safe
I just want to make you glow
Oh, how you glowed when we were young
There was nothing on our minds
When you jump for your love
Baby, you're nothing long of time

[Pre-Chorus]
And then, she asked me how we got here
I told her, "I don't know!"
And if you keep on asking
I'll just keep saying so
This isn't what I wanted
It isn't what you need
But let them keep on talking
Just calm yourself and pay
[Chorus]
Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now, don't you pay them any mind

[Bridge]
Why do we have to go through this every time?

Some days you hear it (don't listen, I'll carry you)
Some days you don't (don't listen, oh no)
Sometimes you feel it (it's not worth it, help me)
Sometimes you won't

[Pre-Chorus]
Just calm yourself and breathe

[Chorus]
Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now, don't you pay them any mind

Don't you pay them any mind
Don't you pay them any mind
You know this happens every time
Now, don't you pay them any mind
