I saw the gates of hell, invert the cross
Saw the devil rise, getting stoned, tossing rocks
I never saw the passion, till it came with all panic
And the meaning of life, ain't nice but fantastic
The preachers all preach but the bastards won't listen
Laughters all weak from the beating in the kitchen
That fucking fool, he's lost it all, now he's dead
Or at least he really wants to be with demons in his head
And the sheets are all red, "from what" thats foul play
Even the dumb ass kids on earth can get laid
Hold her down, tight her up, god damn enraged
I fucking hate this rape nation, and the place that we made
I'm hate pedophiles, sickos, i'm watching rapists
And they should watch out before i start my hating
I'm naming off names, to help us out, whats up
We got another little problem, and it's spiked in our cups

Girl, drink down your loneliness and open up your soul a bit
Sober's overrated when compared to total bliss
Let the opiates take hold of you below the wrist
And show you this is home before the moment when the coma hits
Cold and stiff as the oceans of a polar shift
Ownership disintegrating to a broken grip
As you unknowingly bestow the gift of self
No kiss and tell, be well, existing with this administered hell

People are so dumb, never trust anyone
Never leave your self alone with men just to have fun
We're all different, you and i, me and him
Me and her shared a heart, that died when he sinned
We found a whole new world, of nightmares
Under the stair is the body but who cares
In the back room, with a screaming monsoon
Is a kidnapped girl named jane from cancan
Will she die soon, i hope not before noon
I need to save her life before she meets her very own doom
Even cops in my town get it on with kids
It ain't nothing to front from that's typical shit
My visions on, it leads me to the creeps i hate
I find myself face to face on a goose chase
I knock him out, now the predators drowned in mace
Without a doubt, he goes to jail where he's getting raped

Dude, put on your dominance to conquer you a model chick
Plop the drink and shower with compliments till she's out of it
Contradict your shouts of living honest for a power trip
Sour milk counterfeit, a solid piece of polished shit
Embodiment of rotting grit with a modern twist
A monument to a bottomless intolerance
If god exists, then he's gawking at this comic strip
Of awkwardness and anguish and of heinousness and cowardice
