Everybody's girl
What’s the point in bein' everybody's girl?
Maybe you think that way there’s no chance gettin' hurt
Livin' for no one costs me way more than it's worth

[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
So you're gonna be a singer
Well, I'll be, goddamn
You're as pretty as a post card
No thanks to the old man
It's the same coat I had on
The night that I went in
I can stay an hour at Canter’s
The streets cool off by then
When can I see you again?

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey]
Everything you want
What’s the fun in gettin' everything you want?
I wouldn’t know, but look, baby, you should try
Forget that lefty shit your mom drilled in your mind
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
Give the world a new savior
Sell his pictures to the press
Buy a place out in the country
Leave this world for someone else
My destruction is an hour late
I'm at Buddy's Rendezvous
Tellin' the losers and old timers
How good I did with you
They almost believe me, too

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty]
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Ah-ha, ah-ha
Whatever happened to the girl I knew?
In the wasteland, come up short and end up on the news
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Outro: Lana Del Rey & Father John Misty]
Whatever happened?
Whatever happened?
