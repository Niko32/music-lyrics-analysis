Last Friday night, they're down at the roadhouse
Booth in the back, they sat alone
Holding hands like two young lovers
Her hair was grey, his hair was gone

[Verse 2]
She said to him "I'm getting older
A pretty girl, no more to be
Heaven knows I'm not a treasure"
He softly said "you are to me"

[Chorus 1]
"You are to me a girl in springtime
The one I met so long ago
A moment captured for a lifetime
That's what I see you are to me"

[Solo]

[Verse 3]
He said to her "my work is done now
And all that's left are memories
Heaven knows, I'm not important"
She softly said "you are to me"
You might also like[Chorus 2]
"You are to me a boy in springtime
The one I met so long ago
A moment captured for a lifetime
That's what I see you are to me
That's what I see you are to me

[Outro]
Last Friday night, they're down at the roadhouse...
