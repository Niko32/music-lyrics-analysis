And I'm waiting in this messed up town
Hesitating, is it too late now?
Well, this one's for the broken hearted

Red lights on an empty street
Deep into the night, it's just you and me
And we just might make some history
Well, shut up then, let's get it started

Now we can live it up
'Cause we don't care about anyone
The hats are fine
There's no generation like our generation now

Got it, the sun comes up
We're sending the word far and wide
Take some chance
There's no generation like our generation now

Well, we talk about flour and we're all strung out
Yeah, we're crazy in this fucked up town
And I'm hazy, yeah, I'm coming down
And believe me, I'm just getting started

Listen, let the music play
While we're pissing every night away
Our wishing it will stay this way
This one's for our dear departed

There's no generation like our generation now

Got it, the sun comes up
We're sending the word far and wide
Take some chance
There's no generation like our generation now

No generation like our generation
It's no generation like our generation
It's no generation like our generation
It's no generation like our generation

Now we can live it up
'Cause we don't care about anyone
The hats are fine
There's no generation like our generation now

Got it, the sun comes up
We're sending the word far and wide
Take some chance
There's no generation like our generation now
