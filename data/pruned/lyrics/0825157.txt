It's official, y'all, we back again
Let's take it all the way, wanna make it all the way, ha
Acey Duecy and Algebra, alright
Yo, let's do it, y-y-y-yeah

[Verse 1: Anthony David & Algebra]
Can you tell me what I feel?
All I know is what I'm feeling is real
When you're around time stands still
You get me to the tip of my heels
And I know that we're fly and we're young
Not too young to be fly and in love
When I look in your eyes I can tell you're the one, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony David, Algebra, Both]
They'll never know, all the things that I know
They'll never know, we're so incredible
They'll never know just how far that I would go
They might doubt, but they gon' find out

[Chorus: Anthony David & Algebra]
Let's make this official you get all my hugs and kisses
This love is a business and with you I know I'm winnin'
Let's make this official and this world could be our witness
Only the beginnin' and with you I know I'm winnin'
You might also like[Verse 2: Anthony David & Algebra]
Can't describe what I feel
But I know that this feeling is real
Extraordinary love times ten
Forever racin' the beginnin' of bliss
Know we're young and we're still havin' fun
So our love will be fun and be young
When I look in your eyes I can tell you're the one

[Pre-Chorus: Anthony David, Algebra, Both]
They'll never know, the things that I know
They'll never know, we're so compatible
They'll never know, that our love's not just fo' show
They don't now, but they gon' find out

[Chorus: Anthony David & Algebra]
Let's make this official you get all my hugs and kisses
This love is a business and with you I know I'm winnin'
Let's make this official and this world could be our witness
Only the beginnin' and with you I know I'm winnin'

[Bridge: Anthony David, Algebra, Both]
When you wrap your arms around me
So deep in your love I'm drowning
When you wrap your arms around me
Deeper in your love I'm falling, yeah
I swear I never, ever felt like this
I feel the magic every time we kiss
And let our witness be the whole world
So we can make it official, yeah
[Chorus: Anthony David & Algebra]
Let's make this official you get all my hugs and kisses
This love is a business and with you I know I'm winnin'
Let's make this official and this world could be our witness
Only the beginnin' and with you I know I'm winnin'
