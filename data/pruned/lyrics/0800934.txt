Hmm, baby
Hmm
Yeah

[Verse 1]
There was a time when I adored you
But I was too blind in love to see
That it wasn't we, it was only me
Giving in to every word that you said

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm loving you but my heart can't pretend
When your feelings just haven't been there

[Chorus]
So if you want to go, I won't follow you
I guess I'm not the one to make your dreams come true
If you want my love, I gotta let you go
'Cause your lovin' is the deepest hurt of all
(Hmm, baby)

[Verse 2]
Where was the life we had before, yeah?
There was a place in your heart I could call home
Now I find my place has gone to somebody else
I'll let you go cause I can't take no more
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm loving you but my heart can't pretend
When your feelings just haven't been there

[Chorus]
So if you want to go, I won't follow you (I won't follow you)
I guess I'm not the one to make your dreams come true
If you want my love, I gotta let you go (Oh, let you go)
'Cause your lovin' is the deepest hurt of all

[Bridge]
Oh, sometimes in life
Things don't work out right
Thought I was meant for you
Oh, if I could find a way to turn back time
I would make it so that every day, in every way
You still could be mine

[Break]
Hmm, baby
La-da-da, la-da-da-dah
Hmm
Love is the deepest hurt
Lovin' is the deepest hurt
Oh
[Chorus]
So if you want to go, I won't follow you (I won't follow you)
I guess I'm not the one to make your dreams come true
If you want my love, I gotta let you go
'Cause your lovin' is the deepest hurt of all (Your lovin' is the deepest hurt of all)
So if you want to go, I won't follow you (Your lovin' is)
I guess I'm not the one to make your dreams come true (The deepest hurt of all)
If you want my love, I gotta let you go (The deepest hurt of all)
'Cause your lovin' is the deepest hurt of all (Your lovin' is the deepest hurt of all)

[Outro]
So if you want to go, then I won't follow you
I guess I'm not the one to make your dreams come true
And if you want my love, I gotta let you know
'Cause your lovin' is the deepest hurt of all, oh
Love is the deepest hurt
Lovin' is the deepest hurt
