You were kidding yourself
And you decided the love you'd been resisting
Had only your best interests in mind
Would you look at yourself in the mirror and try
To restore your illusions with lies
Or would you sit like you do sometimes
In the kitchen and smile

What if just like everyone else
You were fooling yourself all along
And what you had believed would be right turned out to be so wrong

Ooh, just like everyone else, just like everyone else
Just like everyone else

But how come every time I go inside
I've got to be so scared
It seems almost as if every time I close my eyes I disappear
If I remember correctly I meant to repent it
Forget it directly and get some professional help

What if just like everyone else
I've be fooling myself all along
And that which I perceived to be weak turned out to be so strong
You might also likeOoh, just like everyone else, just like everyone else
Just like everyone else

Ooh, just like everyone else, just like everyone else
Just like everyone else
