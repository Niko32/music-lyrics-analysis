At night I hear it creeping
At night I feel it move
I'll never sleep here anymore
I wish you never told me
I wish I never knew
I wake up screaming
It's all because of you

[Pre-Chorus]
So real these voices in my head
When it comes back you won't be

[Chorus]
Scared and lonely
You won't be scared
You won't be
You won't be scared and lonely
You won't be scared
You won't be lonely

[Verse 2]
I know there's something out there
I think I hear it move
I've never felt like this before
I wish you never told me
I wish I never knew
I wake up screaming
It's all because of you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So real these voices in my head
When it comes back you won't be

[Chorus]
Scared and lonely
You won't be scared
You won't be
You won't be scared and lonely
You won't be scared
You won't be lonely

[Bridge]
It's all because of you
I wish you never told me
I wake up screaming now
So real these voices in my head
So real these voices in my head
I wake up screaming now
I wish you never told me
I wish I never knew

[Chorus]
Scared and lonely
You won't be scared
You won't be
You won't be scared and lonely
You won't be scared
You won't be lonely
Scared and lonely
You won't be scared
You won't be
You won't be scared and lonely
You won't be scared
You won't be lonely
