I feel you over my shoulder
Whatever I do
And now I know what everyone knows
My family and friends always hated you
Say you got your reasons
To mess with my freedom

[Bridge]
Might as well roll up in black and white
Flashing lights
You know I'm right
Cause that's how you treat me
Like you're the police

[Hook]
I try to not try but I'm not getting through
And who do I call when my problem is you
Every time I need saving it's always from you
Every time I try to change it
You cuff me like police
You lock me up and throw the key
You cuff me like police
Well over my dead body babe

[Verse 2]
Always on my ass about something
Never satisfied
You stole my money, my gun
Am I guilty or are you the liar
How do you sleep at night
Knowing the things that you do
You might also like
[Bridge]
