Watched them sink into oblivion
We've all seen the damage done
Watched you slip into oblivion

So at the end of your days
Where will you go
When your kingdom's gone
Worms cover you throne when the lights go out
And the clock strikes twelve

There will be no mercy
'cause none was ever shown
Now behold what you reap
Is only what you've sown

Sink into oblivion

So at the end of your days
Where will you go
When your kingdom's gone
Worms cover your throne when the clock strikes twelve
And the lights go outYou might also like
