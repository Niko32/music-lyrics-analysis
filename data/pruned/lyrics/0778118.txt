Well here come crazy Katie
With her skirt jacked up real high
She said let's get out of here
Really do this thing right
I'd rather be in a honky tonk tonight

Somebody started riding that bull
And that's what set the pace
Shots slamming led to booty dancing
With every loser in that place
We all got a little fearless
Then the band got loud
It was all thump thump so Katie got up started workin' the crowd
It was a flirtin' with trouble losin' your mind
Country crunkin' hellagood time
Saturday night situation

Well it got a little ugly around midnight
We looked around and found Katie dancing with two guys at a time
I knew what would happen next and then somebody started swingin'
How'd we wind up here again

Somebody started riding that bull
And that's what set the pace
Shots slamming led to booty dancing
With every loser in that place
We all got a little fearless
Then the band got loud
It was all thump thump so Katie got up started workin' the crowd
It was a flirtin' with trouble losin' your mind
Country crunkin' hellagood time
Saturday night situation

We were just gonna come in here
Have a good time
And nobody was gonna get hurt
Yeah, yeah
