This is the mourning after
What I hafta say with little laughter
This is the mourning after
When it’s me, you passed and the pastor

One minute you’re here the next one you’re gone
We at the wake wonderin’ what’s going on
Most of them folk cryin’ till dawn word is bond
My mind blank Thank God I’m truly whole
Feelin’ this calm wind goin’ through my soul
Weird role ‘cuz I’m in total control
Watchin’ all this shit unfold (Watchin’ my life unfold)
Like I’m not even here I have no fear
K-9 bites couldn’t be more clear
Clearer would be a chest heavin’ and sobbin’
Stoppin’ too grim reaper done robbed ‘em
Near Hachiko yo with my feel akimbo
Gray clouds are rain and no cymbals
Feels like a kick from Daniel Dae Kim yo
Yo this leaves me in limbo although
Bro, people gonna die around me yo


This is the mourning after
What I hafta say with little laughter
This is the mourning after
When it’s me, you passed and the pastor
You might also likeI ain’t got no tears then I gotta pen
You know I lost the plot I never did listen
Wrote this for my ken and kin when
This LSD reality hooked me to my playpen
Amen is not enough to rid this carcinogen
Lookin’ down at a bottle the world’s dead
Blocks where darkness’s hell lead instead
It had to happen again
Sad days is what it’s been
All in a morass you were shut in
It was so much more light
Aight I was young we had to fight
Lookin’ back it wasn’t too bright
They called me, told me: he died last night
So many might go,  call this side blight
Feelings to fight I express turned plight
Now finally you’re alright you’re outasight
No worries as your soul took flight

This is the mourning after

This is the mourning after
What I hafta say with little laughter
This is the mourning after
When it’s me, you passed and the pastor
This is the mourning after
What I hafta say with little laughter
This is the mourning after
When it’s me, you passed and the pastor
You only pass this way a little ways
Praise I disobey chaos. Anarchy can stay
Pray is the most I could say
Moments of peace’s mainstay may sway
Okay is the answer to the momentary lie
Close the door of my room to cry
Rose at four to scream at the sky
Lost some high
Some others should have died
We should have tried
Read the words of the eulogy to sigh
Their voices choices fallen on deaf ears
My mind filled up with tsunamis of tears
All my acts hurricanes fallin’ off plain insane
This deep weight of pain itchin up my vein
Shares of players pain delayers false airs
Am I the only one who cares…  

Trusting no one these days
Dude that’s just a damn haze
Lost a generation to this heat
Lost emancipation to some heat
My words to you were incomplete
Threw in the towel my cypher’s incomplete
I’m my own shook no more teats
Soldier broke pickin’ butts offa street
I’m frozen numb like winter’s concrete
All people turn dumb for some reason
Watchin’ my life turn to crumbs
Some won
My heart’s on the run if I overcome
Ho hum is every second I spent spend
Hallowed out wish the stratosphere would rend
This is the mourning after
This chapter Times with no laughter
Friendship’s so far evaded hard to capture
These waves of loss it’s all gone dross
It’s all been tossed like floss embossed
Rhyme I spit I never quit
You took your last breath last tackle last hit
You ghost That’s it
Rest in peace
This is the mourning after
What I hafta say with little laughter
This is the mourning after
When it’s me, you passed and the pastor
This is the mourning after
What I hafta say with little laughter
This is the mourning after
When it’s me, you passed and the pastor

This is the mourning after
What I hafta say with little laughter
This is the mourning after
When it’s me, you passed and the pastor
This is the mourning after
What I hafta say with little laughter
This is the mourning after
When it’s me, you passed and the pastor
