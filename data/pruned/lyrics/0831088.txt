Taking my clothes, walking out the door
Tired of your games, tired of your show
You want it your way
Always got something to say
As much as its hurting me
I'm on a one way street ( see me walking )

[Chorus: Avant & Charlie Wilson]
Walking on, on a one way street
All alone on this one way street
Nowhere to go on this one way street
Tired of being lonely
Walking on, on a one way street
All alone on this one way street
Nowhere to go on this one way street
Tired of being lonely

[Verse 2: Charlie Wilson]
Whoo oh whoo, stop, dont move
Man let me talk to you
There's rules to the game, ( the game )
What you do comes back to you
You better better wait turn around
And put your bags back down
Your love runs too deep
And there ain't nothin' good on a one way street
You might also like[Chorus: Avant & Charlie Wilson]
Walking on, on a one way street
All alone on this one way street
Nowhere to go on this one way street
Tired of being lonely
Walking on, on a one way street
All alone on this one way street
Nowhere to go on this one way street
Tired of being lonely

[Bridge: Avant (Charlie Wilson)]
You see she hurt me (but what did you do)
I tried to be fair (but you were never there)
So I'm walking away (man you better stay)
(You got a good good girl don't you let her get away, no)
I tried my best to make it work
I fed her candy she fed me dirt
(I been down this road too many times)
(If you don't want no trouble you better change your mind)

[Chorus: Avant & Charlie Wilson]
Walking on, on a one way street
All alone on this one way street
Nowhere to go on this one way street
Tired of being lonely
Walking on, on a one way street
All alone on this one way street
Nowhere to go on this one way street
Tired of being lonely
Walking on, on a one way street
All alone on this one way street
Nowhere to go on this one way street
Tired of being lonely
