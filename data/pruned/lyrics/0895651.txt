Through the darkness of Greenland to the islands of Japan
I've met with many people, all kinds of them you see
But I'd rather have America my homeland where I'm free
I've seen the hot Pacific, the ocean wide and deep
I've been in old Korea with its mud up to my knees
I've walked the streets of China, seen all there is to see
But I'd rather have America my homeland where I'm free
I've sailed the wide Atlantic to France and Germany
The beauty there in Paris just didn't mean a thing to me
I made my way to England and on to Italy
'Cause I'd rather have America my homeland where I'm free
And Iceland have its icy cliffs and forty-five below
And Greenland keep its darkness and the freezin' winds that blow
Don't put me off in China or Korea's muddy land
Let Paris keep her beauty and the islands of Japan
I don't want Germany or France or Italy
I'd rather have America my homeland where I'm free
