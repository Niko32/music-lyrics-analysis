A-one, two, three

[Verse 1]
My brain, my fingers
Bought bottles in a package place
Got caught up on a park bench
Everybody tried to get a taste

[Pre-Chorus]
When the sun goes down I swear to God
They'll try to run you out of this town, and they will beat you down

[Chorus]
They will beat you down if you stay around
You're gonna get shot down, they will beat you down
They will beat you down and you'll feel like a
Hungry dog in the street on a very short leash

[Verse 2]
My heart is a cancer
Radiation wouldn't help a thing
My God doesn't answer
Pray nightly every single week

[Pre-Chorus]
When the liquor runs low
My friends run low, got nowhere to go
You might also like[Chorus]
Nowhere to go
No religion could ever save my soul, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go, and I feel like a
Hungry dog in the street on a very short leash
