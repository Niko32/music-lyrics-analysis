And this day is a lie

Throwing pennies at the hit parade

The concrete will shine

Or better yet let's make it ticker-tape

I will dress you in white

There's cracks in your ivory from this

Weather pattern

There's cracks in you i can see from this

Goddamn makeup

Aging so gracefully with the help of your fashion orderly

And you got under my skin, again

You'll soon find that someone somewhere everywhere
You might also likeWill get theirs

You'll soon find that someone somewhere everywhere

Will get theirs

Uh uh oh uh uh oh uh uh oh uh uh oh

There's cracks in your ivory from this

Weather pattern

There's cracks in you i can see from this

Goddamn makeup

Aging so gracefully with the help of your plastic surgery

And you got under my skin, again

Aging so goddamn beautifully cause you paid for it

I hope it fits, i hope it fits
