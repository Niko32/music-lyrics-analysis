You are in my dream, so easy and free
Stay here with me
Passing like a cloud, rain down on me
Let the bottom fall out

[Bridge]
Out of nowhere

[Vers 2]
I'll wait, who can tell, Heaven's pass√©
But not today
Met you secretly, by the water and waves
When I was a sleep

[Bridge]
Out of nowhere

[Vers 3]
Drowsy, oh no not again, keep me awake
It never ends
Slow days, innocent A's, move like the leaves
That rise in your breeze

[Bridge]
