Looking at a black page, with lines on 'em
Script unwritten of fortune, ironed on 'em
As if a fresh set of lives we designed on 'em
Where my hopes jockey for space, they ride on 'em
How many times has the ink gotta cover it
Before I'm satisfied by what I come up with
You don't need me to feed you the cookie cutter shit
Just a heart that's bleeding when you discover it
Friend and a foe, pen and a page
Ay yo a piece of paper can never be set in its ways
But until I bring it to life it's end of my days
I'm making my bed a maze in my head
It's why I don't rap about wealth
You could want it so much that your brain melts
A corporate conveyor belt? That ain't me nor Delts
I only ever wrote music that was true to myself

[Chorus Delta & Urthboy]
Every slate is clean to me
Cos I'll be rhyming and shining frequently
And from what I know now what would I change
Unputdownable, every turned page is a clean slate
Every slate is clean to me
Cos I'll be rhyming and shining frequently
And from what I know now what would I change
Unputdownable, every turned page is a clean slate

(Transmitting live from Smokey's Haunt)
Each day when I wake I'm living out my fate
Diggin' a nice crate, writtens that I state
And delivered to the plate, turned gentleman primates
Why hate Benjamin for hitting the prime slate
High grade numbers invade, made the verse toy
Not arrogant we stay down to Urthboy
Mainstream is a mess, leaving a dirt void
The Herd murder joints with reverb noise
The suburbs poised the blow, don't call triple 0
Wrote a message in the smoke saying "bro let it go"
Till nuclear winter snow snap froze the globe
My rap chose the road less travelled for dough
Immaculate road, mansion home matching the green
Same eggplant y'all different aubergine
You jealousy fiends, my team all hate the scene
So we do our own thing, wipe the slate clean

[Chorus Delta & Urthboy]
Every slate is clean to me
Cos I'll be rhyming and shining frequently
And from what I know now what would I change
Unputdownable, every turned page is a clean slate
Every slate is clean to me
Cos I'll be rhyming and shining frequently
And from what I know now what would I change
Unputdownable, every turned page is a clean slate
[Verse 3 Urthboy & Delta]
Through binoculars his eyes looked timid (yikes)
Focused out beyond city limits
He was told the other side it lies infinite
Not a second to lose, cos no one gains a minute
Every point in the path is there to pivot
Every cast got a character that think they got it figured
Lost souls at the crossroads being delivered
Oasis in the palm of your hands the sand shifted
Heat haze tricks on the brain remain lifted
Prepare yourself for the Alien visit
Watch how you take each step can slide different
Every rhyme that's written's a slate of white linen

[Chorus Delta & Urthboy]
Every slate is clean to me
Cos I'll be rhyming and shining frequently
And from what I know now what would I change
Unputdownable, every turned page is a clean slate
Every slate is clean to me
Cos I'll be rhyming and shining frequently
And from what I know now what would I change
Unputdownable, every turned page is a clean slate
