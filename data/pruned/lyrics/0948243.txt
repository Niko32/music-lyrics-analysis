Come on

[Verse 1]
Stand before the line
Stand before the line
Freed through emotions of greed
Stand before the line
Stand before the line of fear
Stand before the line
Stand before the line of fear

[Chorus]
Cold at heart, cold in mind
Every night a different sky
You and me, finally
Shall we dance to eternity?

[Post-Chorus]
Shall we dance?
Shall we dance to the morning light?
Shall we dance?
Shall we dance to the morning light?
To the morning

[Refrain]
I break the ice and time stands still
I overcome the iron will
Embrace the floods inside of me
The flowing waters set me free

[Bridge]
Come on now

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
I break the ice and time stands still
I overcome the iron will
Embrace the floods inside of me
The flowing waters set me free
I break the ice and time stands still
I overcome the iron will
Embrace the floods inside of me
The flowing waters set me free

[Outro]
So the morning, so the morning comes
(Shall we dance?...) To the morning light?
