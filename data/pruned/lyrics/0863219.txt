Help me play this song
Spend another night inside this rented mansion
I love you now
I know that doesn't matter
I love you now
I know that doesn't matter

Kissing me full of beer, tequila, weed and candy
Walking down the boardwalk
Act like we were married
You always made it easy
Then I'd want you more
You always kept it easy
Then I'd want you more

Too smart for your own good
Too sweet, too logical
Statistics round your head
Tried to teach me about baseball
My favourite was the part when they make it home
I like it when they steal, and when they make it home

You left us with a sorrow too unreal to help
Heard the birds sound broadcasts speakers at the Phoenix hotel
All your friends are standing, crying, on the sidewalk
All your boyfriends, they were standing crying on the sidewalk
You might also likeBreezy, I feel dizzy
Can you help me up?
It's crowded at the backdoor
How we getting to the bus?
I'd like to help you find it if there's something better
Yeah, I'll try and help you find it if there's something better

Move your slender fingers
Help me play this song
Spend another night inside this practice mansion
I love you now
I know that's all that matters
I love you now
And I know that's all that matters
