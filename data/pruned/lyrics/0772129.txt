It might be your smile
'Cause it can change my day
Blue eyes that chase my blues away
It might be your touch
That keeps me coming back for more
Her loving words that keep me going strong
That heart of hers I hang my future on
What it is, well, I can't say for sure

[Chorus]
It's just she's got this thing about her
She's got this thing about her
Like the magic in your favorite song
You just can't put your finger on
In her arms when we're all alone
I get the feeling that I've come back home
She's got this thing about her

[Verse 2]
She stops time when she moves through a room
When she leaves, she's always gone too soon
And I'm counting down the minutes 'til she's back
She's the love I've known eternally
It always feels brand new to me
I can't separate the fiction from the fact
You might also like[Chorus]
It's just she's got this thing about her
She's got this thing about her
Like a hymn in a cathedral hall
Watching April snowflakes fall
In her arms when we're all alone
I get the feeling that I come back home
She's got this thing about her

[Outro]
Like the magic in your favorite song
You just can't put your finger on
She's got this thing about her
