I got a hundred dollars smoking in my billfold
I know I ought to save it but it's burning a hole
Right through my pocket and into my skin
Come Monday morning I'll be broke again

[Chorus]
It's finally Friday, I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday, I'm out of control
Forget the working blues and let the good times roll

[Verse 2]
I got a little sugar baby down the road
She's sitting on a radio and rocking on roll
We'll dance up a storm and later all night
We'll be working on doing all the wrong things right

[Chorus]
It's finally Friday, I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday, I'm out of control
Forget the working blues and let the good times roll

[Bridge]
Monday, I'll be hurting with my head in a vice
Tuesday, I'll be wondering if I'll ever survive
Wednesday and Thursday, I'll be slowly tuning in
Friday, I'll be revving up my motor again
You might also like[Chorus]
It's finally Friday, I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday, I'm out of control
Forget the working blues and let the good times roll
It's finally Friday, I'm free again
I got my motor running for a wild weekend
It's finally Friday, I'm out of control
Forget the working blues and let the good times roll
