[Hook x2]
Who be getting all the guap? Yung Smuggaz
Stunting on them old heads, Yung Smuggaz
Getting fucked up, go to work, Yung Smuggaz
Cause some old charging, now you got no [?]

[Verse 1]
Sasne that's the Smug Way, get fucked up like all day
Then we go and get that money when the demon play
Who the fuck said crime don't pay? Smug ain't hard?
Get you pay in one, that's crazy, ask me if you don't believe me
1000 pounds in midget and 500 in babies, 50 000 in cases
Doing all this numbers, don't wanna cut no cases
Smug Mang, Smug God, all about them faces
Yung Smugga moving lot of different places
Smug Mang, Smug God, all about them faces
Yung Smuggaz moving all different places
Moving all different places

[Hook x2]

[Verse 2]
Yung Smuggaz on the border, been taking orders
Live, pick-up or delivery we charching fee
You get 500 or more, you get two for free
You want paper down homie, that's more for me
Ye-yellow Xans mixed with codeine in the Sunny D
And she just loved that molly white girl and ecstasy
I can't tell her best friend if she want me, yes she want the D
Wait a second, I'm only with one bitch, must be the LSD
Yung Smugga going crazy, what you mean? What you need?
What you cartel or fiend, Sasne be a gangsta dream
Cooling with the Smug Team, rolling off a bean
Bitch I might be and I'm Smug Rich, don't care so don't try me
