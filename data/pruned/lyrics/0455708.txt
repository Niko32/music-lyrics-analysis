I need you here beside me
To chase the night away
I need your love to guide me
Safe through another day
I lie and watch the lights go down
Say goodnight to another town

[Pre-Chorus]
And though it hurts
To be alone
I have my thoughts of you
To keep me warm

[Chorus]
In the afterglow of your love
Dreams all I'm guilty of
Every day I'm playing tough
But read my mind
If you could see me now
Living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now
The me that only you would know
Still burning in the afterglow

[Verse 2]
When the beat of the drum has faded
The show comes to an end
The stage is clear and loaded
And the highway calls again
I stand and watch the lights go down
You might also like[Chorus]
In the afterglow of your love
Dreams all I'm guilty of
Every day I'm playing tough
But read my mind
If you could see me now
Just living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now
Still burning in the afterglow

[Bridge]
Hmm, hmm
Stay with me right to the end
Hmm, hmm
Till I can hold you again
Hmm, hmm, hmm

[Chorus]
If you could see me now
Just living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now
I'm still burning in the afterglow
(If you could see me now)
Oh, I'm just living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now
[Outro]
Still burning, still burning, still burning
(If you could see me now)
Just living my life in a limbo
If you could see me now
I'm still burning in the afterglow
