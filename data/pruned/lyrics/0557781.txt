Bad ass decisions made
From a fear of being alone
All by myself again
Sitting in the den
And looking at the phone as if it owes

Owes me a favor
As I reverse my earlier
Making of a king-sized bed
And as a queen without a king
Now I realize

[Chorus:]
I'd rather sleep in the middle
Middle of my bed
Alone and not hurting over you

That's better than sleeping
On the side crying at night
Silently watching you sleep
I'd rather sleep in the middle

[Verse 2:]
Now you think I'm jealous of her
But she's probably jealous of me
Because I'm free
You might also likeI am free of you
I know you're crazy about her
And you'll continue to be
Until she falls deep in love with you

[Pre-Chorus:]
'Cause it pleases you to
Love someone who don't love you
It's the getting
Not the having that pleases you

[Chorus:]
I'd rather sleep in the middle
(I'd rather)
Middle of my bed
(In the middle of my bed, yeah)

Alone and not hurting over you
(I'm not gonna hurt, baby, no)
That's better than
Sleeping on the side crying at night (Oh)
Silently watching you sleep
I'd rather sleep in the middle

[Pre-Chorus:]
'Cause it pleases you to love
Someone who don't love you
It's the getting
Not the having that pleases
You!
[Chorus:]
(I'd rather sleep in the middle)

I'd rather sleep in the middle
Middle of my bed
(Middle of my bed)
Alone and not hurting over you
(Alone in my bed)

(No, no, no, no)
That's better than
Sleeping on the side crying at night (Baby, yeah)
Silently watching you sleep (Yeah)

(I'll sleep in the middle)
I'd rather sleep in the middle
I'd rather sleep in the middle
(I'd rather sleep in the middle, the middle, the middle)

I'd rather sleep in the middle
(I'd rather sleep in the middle, the middle, the middle)
I'd rather sleep in the middle
(Oh!)
I'd rather sleep in the middle
