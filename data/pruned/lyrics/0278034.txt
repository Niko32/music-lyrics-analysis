One two
One two three four

[Verse 1]
On the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is making music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again

[Verse 2]
On the road again
Goin' places that I've never been
Seein' things that I may never see again
And I can't wait to get on the road again

[Chorus]
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way

[Verse 3]
Is on the road again
I just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
You might also like[Chorus]
On the road again
Like a band of gypsies we go down the highway
We're the best of friends
Insisting that the world keep turning our way
And our way

[Verse 4]
Is on the road again
Just can't wait to get on the road again
The life I love is makin' music with my friends
And I can't wait to get on the road again
And I can't wait to get on the road again

[Outro]
Alright, thank you very much.Â
