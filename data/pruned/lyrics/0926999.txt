Now the hacienda's dark the town is sleeping
Now the time has come to part the time for weeping
Vaya con dios my darling may vaya con dios my love
Now the village mission bells are softly ringing
If you listen with your heart you'll hear them singing
Vaya con dios my darling may God be with you my love
Wherever you may be I'll be beside you although you're many million dreams away
Each night I'll say a prayer a prayer to guide you
To help you spend the lonely hour of every lonely day
Now the dawn is breaking through a gray tomorrow
But the memories we share are there to borrow
Vaya con dios my darling may God be with you my love
(Vaya con dios my darling) may God be with you my loveYou might also like
