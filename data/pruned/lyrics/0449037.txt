Come hard through the fog
Blindfolded and bound
Till we stand at the edge
Of a hole in the ground

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We hold hands and we jump
And as we fall, we sing
Paupers hammering the walls of the castle
Going to meet the king

[Chorus]
Never sleep, remember to breathe deep
Never sleep, remember to breathe
Breathe deep

[Verse 2]
Crash in from deep space
Shot birds falling fast
Who will be there to catch us in his jaw
When we arrive, alive, at last?

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can't hear you in the dark
Wish I knew where you'd gone
Know you're there, off in the shadows somewhere
Try to soldier on
You might also like[Chorus]
Never sleep, remember to breathe deep
Never sleep, remember to breathe
Breathe deep

[Bridge]
And breathe humbly
Secure your mouthpiece when you can
Toxic shapes adorn the walls
As we rise from our knees
Someone's coming to reward us, you wait and see
Or crush us both like fleas

[Chorus]
Never sleep, remember to breathe deep
Never sleep, remember to breathe
Breathe deep
