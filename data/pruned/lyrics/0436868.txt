It was déjà vu all over again...

[Hook: Titus Tucker]
When my eyes met yours
Got this feelin' that we've met before
I might be tripping and it might be more
Or maybe... This girl lives in my future, future, future
Yeah. She lives in my future, future, future
Something like a...
Deja vu
Deja vu
Deja vu


[Verse 1: Young Phlo]
I am thinkin back to day I... The first time I laid eyes
I just wanna thank God that he gave me great eyes
I did a double take I... Looked back on my way by (Looked back on my way by)
Like damn, is this deja vu?
Look at you. Mmm damn can you blame me?
I'm doing all this extra at the risk of looking crazy
But I'll risk that on my future and the chance we'll end up
Together. From a moment you don't remember
Just do me a favor, will you please?
Just think about this moment when you leave
For a second put your trust into me
Look into the future and then you'll see

[Verse 2: Young Phlo]
Somethin' about you got me trippin'
But i doubt you probably different
But i doubt you probably trippin'
Off me and my opinion
Like, what makes me a judge?
Shit, I can't even preside over what makes me in love
Hmm. Uh. Can you help me solve this?
Maybe it's those warm legs, maybe it's those soft lips
Maybe it's your fragrance. Makin' all them statements
But tell me how I know this... if we've never dated
I don't know. Either way, look I don't regret
Showed you my heart call it open chest
And if you're from the future hope you know its best
You leave me some kinda reminder so I don't forget
