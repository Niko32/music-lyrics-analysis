Like this gun they only shoot straight
Can’t stop trying to bend the ground I’ve covered now
And the clock ticks louder when I try to slow it down
None can judge the things I’ve done here
I done what I had to do and just a little bit more
Rows of faces who could never see me anyhow
I hitch to Juno ‘fore they figure it out
Can’t you hear
That last train come rolling
Come to carry
Old days away
Can’t you hear the hard times and hard times
Slipping away
Sideways rain won’t hurt you
Like memories it only sharpens time
He had the lost look of an angel in a broken town
And I could just as well have thought to never come around
Love didn’t have it in her
Dark and heavy like a twisted child
Spilt the waters of a rough and trashed out sea
Left me running down the frontage road off highway 3
Can’t you hear
That last train come rolling
Come to carry
Old days away
Can’t you hear the hard times and hard times
Slipping away
Can’t you hear
That last train come rolling
Come to carry
Old days away
Can’t you hear the hard times and hard times
Slipping away
People lie for a reason
Like the law they make up your mind
Police never found me when I needed ‘em anyhow
And I sure don’t need ‘em nowYou might also like
