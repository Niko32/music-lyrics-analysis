Some folks got nothing but trouble
So little joy in their lives
But wherever we go happiness follows
We must be loving right

[Verse 2]
Might be the way I adore you
Or the way that you hold me tight
I don't know the reason, girl, I'm believing
We must be loving right

[Chorus]
All our friends say love fades away with time
But I know they're wrong
'Cause they've never known
A love like yours and mine

[Verse 3]
So if the whole world goes crazy
Let everyone else fuss and fight
When all's said and done, we'll be the lucky ones
We must be loving right

[Verse 1]
Some folks got nothing but troubles
So little joy in their lives
But wherever we go happiness follows
We must be loving right
We must be loving rightYou might also like
