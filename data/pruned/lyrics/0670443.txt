I know I shouldn't be here tonight
I hardly know this man
It's been a long time since I've felt as pretty
As he tells me I am
I've met him at the coffee shop
And I've met him in the park
But I've never been alone with him
In this dress after dark

[Chorus]
There's so many shades of gray
This is black and white
He's some stranger's husband
And I'm some stranger's wife
Ten floors up he's waiting with champagne and candlelight
What'll keep me out of heaven will take me there tonight

[Verse 2]
The arrow's on the second floor
The bell's about to ring
And I have to turn away right now
Or walk into this thing
And if I step into that elevator
There ain't no turning around
And I don't know what scares me most
The ride up or the ride down
You might also like[Chorus]
There's so many shades of gray
This is black and white
He's some stranger's husband
And I'm some stranger's wife
Ten floors up he's waiting with champagne and candlelight
What'll keep me out of heaven will take me there tonight

[Outro]
Ten floors up he's waiting with champagne and candlelight
What'll keep me out of heaven will take me there tonight
