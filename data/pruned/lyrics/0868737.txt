City...)

This is a nuclear city
It doesn't have any crime
And all the girls there are pretty
Ooh, they never waste our time

I don't mind the radiation light
We're unaware of energy and air

'cos when you look into her eyes
And your head hits the pillow
It should come as no surprise (She comes as no surprise)
Her heart is absolute zero

I don't mind the radiation light
We're unaware of energy and air...

It's kind of fun when we're dancing on the sun
For make the business and make it number one

'cos that's all we need, girl
And that's all we need...
And that's all we need, girl
And that's all we need
You might also likeAnd all my friends get into it
All my friends need air
All my friends who're into it
But don't need it

And all my friends are into it
All my friends need air
All my friends who are into it (oh, oh, oh, the city)
But you don't, but you don't

All my friends are into it
All my friends need air
But all my friends are into it
But you don't need it

All my friends are into it
All my friends need air
All my friends who're into it
But you don't, no you don't... (the city, this is a nuclear... city)

No you don't, no you don't... (the city, this is a nuclear... city)
No you don't, no you don't... (the city, this is a nuclear... city)

No you don't, no you don't... (the city, this is a nuclear... city)
