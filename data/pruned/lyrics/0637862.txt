Dash light dripping on your sun tan skin
Radio playing that song again
Just pull me in, pull me in
Cut off shorts and a vinyl seat
Slide on over here next to me
Let me pull you in, let me pull you in girl
Ooh, if you didn't know by now I'm crazy about you
And I know the perfect place to stop

[Chorus: Dan + Shay]
The smell of honey suckle on a river bank
Fireflies, sweet tea, and the summer rain
Pouring all the way, all the way down
Cherry red lips calling out my name
Two-tone Ford and that parking brake
Pushed all the way, all the way down
All the way down

[Verse 2: Dan + Shay]
Middle of the middle in nowhere now
Go ahead girl, let your hair down
Just close your eyes, it's going to be a damn good night
Cut off the engine, toss the keys
Ain't nobody here, but you and me
And a little moon light
Out here in the country side
Ooh, I gotta feeling that you're crazy about me, too
Girl and don't you ever stop
You might also like[Chorus: Dan + Shay]
The smell of honey suckle on a river bank
Fireflies, sweet tea, and the summer rain
Pouring all the way, all the way down
Cherry red lips calling out my name
Two-tone Ford and that parking brake
Pushed all the way, all the way down

[Bridge: Dan + Shay]
Ooh, yeah
If you already know by now I'm crazy about you
Oh, tell me what you wanna do

[Chorus: Dan + Shay]
The smell of honey suckle on a river bank
Fireflies, sweet tea, and the summer rain
Pouring all the way, all the way down
Cherry red lips calling out my name
Two-tone Ford and that parking brake
Pushed all the way, all the way down

[Outro: Dan + Shay]
Those cherry lips call my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah
All the way, all the way, all the way down, yeah
Ooh yeah, baby
All the way down
