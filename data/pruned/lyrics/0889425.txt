Yeah, yeah, you

Traveling, ooh, traveling, traveling
Traveling, ooh, traveling, traveling
Over God's country

We have been blessed with one more tomorrow
To make our dreams come true
So let's take this time before life passes by
To make real our fantasies

There's a place I love and often dreamed of
Like a painted picture, it's so beautiful
Late at night when all the stars are shining
It's so lovely to see, would you like to go with me

Traveling over God's country
You and me
Traveling me and you, together
Traveling over God's country
(Whoa-whoa...)

You always wanted to fly like the wind
To a place where we first began
So, to the east in the morning light
We'll ride into paradise

You and me
Traveling, you and me
(Traveling, ooh, traveling)
Traveling over God's country
You and me
(Traveling over God's country)

Love is our guide as we take to the sky
To the land of majesty
There's love everywhere because people do care
What a lovely sight to see

God's country
To the land of milk and honey
(What can you do)
God's country
There you're sure to find
(How good to know for more time)

Traveling, ooh, traveling, traveling
Traveling, ooh, traveling, traveling
Over God's country

To the east in the morning light
We'll ride into paradise, paradise
Traveling over God's country
You and me
Traveling, you and me
Traveling over God's country
You and me
Over God's country

Traveling over God's country
You and me
Traveling, you and me
Traveling over God's country
You and me
Over God's country...
