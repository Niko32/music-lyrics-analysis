Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine
Heir of salvation, purchase of God
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood

[Chorus]
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long

[Verse 2]
Perfect submission, perfect delight
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight
And angels, descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love

[Chorus]
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior all the day long
This is my story, this is my song
Praising my Savior

Praising the Father in Heaven
Whose Son died for me
Praising my Savior all the day long, ohYou might also like
