That's where I'll be found
Down on the corner of love

Neath the stars that shine
And neon signs
Down on the corner of love

When night starts to fall
And love starts to call
Down on the corner of love

You'll find me hangin around
That's where I'll be found
Down on the corner of love

When it's late in the evenin'
I can't help a feelin'
My heart you're stealin'
Neath the stars up above

Oh, when the sun goes down
And the moon comes around
I'll be down on the corner of love

Oh, when the sun goes down
And the moon comes around
I'll be down on the corner of love
You might also likeIf you're passin' by
Too lonesome to cry
Down on the corner of love

Just stop for a while
I'll teach you to smile
Down on the corner of love

The love that you had
Dirtied you bad
Down on the corner of love

Forget you were blue
And start life anew
Down on the corner of love

When it's late in the evenin'
I can't help a feelin'
My heart you're stealin'
Neath the stars up above

Oh, when the sun goes down
And the moon comes around
I'll be down on the corner of love
