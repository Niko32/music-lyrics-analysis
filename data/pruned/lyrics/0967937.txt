Indifferent
To our walk and that is for real
Less pray on ungodly chase
Be patient, love
In hope we endure

This time it's
Indifferent
To our walk and that is for real
A car crash
A cancer's fast
Be mindful, love, humble and near
This time it's unprejudiced
Careless, love
Loose and unclear

It's the right place
The only place
Be patient, love
Nothing's for sure
It's the right place
The only place
Be patient, love
Nothing's for sureYou might also like
