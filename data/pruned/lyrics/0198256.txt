I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The son of God discloses

[Chorus]
And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known

[Verse 2]
He speaks and the sound of His voice
Is so sweet that the birds hush their singing
And the melody that He gave to me
Within my heart is ringing

[Chorus]
And He walks with me
And He talks with me
And He tells me I am His own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
You might also like[Outro]
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
