You say you had to go
And why, you didn't know
And I tried to understand

[Chorus]
When you called me from Santa Fe
You said you needed one more day
And you'd be back to hold my hand
Ah, but you let me down again

[Verse 2]
And winter turned to spring
And you called from Tennessee
And you got the best of me

[Chorus]
You promised me you wouldn't stay
In Memphis more than one more day
And you'd be back to hold my hand
Ah, but you let me down again

[Verse 3]
And you called from the coast
Saying you were lost
And it was me you missed the most
You might also like[Outro]
You promised me you wouldn't stay
In Mobile more than one more day
And you'd be back to hold my hand
And you called me from Bellmore
And said you needed one more day
And you'd be back home again
You promised me you wouldn't stay
In Denver more than one more day
And you'd be back to hold my hand
And you called me from Santa Fe
And said you needed on more day
And you'd be back home again
Ah, you let me down again
