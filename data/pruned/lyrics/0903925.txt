We represent the trial;
The dead existence - fallen
Don't look in our eyes
They won't be seen again
This is a former state - we're non-existent
No one else should know
It's not for them to say
Because we are called -
The chosen few
Now you can't escape
But you realize you never really wanted to
And strength fills your insides

This cross is suicide
We are suicide
This cross is suicide
We are suicide

All should come and die;
Not for the symbol, but for the One who is symbolized
Our light is inside
All else is darkness
Till the morning time, because the sun will rise
This is suicide
This bloody cross, where does it lead me?
To my own demise
Where's your secret life?
You're gonna hide your face to be recognized
You better recognize
You might also likeThis cross is suicide
We are suicide
This cross is suicide
We are suicide

And they'll cry out "Let the mountains hide us, and the hills fall on us."
I'll stand tall with the strength inside from the Spirit of Truth

Let the earth swallow me whole
Let the earth swallow me whole
Hide me from the justice of the Lamb
