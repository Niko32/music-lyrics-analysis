If I don't think about the fact that she left me
If I don't see the pearls fall from the sky
If I don't hear the accusations of blasphemy
If I don't feel the tears in my eyes
This is the best day of my life

[Verse 1: Prince]
You say you'll call me and then and then you don't
I'll want to kiss you and then I won't
We both do nothing and call it love
Is this love?
Is this love?

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Prince]
This morning I wanted a cup of coffee but I didn't have any cream
Last night I wanted some inspiration but I didn't have any dreams
Coupled with the fact that you belong to another whose name is self-righteousness
So evil girl, if one of us has a date
With the undertaker, which one will it be?
You can cry forever, but you'll get no sympathy
This is the best day of my life

[Chorus: Prince]
I've got three chains o' gold
And they will shine forever
They are the nucleus of my soul
Melt down, no, they will never
I've got three chains o' gold
And they will shine forever
They are the nucleus of my soul
Melt down, no, they will never
You might also like[Spoken Interlude: Mayte]
Give back the chains
If you don't you will die
Nothing should come between you and I

[Chorus: Prince]
I've got three chains o' gold
And they will shine forever
If one of us has to go
You will go before me
If one of us has to go
(Three chains o' gold)
You will go before me
(Three chains o' gold)
You will go before me, baby
(They will shine forever)
'Cause I sure enough say you will

[Outro: Prince]
(Three chains o' gold)
(You will go before me)
(You will go before me)
(You will go before me)
(You will go before me)
I've got three chains o' gold
They gonna shine
Forever, forever, forever
(Three chains o' gold)
