I give blood to prove to myself
That I can matter to somebody else
Is what makes a man the dirt on his hands?
Don't put your faith in the desert sand
The wind is always blowing
There are gallows deep inside my lungs
That's where I hung ambition

[Chorus]
Is it luck that's knocking right on my back door?
Because I've been breaking mirrors since 1984
I walk under ladders, I spill salt on sores
And I open my umbrella even when I am indoors
So give me seven more

[Verse 2]
I give blood not for the cause
But to slowly give up the person I was
Holding my breath won't help
Everything went to hell
So now I steal back pennies from the well
Because my wishes failed
I am screaming at my own shadow
To stop living like a ghost
You might also like[Chorus]
Is it luck that's knocking right on my back door?
Because I've been breaking mirrors since 1984
I walk under ladders, I spill salt on sores
And I open my umbrella even when I am indoors
So give me seven more

[Bridge]
I don't need her; I'm not that desperate
Come visit me in twenty years and maybe then
'Cause I'm not done screaming yet
You can call off the intervention
'Cause I don't need your attention

[Chorus]
Is it luck that's knocking right on my back door?
Because I've been breaking mirrors since 1984
I walk under ladders, I spill salt on sores
And I open my umbrella even when I am indoors
So give me seven more

[Outro]
I don't need her; I'm not that desperate
I don't need her; I'm not that desperate
