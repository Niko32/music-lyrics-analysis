She had a body, that every type of man would kill for
Committing homicide or pointing at your own temple
I tried to be extravagant, but she's too simple
Tried to give her all i had, but it wasn't enough tho
Like incomplete info, she couldn't get the memo,
Now, she killing me slow like the speed of this tempo
Couldn't get her out my mind, i would try, no lie
I thought about her all the time and it kills me inside
But, it sucks to say that she ain't mines no more
Used to be holding hands, where ever we go
Kissing in every aisle in the grocery store
So precious, she was like a diamond pearl
I tried to be the best man like i was in a wedding
May be things would be better if we were embedding
Ways to make it work, ways to stop the hurt
May be if we did our tears wouldn't be in the dirt

[Hook x2]:
I use to give you her I had but it wasn't enough
Use to do her anything but it wasn't enough
I use to give her flowers on the special day of the month
But even with all of this I guess it wasn't enough

Dewey [Verse 2]:
See I thought I meant alot, but I wasn't enough
I gotta grow thick skin, girl I thought I was tough
But I'm, slowly struggling with the pain that I feel
It's like you threw it all away, with your make up concealed
All the blue prints, to a situation of us
It's like you put me in the ground, like a grain of dust
And now, your with a man who doesn't even show love
I hope you understand there's nothing like the old love
My own love, I guess it didn't feel right
And I'm, slowly moving on with my feelings despite
We had some special, that was me and you
And I'm embarrassed of these feelings if it wasn't true
Damn, you took my heart and you gave it away
I'm wishing that you came back at the end of the day
But your gone, I'm packed up and I'm ready to go
I guess it's time to move on but I want you to know

Mike [Verse 3]:
See, the truth is i want you, i never wanna leave you
I'm so confused, did you find another dude?
You were the sock to my shoe, the bowl to hold my soup
Tensions so high like you red and I'm blue
I don't understand, you got me feeling unwanted
Always fighting like we're thrown in the gauntlet
But, to be honest, it's not what I've done
Cus i treated you the best, better than anyone
I've done my part from the start, we're destined to be apart
You broke my heart, always pushing me away like a cart
But, soon you'll understand that you played the wrong card
And you'll finally see it all once I'm gone,
You'll never understand, your mistake with this guy
Gone in a second like a shooting star in the sky
Cus real eyes realize real lies
And I'm a real guy that you just lost, bye bye, deuces
