Underneath the stars I'll meet you
Underneath the stars I'll greet you
And there beneath the stars I'll leave you
Before you go of your own free will

[Chorus]
Go gently

[Verse 2]
Underneath the stars you met me
Underneath the stars you left me
I wonder if the stars regret me
At least you'll go of your own free will

[Chorus]
Go gently

[Verse 3]
Here beneath the stars I'm landing
I'm here beneath the stars not ending
Why on earth am I pretending?
I'm here again, the stars befriending
They come and go of their own free will

[Chorus]
Go gently
Go gently
You might also like[Verse 4]
Underneath the stars you met me
And underneath the stars you left me
I wonder if the stars regret me
I'm sure they'd like me if they only met me
They come and go of their own free will

[Chorus]
Go gently
Go gently
Go gently
