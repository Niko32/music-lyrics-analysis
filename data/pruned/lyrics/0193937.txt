Lookin' back at the dead ends and the detours
All I can do is long for the straighter line
Yeah, I was lost, I had no way of knowin'
Where the twists and turns were goin'
But sometimes, just gotta let the road wind

[Chorus]
Could it've been easier? Yeah
A little smoother ride? Maybe so
But lyin' here with you would I change one thing 'bout that road?
No

[Verse 2]
I believe things happen for a reason
Even though you might not see it at the time
'Cause now I know
Every plan that came unraveled
Every crooked path I traveled in my life
Led me here to your side

[Chorus]
Could have been easier? Yeah
A little smoother ride? Maybe so
But lyin' here with you would I change one thing 'bout that road?
No
You might also like[Bridge]
Yeah, I finally found you

[Outro]
Could it have been easier? Yeah
A little smoother ride? Maybe so
But lyin' here with you would I change one thing 'bout that road?
It could've been easier, yeah
A little smoother ride, maybe so
But lyin' here with you would I change one thing 'bout that road?
No
