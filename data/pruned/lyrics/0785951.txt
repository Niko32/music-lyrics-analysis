Hope unknown
Sometimes just waking is surreal
I pass right through the nameless ones
I know that hope's unknown
Sometimes the water feels so real
As I walk through it fills my lungs, my god I'm drowning

[Pre-Chorus: Jade Puget, with Davey Havok]
This day never seems to end
This pain, never
This day never seems to end
This rage I cannot let (go)

[Chorus 1: Davey Havok, Jade Puget]
I hear them calling my name (Oh)
I feel them gnawing out holes
All throughout my flawless soul
I hear them calling my name (Oh)
I feel them gnawing out holes (Whoa)
All throughout my flawless soul

[Verse 2: Davey Havok]
So alone
Sometimes I swear that I can hear
The taunting of the voiceless ones
I fear that I alone
Fear those who finally ceased to feel
That they're alone inside this place, I am the misplaced

This day never seems to end
This pain, never
This day never seems to end
This rage I cannot let (go)

[Chorus 1: Davey Havok, Jade Puget]
I hear them calling my name (Oh)
I feel them gnawing out holes
All throughout my flawless soul
I hear them calling my name (Oh)
I feel them gnawing out holes (Whoa)
All throughout my flawless soul

[Bridge: Davey Havok]
Now every face looks familiar
Found every face would melt away until now
Everyone
Do you know?
I know your deception
Now every face looks familiar
Found every face would melt away until now
Everyone
Do you know? (Do you know?)
I know your deception
[Chorus 2: Davey Havok, Jade Puget]
I hear them (Oh)
I hear them calling my name
I feel them gnawing out holes
All throughout my flawless soul
I hear them (Oh)
I hear them calling my name (Oh)
I feel them gnawing out holes
All throughout my flawless soul
