It never gave warning
I never knew something to be so real
I’m taken by the jet stream
I’m leaving like a daydream
Or could it be a change in the century
I know, I got to leave it behind
I know, I’ve made up my mind

I want to feel, I want to really know
I got to be the one now to tell you that you’ll forever shine
I want to feel (want to feel)
I want to see the sun (see the sun)
I want to be the one now to tell you that you’ll forever shine

I’m ticking like a time bomb
Tripping over my soul on
I’m heading for the coast and most of all there’s no turning back
Needing something to believe in
And stop the shit that I’ve been reading
Lay it down, turn into it all, let it be revealed
I know, I got to leave it behind
I know, I’ve made up my mind, ya

I want to feel, I want to really know
I got to be the one now to tell you that you’ll forever shine
I want to feel (want to feel)
I want to see the sun (see the sun)
I want to be the one now to tell you that you’ll forever shine
Shine
Shine
You might also likeI never saw it coming
It never gave warning
I never knew something to be so real (so real)

I want to feel, I want to really know
I got to be the one now to tell you that you’ll forever shine
I want to feel (want to feel)
I want to see the sun (see the sun)
I want to be the one now to tell you that you’ll forever shine
Shine, let it shine ya
Shine, let it shine, shine
