Verse 1: It's the return of the terrorist, Misfit Nation just a gang of degenerates/
I am never scared and my additude is never quit, wordbank arsenal I'm well equipt/
Look, just tell 'em this, these other niggas irrelevent/
Just kill yourself, and please don't kill the messanger/
They ask me why I rap, I like the benefits/
And I don't give a fuck, my additude is selebet/

Lighter Leash intact while I'm smoking on this medical/
Fuck it, I'ma leave it to my family/

Verse 2: There's blood in the oil, blood on my hands matching the blood in the soil/
Spring up with a coil, chill after and roll up the bud in the foil/
Motherfuck me right? do my Hammer Dance, you can't touch me right?/
Or me left, smoking on a peace pipe, like them with their faces covered up and their jeans tight/
What you doing to my peirs, and now you're looking at me like what you doing to my ears/
Looking at the cities I ruined and I do it just for cheers/
Tried to smoke me out my cave but I been doing it for years/
Bic click nigga, put it in her mouth and watch my dick get bigger/
I'm a hungry man this ain't no picnic nigga/
Please no pictures, I'm a sick sick nigga/

Verse 3: Usama Bin Laden of the rap game, I keep the dice rolling like a crap game/
I see blurry so I keep my vision black frames, and I call your bitch just to polish up my mack game/
They be like you back man, I'm like I never left/
I'm just doing shit, that you would have never guessed/
Never the less, I'm never the less, I'll remember the worst, if I'm ever the best/
And I'm never the worst, burning pain and torture/
Ya'll a bunch or squares so I guess I'm cutting corners/
Barely fitting in the booth, my head is so enormous/
And I keep a bunch of bitches around, like the mormans/
Don't know if I'll love you in the morning, and I'm yawning/
Meaning you boring, the boss, foreman/
And I'm headed to the top, on the back of a camel all praise to Allah, my God/
