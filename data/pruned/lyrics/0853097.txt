All you need to do is call
He will hear your faintest cry
He's concerned about you

So, while your tears are flowing through
Your time of mourning
He is here to lift your heavy heart
'Cause He's in love with you

He knows, He cares
He sees, He's there
And He'll carry you
He's concerned about you

Weeping may endure for a night
But the morning will bring joy
He won't give you more than you can bear
He's concerned about you

He loves you, oh, yes
He loves you, ooh...
He loves you, I know He does
He really does
He's concerned about you
You might also likeHe knows, He cares
He sees, He's there
He'll carry you
He's concerned about you

Well, He knows and He cares
He sees, He's right there
He'll carry you
He's concerned about you
He's concerned about you
He's concerned about you
