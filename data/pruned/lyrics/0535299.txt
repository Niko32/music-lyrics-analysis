Don't let go and slip down into the deep
I'll hold you up but it's harder and harder to see
Down here, where the light fades
The sound of our loving is swallowed inside, there's nowhere to hide

[Chorus]
Always live for love, you said
Never live for pain, you said
So why are we trapped in this slipstream of me?
We both can't tread water

[Verse 2]
There's more to this than can ever be the truth
Steel blue on my lips and the taste, the taste of you
Like ribbons round my neck, the tide tightens, the dark lightens
But I won't leave, I won't let go, you're all I've ever known

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
You're drowning in me
And you're pulling me, pulling me down
The water is rising
Rising up in me
And I can't look away
And I can't breathe
It's all disappearing, it's all slowly sinking
And I just need to leaveYou might also like
