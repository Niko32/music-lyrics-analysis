This is a hardcore beat
You even can dance if you like
You won't get in trouble
And if you had some space
You won't know who hit ya
You won't even give a fuck
Watching them take you away
Is it wrong or right
Yeah!

[Verse 2]
Whats with the wait you waiter
You only ate your garnish
I ordered spam and rice
Is this to say your fired
We danced on the tabletops
We only have a dollar
We ordered too many cocktails
Watching the weight of the worldYou might also like
