Well, since my baby left me, I've found a new place to dwell
It's down at the end of Lonely Street at Heartbreak Hotel
And I'm so lonely, baby, I'm so lonely
I'm so lonely I could die

[Verse 2]
And though it's always crowded, you still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers to cry there in the gloom
And they'll be lonely, baby, yes they'll be lonely
They'll be so lonely they could die

[Verse 3]
The bellhop's tears keep flowing, the desk clerk's dressed in black
They've been so long on Lonely Street, they never will go back
And they'll be lonely, yes they'll be so lonely, baby
They'll be so lonely they could die

[Verse 4]
So if your baby leaves you, you'll have a tale to tell
Just take a walk down Lonely Street to Heartbreak Hotel
Where you'll be lonely, yes you'll be so lonely
We'll be so lonely that we could die

[Verse 5]
And though it's always crowded, you still can find some room
For broken-hearted lovers to cry there in the gloom
And they'll be lonely, yes they'll be lonely
They'll be so lonely they could dieYou might also like
