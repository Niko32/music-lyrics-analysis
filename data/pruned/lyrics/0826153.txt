No one ever made me feel
That I could ever make it
Lord, no one ever gave me anything
All they did was take it
No one, no one ever held my hand
When I needed them to
Oh no, nobody but you

[Chorus: Gladys Knight & The Pips]
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody, nobody but you

[Verse 2: Gladys Knight & The Pips]
No one ever looked inside
The walls I build around me
And I tell you, every time that I felt lost
No one, ooh, no one ever found me
No one, no one ever cried for me
When my dreams fell through
Oh no (Nobody), no, nobody but you

[Chorus: Gladys Knight & The Pips]
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody, nobody but you
You might also like[Bridge: Gladys Knight & The Pips]
No one ever said (Lean on me)
No one ever told me (You've got a friend)
No, nobody said
I'll be your bridge over troubled waters
I'm gonna be there (I'm gonna be there)
Oh (Be there 'til the end)
No, no

[Outro: Gladys Knight & The Pips]
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody, nobody, nobody but you
