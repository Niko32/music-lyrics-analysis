If Life Gives You Wings
You Might Actual Fly
If You Made Mistakes
Then I Don’t Know Why
It’s Time To Wake Up
And Make My Own Decisions
It’s Time To Go Up
And Live My Illusions

[Pre-Chorus - Both]
It’s The Way You Move
It’s The Way You Act
And The Way You Approve
But I’m Sorry I Overreact

[Chorus - Both]
It’s Making Me Blush
Under The Pillow
But I Wasn’t In Love I Had A Crush
Fighting With My Elbow
It’s Unforgettable, Unforgettable, Un-un-unforget-get-get-able

[Verse 2 - Ronay]
I Just Can’t Believe That This Is My Life
You Have To Relieve That I’m Breaking In Five
Life Without You Means Nothing Girl
I Just Wanna Be Only With You Boy

It’s The Way You Move
It’s The Way You Act
And The Way You Approve
But I’m Sorry I Overreact

[Chorus - Both]
It’s Making Me Blush
Under The Pillow
But I Wasn’t In Love I Had A Crush
Fighting With My Elbow
It’s Unforgettable, Unforgettable, Un-un-unforget-get-get-able

[Verse 3 - Both]
Hunny
Bunny
You’re Kinda Funny
But It’s Sunny
So Let’s Rock That Shit And Make Some Money. (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus - Both]
It’s The Way You Move
It’s The Way You Act
And The Way You Approve
But I’m Sorry I Overreact
[Chorus - Both]
It’s Making Me Blush
Under The Pillow
But I Wasn’t In Love I Had A Crush
Fighting With My Elbow
It’s Unforgettable, Unforgettable, Un-un-unforget-get-get-able
