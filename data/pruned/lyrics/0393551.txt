Could you always?
Maybe sometimes?
Take it easy
Take your time

[Verse 1: Cinco]

It was back in 91 when I got my start
I fit the part and by 5, I was good with art
I think I started a collection
For the affection
And soon, was the center of attention
Did I meantion detentions all the time?
Because instead of learning lessons, I just chose to rhyme
They weren't the dopest lines
I just spoke on what I knew about
Crushing on different girls, bball, and sneaking out
Writing rhymes with my guys, then we'd hit the trampolina
We played up in the street, we didn't care where grass was greener
Those were my younger days, but I'm still rhyming just for fun today
But with a stronger motivation
To live a lot better, put my parents on vacation
Permanently, I'm yearnin' to be
And I have felt this way since I way since I was learning to read

[Verse 2: Cinco]

See, you could catch me up in study hall
Ninth grade, man, I was bumping Cudi all
Night and day, I mean Day N Night
Turn me on some Bobby Ray and then my day was alright
Man, the feeling was the greatest
To know that I could rap and still remain creative
I knew that I could make it
And still do
So I'm stacking up my bars until I got a good view
Who knew?
I'm bout to do it like I've never done it
Started with nothin', now deaf people hear me comin'
I'm gonna run it
Ain't a doubt up in my brain
I got the game, I feel it running through my veins
Even with diapers on my ass
I knew it was my path to be passing up my class
They'll crash, then finish last
I'll laugh and hit the gas
And I'm never gonna finish, I'll just go another lap

[Chorus: Grizzly Bear - "Two Weeks" Sample]
[Outro: Cinco]

With everything thats happened
All the events in my life, I feel like...
I feel like there's nothing else to do
...But music
So I sit back...
