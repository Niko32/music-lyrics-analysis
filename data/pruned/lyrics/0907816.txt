I'll say
Yes please
To you today
So don't ask me
Cuz I'm weak that way
Just don't ask me
O. K

I'm so glad we got that
Straightened away

If you see me
Walk by
You better just let me
Walk by
You better not
Bat your pretty eyes
You better not
Stop me to say hi

I got a sweet tooth today
So you better not cut that pie

If you ask me
I'll say
Yes please
To you today
So don't ask me
Cuz I'm weak that way
Just don't ask me
