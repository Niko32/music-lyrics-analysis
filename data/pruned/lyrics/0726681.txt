Will you do as I, do as I please?
If I could do this again, would I even go?
Would I even, would I go?

I have this ocean of dreams in front of me
I'll swim to the sun and cast no shadows
I have this ocean of dreams in front of me; swim to the sun

Can I sail far across the seas?
Will you do as I, do as I please?
If I could do this again, would I even go?
Would I even, would I go?

I have this ocean of dreams in front of me
I'll swim to the sun and cast no shadows
I have this ocean of dreams in front of me; swim to the sun

It's a waste to fall

And I won't let go
Of this now, we cast no shadows in the dark
And as we embark, on a journey in our dreams
We'll find our true ending

Let's go, let's go, let's go
We're swimming to the sun
We won't let go
We're swimming to the sun
Cast away
We're swimming to the sunYou might also like
