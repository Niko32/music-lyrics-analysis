I don't know where it all began
I only know what I was told
Now rumours fly in from everywhere
People got so cold

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't mind
I'll stand anywhere with you anytime
Oh, when the night is falling
Conversation just wastes your time

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll fall in line
I'll fall in line

[Verse 2]
People make up the wildest things
I know that sometimes they're true
But you don't have to hide a thing from me
I've had my troubles too

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got time
To keep walking beside you forever
Girl, I don't mind
When the streets are empty
Oh, and you're feeling lost and left behind
You might also like[Chorus]
I'll fall in line
I'll fall in line

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I've seen the shadows coming over you
When some fool drags you down
You know they're watching everything you do

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let it turn you around
Walk on by
Don't let the world of suggestion catch your eye
Oh, when the night is falling girl and you need
Someone to hide behind

[Chorus]
Oh, I'll fall in line
I'll fall in line
I'll fall in line
