No lite, no sound
No lite, no sound
No lite, no sound
No lite, no sound

[Verse 1]
Fall out
You’ll never know
Where the show stops
And reality clocks on
To how much you’ll never know

Fall out
I will annul
The answer that I will never show
To how much you’ll never know

[Chorus]
Baby if you were ever inside
(Then I would not go)
Tell me that everything is outside
(‘Cos I’m in the same show)
Maybe we could do it better next time
This is the city where the past died

No lite, no sound

[Verse 2]
Call out- “I will invoke
The actors, the kids in the back row
For how long, you’ll never know”

Call out- “I will invoke
The warm sun, the stars of the last show
For how long, you’ll never know”

[Chorus]
Baby if you were ever inside
(Then I would not go)
Tell me that everything is outside
(‘Cos I’m in the same show)
Now that everybody’s on the same side
This is the city where the sun died

[Outro]
No lite, no sound
No lite, no sound
No lite, no sound
No lite, no sound
No lite, no sound
No lite, no sound
No lite, no sound
No lite, no sound
