Always sisters, always friends
Let's stay real close till the end
Forgiving each other, letting love cover
Always sisters, always friends

We have to live in harmony
(Oh, yeah)
Even though we may disagree
'Cause fighting each other, is not the answer
But sharing the greatest gift, ooh...
Let's be enriched with peace and love
Having compassion from above
Never forsaking, just understanding
Ain't that what families are made of

Always sisters, always friends

No matter what may come or go
(No matter)
We stick together and it shows
This bond between us
Foundation is trust, yes, it is
That's what true family is all about
(Family is all about, yeah)
