Take a look at unselected cases
You'll find love has been wrecked
By both sides compromising
Amounting to a disastrous effect

[Verse 1]
You hear stories of old, of princes bold
With riches untold, happy souls
Casting all aside to take some bride
To have the girl of their dreams at their side

[Pre-Chorus]
But not me, I couldn't do that
Not me, I'm not like that

[Chorus]
I couldn't sacrifice anything at all
To love

[Verse 2]
I really like you, I'm attracted to you
The way you move, the things you do
I'll probably burn in hell for saying this
But I'm really in heaven whenever we kiss
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But oh no, you won't change me
You can try for an eternity

[Chorus]
I wouldn't sacrifice anything at all
To love

[Refrain]
Take a look at unselected cases
You'll find love has been wrecked
By both sides compromising
Amounting to a disastrous effect

[Verse 3]
Now I've got things to do, you have too
And I've got to be me, you've got to be you
So take my hand and feel these lips
And let's savour a kiss like we'd savour a sip

[Pre-Chorus]
Of vintage wine one more time
Let's surrender to this love divine

[Chorus]
But we won't sacrifice anything at all
To love
