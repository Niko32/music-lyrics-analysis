Seems like I can't live with you
But I can't live without you
I know that time will never change you
So there's just no sense in living anymore

[Verse 1:]
Remember at the start, we had the world by the tail
Seems like nothing we two could try just ever could fail
Then the lovin' slipped away and you stood by and you just let it
Someday I know that you'll regret it
When they send that pain on back to you
The lovin' fires burned cold, with only ashes left behind
Guess your kisses made me blind
Cause then the magic disappeared and
You stood by and you just let it
Someday I know that you'll regret it
When someone else goes and steps all over you
