Just like the sun over the mountaintop
You know I'll always come again
You know I love to spend my mornings
Like sunlight dancing on your skin
I've never gone so wrong
As for telling lies to you
What you see is what I am
There is nothing I could hide from you
You see me better than I can

[Chorus]
Out on the road that lies before me now
There is some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
'Til I can gain control again

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
And like a lighthouse, you must stand alone
Landmark a safe journey's end
No matter what sea I've been sailing on
I'll always come back home again

[Chorus]
Out on the road that was before me now
There are some turns where I will spin
I only hope that you can hold me now
'Til I can gain control again
I only hope that you can hold me now
'Til I can gain control againYou might also like
