You're my world, the shelter from the rain
You're the pills, that take away my pain
You're the light, that helps me find my way
You're the words, when I have nothing to say

[Chorus]
In this world where nothing else is true
Here I am still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you
Still tangled up in you

[Verse 2]
You're the fire, that warms me when I'm cold
You're the hand I have to hold as I grow old
You're the shore, when I am lost at the sea
You're the only thing that I like about me

[Chorus]
And in this world where nothing else is true
Here I am still tangled up in you
I'm still tangled up in you

[Bridge]
How long has it been, since this storyline began
And I hope it never ends, and goes like this forever
You might also like[Outro]
In this world where nothing else is true
Here I am, still tangled up in you
Tangled up in you
(I'm still tangled up in you)
I'm still tangled up in you
(I'm still tangled up in you)
