I hate to say it out loud
But I was just dumped
I thought we had something special
Just last night
I even said the word love

He started the evening
With I got a few things to say
We just aren't good together
So take care and have a real good day
Ummm, okay
If that's the way you wanna do it
If that's the way you wanna walk away well

I'm not coming undone
I've got nothing but love
You put the F U in fun
But it's all good
I'm not trying to fight
I'm not wasting my time
I'm just saying goodbye
One finger shy of the peace sign

You think that you can delete me
With a few sorry words on our page
To you it was so complicated
Such an invasion of your precious space
If that's the way you wanna do it
If that's the way you wanna walk away well
You might also likeI'm not coming undone
I've got nothing but love
You put the F U in fun
But it's all good
I'm not trying to fight
I'm not wasting my time
I'm just saying goodbye
One finger shy of the peace sign

You thought you knew me well
Thought I was too lady like to say
Go to

I'm not coming undone
I've got nothing but love
You put the F U in fun
But it's all good
I'm not trying to fight
I'm not wasting my time
I'm just saying goodbye
One finger shy of the peace sign

One finger shy of the peace sign
