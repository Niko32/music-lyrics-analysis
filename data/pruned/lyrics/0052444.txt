[Samantha Steinhart]:

I don't know which road to turn down
I don't know which path to take
Cause every time I try to turn around
There's just another path to face
So tell me how I'm gonna get through this
When everything is falling apart
I tried too many times to find the light
But I'm only getting cought in the dark

Verse 1 [DicE]:
I stall and stop, get out and run
No destination or where I'm from
My heart is cold, my mind is lost
Thoughts of my past and all the loss
My father gone, my brother caged
My mother struggles, I'm full of hate
I was engaged, she broke my heart
I'm left alone, left in the dark
You couldn't handle what I've went through
"Dice is crazy, said he hates me, hurt my feelings"
And I meant to, I won't mend you
Won't be nice to you and no I won't pretend to
If I'm lost it's probably cause of you
These haters wanna end you, now I..

Verse 2 [DicE]:
They won't lend you no helping hands
So don't go hoping you'll see them
They ain't trynna see you shine
They wouldn't care if you ain't breathin'
They'll just take from you, everything
Than you'll find them leavin'
You won't see them cause they left you
Now your hurt cause you believed them
But their selfish, leave you helpless
Till' you no longer can stand it
These are haters, that's our planet
Either man up or get stranded
And they will take you for granted
They will use you, take advantage of you
Run you for everything, all the sacrafice you hand it
Can not help you, why can't it? cause these are people today
And if you travel like it's nothing, they will get in the way
And they will say what you don't want them to, they're nothing but liars
That keep on throwing nails and rocks to try to flatten your tires
That's why I...

Verse 3 [DicE]:
I put my heart in this, how many times must I get by
The struggles, all the rubble, all the pain I took into my mind
The fire showing through my eyes, the blood I've cried
The lies, the cries, the whats, the whys
The rain, the byes, the pain that makes me wanna die
It's why...
