Killed the competition, body's in the kitchen
This is my job, work Monday to Friday
Can't stop thinking, mind running like a 5k
My enemy approached me, said he was better
I robbed him naked, now I'm rockin' his sweater
I robbed him blind, even took his eye sockets
Took his cash and stashed it in my pocket
I use these two fists to make fools toothless
For my amusement I produce bruises
Cool it, one more word and it's fatal
I'll serve ya like a ladle, knuckle to naval
Nose bleedin', bringing violence to your sinuses
Stop crying, bitch, we know you are spineless
.38 special, produced from my pocket
Finger on the trigger, thumb ready to cock it
My one wish to have blood run on your chin
We're playing a game called wheel of fortune
Unloaded the whole clip, spun it and rolled it
This game is Russian, it is called Roulette
Only after hours do I whack the cowards
After an hour he unravels in my shower
Hydrochloric acid makes the body bubbly
What's troubling is that this does not trouble me
Scalpel the scalp to skin, organs for harvest
Hair, nails, and bone get thrown in the garbage
The meat is red, and the veins are pink
I drain my mind and finally drain the sink
My lightbulb is quite dull, help me, my mind's ill
I unwind with some wine combined with Nyquil
Six shots sound, and six cops down
Bury them with lead, they don't get no ground
Chin up and chest out like I was proud of it
Crown on my head, whole towns bow to it
Gotta stay low I know they will arrest me
The only catch to that is that they've gotta catch me
My Glock's shots rock ya block, causing shock
Fully cocked and hot, I am not gonna stop
Storytime's over, I told this, I told that
Interrupt like hiccups, I'm out like old fadsYou might also like
