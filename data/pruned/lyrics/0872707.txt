I never was all that good
At being with one woman
But I never was all that bad
At being a good man
I used to think my time
Was precious
And best spent runnin
I've had to put a million miles behind me
To help me understand

[Chorus]
What I really want
What I've waited on
Is something Real
There's a missing a part
That my empty heart can't fill
Oh I know she's out there somewhere now
I know she's meant for me somehow
The one and only one
That makes me feel
Something real

[Verse 2]
I always thought I'd know her when I saw her
I guess I'm just a dreamer
Been waitin for the girl
I can't just be with
I want the want I can't be without
No I won't live without
You might also like[Chorus]
What I really want
What I've waited on
Is something Real
There's a missing a part
That my empty heart can't fill
Oh I know she's out there somewhere now
I know she's meant for me somehow
The one and only one
That makes me feel
Something real

[Outro]
Oh I know you're out there somewhere now
I know you're meant for me somehow
The One Who Makes Me Feel
Something Real
