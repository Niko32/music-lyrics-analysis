I buried all the dreams I had of you so I'll be alright in the morning
I'll be alright in the morning I never thought that I'd get over you
I'll be alright in the morning cause tonight I finally found the love that's true

Another love another start another dream another heart
Another life for me begins with dawn tomorrow memories of you will be gone
I'll be alright in the morning...

Another love another start...
Oh tonight I finally found the love that's trueYou might also like
