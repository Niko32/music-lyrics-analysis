Promise not to tell?
Someone's slipped me aqua toffana
To ensure i don't get well

Nobody believes me
When i tell them so
I say, "i've been poisoned!"
And they just stare
And ask me how i know

Well

I can feel it
I can feel it
I can feel it

Fingers at my window
Grey man at my door
He know's what i'm writing, but darling only
I know who it's for

Oh, how very quickly
My tenure was spent
I had so much promise that oftentimes
I wonder where it went
You might also likeFluster, change the subject
Won't make me forget
I know Death is lurking
I just haven't seen
Or heard It yet

But

I can feel It
I can feel It
I can feel It

O-ho-ho

I can feel It
I can feel It
I can feel It

And if i die tomorrow
That will show you then
Leave me to my sorrow, my bill collectors
And my requiem
Leave me to my sorrow, my bill collectors
And my requiem
La la la la la la la la
