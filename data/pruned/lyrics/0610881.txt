We don't give [?] in what we're told
Cause I just don't give a fuck
We just wanna party all night long
Cause I just don't give a fuck
Cause I just don't give a fuck
I just don't give
I just don't give a fuck
I just don't care

[Verse 1: Daye Jack]
I'm a loser, I'm a child
I'm the one who lost his mind (oh get away)
(Oh get away)
Stupid kid, no control
When you ever gonna grow (Just let me be)
(Just let me be)

[Verse 2]
I don't ever want to be the guy who leaves us all to get [?]
I can be your betterment, but that's my choice you understand
Lets party, drinking, fucking, somethin' (I do my thing)
(I do my thing)
(I do my thing)

[Hook]
