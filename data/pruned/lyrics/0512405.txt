Now I get the check, get the check, get the check
It's the problem of yours
When I heard the news I got worried
You gotta know if you ever give up on me, if you ever give up on me

I know I know there's nothing to it
What a thing to say
Oh it's a problem of mine, oh about time you can find
Just stand up and walk away

Sanitize me, honest, I'll be
Ultra violently, rewind, rewind me
Tapes get older, tapes they get slower
Hold me closer, it's not over

Wait up, wait up, wait up, what's the hurry?
Just get off the phone, get off the phone, get off the phone, you I'm talking to you
When I saw the tapes I got lonely
Find a place to review the tapes and they got us on growing up

Wait up wait up wait up, just what's the hurry
What a thing to say
Oh its' a problem of mine, oh about time you get by
Just get up and walk away

Fall in line, please remind, remind me
Tapes get older tapes they get slower
Hold me closer, it's not over

Sanitize me, honest, I'll be
Ultra violently, rewind, rewind me
Tapes get older, tapes they get slower
Hold me closer, it's not over
