Codeine in my system
Weed blurring my vision
She can take a sip of my drank
Fuck hoes and don't call â€˜em
Hit and leave with no warning
If I'm there in the morning
She better cook me something to eat
Turkey bacon eggs with the omelet, fries
Big butt ,wet mouth , warm fire
She hates what all they call
Queue 35 infinite, I ain't seen the bitch in a minute
She be hoping on on that trichet trying to get a piece of the rock
Pussy wet and envision it, if you're too slow to get it
I like white surfer women that are often pops their pop
Long blond hair with the blue eyes
Fake tits or ex ball players

(Pre-Hook)
These the flyest hoes that I've seen
They all getting money like me so
I'm rolling , may goes come everywhere we go
Call real silent and bees on
I just pour for that lean so
They rolling , may goes come everywhere we go

Ye my man fucked your bitch , watch your back
Don't you slip, don't you trip
Take her on the trip, let her trip trip
Fucking run, so much fun
Ye you're one , you ain't one
Rolling , main hoes come everywhere we go

(Verse)
Suppose that grime cripple and crazy
Low, lusty and lazy
Bitch tryin' to give a nigga the rabies
Good thing I got me a shot
Some chose up to pay me
On vacations they take me with
The winter time's like 80
We just eat, fuck and we shop
She pop pills and I slip lean
She drink wine and we smoke weed
Know me it's AOB we just eat, fuck and we shop
And we fuck , she so loud that the neighbors calling the cops
And her sister mad 'cause of knocking from the head board it won't stop
And I stop, long enough to get my ass up and get out
On the next month on my paper brought a little leaf and looked around

(Pre-Hook)
These the flyest hoes that I've seen
They all getting money like me so
I'm rolling , main hoes come everywhere we go
Call real silent and bees on
I just pour for that lean so
They rolling , main hoes come everywhere we go
(Hook) x3
Ye my man fucked your bitch , watch your back
Don't you slip, don't you trip
Take her on the trip, let her trip trip
Fucking run, so much fun
Ye you're one , you ain't one
Rolling , main hoes come everywhere we go
