There were bells on the hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
'Til there was you

[Verse 2: Kim Weston]
Mmm, there were birds in the skies
I never saw them winging
I never saw them at all
'Til there was you

[Bridge: Marvin Gaye]
And there was music
And there was wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew

[Verse 3: Kim Weston]
There was love all around
I never heard it singing
I never heard it at all
'Til there was you

[Bridge: Marvin Gaye]
There was music, ah, hey, hey
Wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
You might also like[Verse 3: Kim Weston]
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
I never heard it at all
'Til there was you

[Outro: Marvin Gaye & Kim Weston]
Hey, hey, hey, sweet loveable you
Oh, wonderful you
I'm crazy, crazy for you
Nothing compares to you
Ooh
