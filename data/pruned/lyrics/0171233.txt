Do you remember what the kiss led to?
I remember it all too well
I took you for dinner into my hotel room

Did you consider it, the future?
I didn’t figure you a liar but you were
Such a beautifully painted picture
Fading into the hurt

Was it just the moment? x2
Was it all that you wanted
Or was it just the moment?

Was it just the moment? x2
Was it all that you wanted
Or was it just the moment, the moment?

Why all the mystery and what for?
The more you twisted it the worse off it was
I was looking for something deepER
Everything I believed that you were

You, the rich girl comes from a different world
Doesn’t make a difference but you said it so you lied
You might also likeSuch a fool to think I would care

Love faded into the air

Chorus
