Cradle me, I'll cradle you
I'll win your heart with a woop-a-woo
Pulling shapes just for your eyes
So with toothpaste kisses and lines
I'll be yours and you'll be...

[Verse 2]
Lay with me, I'll lay with you
We'll do the things that lovers do
Put the stars in our eyes
And with heart shaped bruises
And late night kisses, divine

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
So with toothpaste kisses and lines
Stay with me, I'll stay with you
Doin' things that lovers do
What else to do?You might also like
