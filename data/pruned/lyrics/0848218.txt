Rolling in my sweet baby's arms
I'll lay around the shack
Till the mail train comes back
And rolling in my sweet baby's arms

Well, I ain't gonna work on the railroad
I ain't gonna work on the farm
I'll lay around the shack
Till the mail train comes back
And rolling in my sweet baby's arms

Keep rolling in my sweet baby's arms
I'm rolling in my sweet baby's arms
I'll lay around the shack
Till the mail train comes back
And rolling in my sweet baby's arms

Well, where were you last Friday night
While I was lyin' in jail
You walkin' the streets with another man
You wouldn't even go my bail

Rolling in my sweet baby's arms
I'm rolling in my sweet baby's arms
I'll lay around the shack
Till the mail train comes back
And rolling in my sweet baby's arms
You might also likeGirl, know your daddy don't like me
He drives me away from your door
And if I had it [Incomprehensible] once again
I'll never go there anymore

Keep rolling in my sweet baby's arms
I'm rolling in my sweet baby's arms
I'll lay around the shack
Till the mail train comes back
Rolling in my sweet baby's arms

Lay around the shack
Till the mail train comes back
And rolling in my sweet baby's arms
