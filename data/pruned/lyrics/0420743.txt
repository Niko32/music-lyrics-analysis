You must seduce me, the ties with fire
My one addiction, your sweet desire
Is living in a world of hate and dreams
Standing at the end of time
We had paradise but that was lost
Forever to mankind

[Chorus]
No place for angels, for you and me
No place for angels, I'm lost in your reality
Where life seems so unreal

[Verse 2]
I feel the madness, the Jesus liar
The one creation, obsessed by fire
We're, living in a world of hate and dreams
Standing at the end of time
We had paradise but that was lost
Forever to mankind

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
You may think that I'm just a crazy guy
And I wear the madman's ring
Do I live my life in a fake disguise?
Is my world just caving in (ah)
You might also like[Chorus]
