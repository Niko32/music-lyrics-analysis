Sweet as the flowers in May time
Sweet as the dew on the rose
I would rather be somebody's darling
As a poor girl who nobody knows

[Verse 1]
Oh, mama scolds me for flirting
What is as a poor girl to do
Oh, this world would be sad without a lover
And this world would be sad without you
Oh, I wish I had someone to love me
Someone just to call me their own
Be the rule over somebody's kitchen
Or the queen over somebody's home

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
Oh, what is the use of us parting
Wherever there's a will, there's a way
Tomorrow the sun may be shining
Although it is cloudy today
