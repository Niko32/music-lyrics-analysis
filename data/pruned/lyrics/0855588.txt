Pounding like old knocks upon my door
Breaking like the ocean, washing through my hands
Changing this old mountain into sand

You know me by the stories I have made
You know me by looking out through boxes and cages
And it's hard to clearly see what's right in ordinary light
Does the truth filter down through the ages
We cannot see the end so here we must begin
Tell me, what will we write on these pages?

Life's open road, showing only what it wants to show
Callin' when it's time for us to go
Driven by emotion, pushing from the past
Runnin' till our spirit's free at least

You know me by the stories I have made
You know me by looking out through boxes and cages
And it's hard to clearly see what's right in ordinary light
Does the truth filter down through the ages
We cannot see the end so here we must begin
Tell me, what will we write on these pages?

Down through history we race across
Borders into empty space we write
A chapter of fable, a line, a trace
Another heart may follow
You might also likeYou know me by the stories I have made
You know me by looking out through boxes and cages
And it's hard to clearly see what's right in ordinary light
Does the truth filter down through the ages
We cannot see the end so here we must begin
Tell me, what will we write on these pages?

We cannot see the end, so here we must begin
Tell me, what will we write on these pages?
