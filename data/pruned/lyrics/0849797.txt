We come home waitin tired sleepin wide awake at night
We get to talkin about our feelings
Then we fight and
It's the same old story
Never work it out
You say its not worth the bother
Whats the fuss about oh baby
We argue constitantly about how its supposed to be
You say im paranoed and put all the blam on me
Its the same old thing we're going over again
And now im starting to wonder if its worth all the pain

What do I have to do
What do I have to say
You haven't said a word
Don't you think that its a little strange
You might also like-Chorus-
It's gonna take three small words to turn this love around
Three small words baby tell me what your waiting for
It's gonna take three small words to turn this love around
Three small words is all that im asking for
Three words Three words Three words
Three words Three words Three words

I'll give you one more chance at dinner bed tomorrow night
I'll make it fair to you and me and candle light
And maybe with the food your gonna find the mood
You'll see what its all about
And ge get it out
But if you still dont say it then you won't get my apree
I'm gonna have to pack my bags get up and leave
And You'll say sorry baby I didn't realize
I didn't know it meant so much well baby what a surprise

Here's what you got to do
What you got to do baby
Here's what you got to say
Got to say
Tell me I'm the only one
The only one
Then maybe i'll stay
-Chorus-
It's gonna take three small words to turn this love around
Three small words baby tell me what your waiting for
It's gonna take three small words to turn this love around
Three small words is all that im asking for

Get it out get it out come on come on
Say what you mean to say its the words
Waitin all day all night for the right time
Never gonna be the right time
Gotta get it out get it out
Yah Come on say it say it
Come on say it say it

-Chorus-
It's gonna take three small words to turn this love around
Three small words baby tell me what your waiting for
It's gonna take three small words to turn this love around
Three small words is all that i'm asking for

How to make it change
You haven't said the words
