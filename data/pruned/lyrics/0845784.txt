Did I tell you I can't breathe anymore, baby?
Do you wanna know something?
I'm not sure what we're fighting for

Did I mention I get no sleep, without something
Weaving in and out of your words keeps me awake
And those controlling planes can't afford to be vague
But, honey that's all that you've been lately

Oh I'm not waiting for you to be here
Oh yeah
Because I know even without you
I could be, yeah
I could be great
I could be great

Have you noticed I've lost interest
In all of this
Are you hearing me or are you even listening?
And you find these ways to turn me against
What I thought I liked about myself

So I'm not waiting for you to be here
Oh yeah
Because I know even without you
I could be, yeah
I could be great
I could be great
You might also likeIt might take some time
To figure out how I
Will make it on my own
And you can't ask me why I
Or when I do anything
Anymore

Because I'm not waiting for you to be here
Oh yeah
Because I know even without you
I could be, yeah

I could be great
I could be great
I could be great
I could be great
I could be
I could be great
I could be great
