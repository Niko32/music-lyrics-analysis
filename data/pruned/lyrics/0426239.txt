I tried to stay on the straight and narrow
But I've walked a crooked path
And I've felt worthy of forgiveness
And deserving heaven's wrath
Right on the money and off by a mile
Ahead of my time and way out of style

[Chorus]
But I'm hanging tough, I haven't had enough
I am not giving up on life or love

[Verse 2]
Well, I try to stay away from the bottle
But I've reached out for the glass
I try to pull back on the throttle
But I still run out of gas
I've been an angel, but never a saint
Hung with the devil, don't nobody faint

[Chorus]

Yesterday's history, today is a chance
Tomorrow is a mystery, so I'm making plans

[Chorus] [x2]You might also like
