(Aye baby it don't even matter, we can do whatever you wanna do)
Yeah

[Verse 1]
I can tell by looking at you
That thing is good
Good good good
I can't help myself around you
I wanna do EVERYTHING
I ain't gonna front I'm upfront
Blatant bout what I want
I want you here right now baby
Looking at me the way that you do
You want me to
And I do t wanna waste no time

[Pre-Chorus]
So make it rain
And let it fall
Down on me
I can't believe that

Your love's so good

[Verse 2]
Outta space I'm on a high too
That shit is good
(Don't let me come down)
Put your lips where I can find you
And take me now now
Run it deep like a running back
Make you run it back
Make me want it bad
Make me want you bad baby
Till the sun comes up and skies blue
Mmm and over again
Oh take it there babe

[Pre-Chorus]
So make it rain
And let it fall
Down on me
I can't believe that
[Chorus]
Your love's so good
So good
Your love's so good
So good
So good to me

[Bridge]
You pulling on my hair
You right between my legs
You kissing on my neck
I'm scratching on your back
I say baby go head
Go hard I said go head
I said go hard I said go head
Baby take it there

[Pre-Chorus]
So make it rain
And let it fall
Down on me
I can't believe that

[Chorus]
Your love's so good
So good
Your love's so good
So good
So good to me
