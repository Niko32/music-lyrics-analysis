Mary Lou, Mary Lou
"This one's for you, and I know you"
I know I said "until the four walls, they fall in,"
But since knee caps have caved in
[I guess it's] "the way it was before
The way it was before"

(No one knows anyone)
"Pretty please, I got to do it, God," I said
"I got the arm, I got the rocket
I wasn't born to be some saint
No, I could rather do what you can't"

And so you snapped your legs on skates
I see you writhe on the bedroom floor
I feel the dirty in every place
A certain light on the certain face
The way it was before
The way it was before
The way it was before

On and on and on and on and on and on
On and on and on...
I'll have to hide those kitchen knives
You might also like[She said]
I know it all, I know everything
The little secrets that you keep
They're gonna haunt your dreams at night
You'll have to hide those kitchen knives

(I know it all, I know everything
Your little brothers can't hide from me
I'm gonna cut your conscience clean
I'm gonna cut you off at the knee)
I know what you want

So, do you ever feel that pain -
The kind I feel on the bedroom floor?
So when you're hanging to bottom rods
I know, I know, I know what you want

I know you're inching for an exchange
I gather that all you young boys do
So, when you're coughing up your case
[Just remember,] they don't know you like I do
They don't know you like I do
The little secrets that you keep
I'm gonna haunt your dreams at night
You'll have to hide those kitchen knives
How could they know you like I...
How could they know you like I...
How could they know you like I do?
How could they know you like I...
How could they know you like I...
How could they know you like I do?
I know you're inching for an exchange
(How could they know you like I...)
I gather that you young boys do
(How could they know you like I...)
So, when you're coughing up your case
(How could they know you like I do?)
They don't know you like I do
They don't know you like I do
They don't know you like I do
They don't know you like I do
But how could they know you like I do?
