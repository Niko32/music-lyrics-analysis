Is it now the time, make a dream arise?
I carry you inside, burning deeply with desire
Burn your blazing fire, tremble through the night

Love, I already know, your face is already shown
Why do I have to go away from my home?
And where will I go? Where will I be?
And when will I know, when will I see you?

Maybe, all my life, I've been waiting, wonder why
Is it now the time, make a dream arise?
I carry you inside, burning deeply with desire
Burn your blazing fire, tremble through the night

All I feel
All you are
All I will
