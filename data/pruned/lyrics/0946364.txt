To the bitter end...

I'm losing my patience
Aware of the consequences
Released by the silence, I sense

I'm losing my patience
It weakens my concentration
I'm missing my guidance, I sense
Violence does no good

Tell me I pray don't fail me
I'm counting off hours
Til you defend to the power of ten
Tell me what are you proving?
Well, is it worth losing?
You said you'd fight till the bitter end

I'm building a shelter
I'm marking my territory
I'm flying my flag
I'll stand
I'll bend for nobody

Tell me I pray don't fail me
I'm counting off hours
Til you defend to the power of ten
Tell me what are you proving?
Well, is it worth losing?
You said you'd fight till the bitter end
You might also likeTell me I pray don't fail me
I'm counting off hours
You said you'd fight till the bitter end

Get to the end, I'm fine if you like it
Get to the end, I'm fine if you like it

Tell me I pray don't fail me
I'm counting off hours
Til you defend to the power of ten?
Tell me what are you proving?
Well, is it worth losing?
You said you'd fight till the bitter end

Tell me I pray don't fail me
I'm counting off hours
(Here to the end, I'm fine if you like it...)
Til you defend to the power of ten?
Tell me what are you proving?
Well, is it worth losing?
(Here to the end, I'm fine if you like it...)
You said you'd fight till the bitter end

Here to the end, I'm fine if you like it
Here to the end, I'm fine if you like it
I, I turn to you, and you alone
Here to the end, I'm fine if you like it
I, I turn to you and you alone...
