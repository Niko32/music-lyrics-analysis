Heart, hey we had this talk
This is where we run, don't walk
Away from her as fast as we can move
Don't you remember what she did
The last time you let her in
Did you forget the pain she put us through?
I wouldn't go there if I were you

[Chorus]
Heart, stick to beating, stop all this feeling
Ain't you tired of being her fool?
When her hips start swaying' my lips start sayin'
Don't you know you're gonna get broke right in two?
I wouldn't go there if I were you

[Verse 2]
Try not to think too much about the fire that's in her touch
How her kiss can make you come unglued
That sweet look in her eyes
It's all part of her disguise
That's the devil wearing that perfume
I wouldn't go there if I were you

[Chorus]
Heart, stick to beating, stop all this feeling
Ain't you tired of being her fool?
When her hips start swayin', my lips start sayin'
Don't you know you're gonna get broke right in two?
I wouldn't go there if I were you
You might also likeCome on now
Aw, don't do it

[Chorus]
So heart, stick to beating, stop all this feeling
Ain't you tired of being her fool?
'Cause when her hips start swayin', my lips start sayin'
Don't you know you're gonna get broke right in two?
Well feet, don't fail me now
Head, don't turn around
'Cause here she comes and she's makin' all the right moves
I wouldn't go there if I were you
I wouldn't go there if I were you
