Don't you misfire to fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Don't you know, honey, that love's a game?
It's always hit or miss, so take your aim
Got to hold on tight, shoot me out of sight

[Refrain]
Don't you misfire to fill me up
With the desire to carry on

[Verse 2]
Don't you misfire to fill me up
With the desire to carry on
Your gun is loaded and pointed my way
There's only one bullet, so don't delay
Gotta time it right, fire me through the night

[Chorus]
Come on, take your shot
Fire me higher
Don't you miss this time
Please, don't misfire, misfireYou might also like
