All I hear is raindrops, falling on the rooftop
Ooh, baby, tell me why'd you have to go
'Cause this pain I feel, it won't go away
And today, I'm officially missing you
I thought that from this heartache
I could escape
But I fronted long enough to know
There ain't no way
And today, I'm officially missing you

[Chorus]
Ooh, can't nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do
Hey baby, say, it stays on my mind
And I, I'm officially

[Verse 2]
All I do is lay around, two ears full of tears
From looking at your face on the wall
Just a week ago you were my baby
Now I don't even know you at all
I don't know you at all
Well, I wish that you would call me right now
So that I could get through to you somehow
But I guess it's safe to say, baby
It's safe to say that I'm officially missing you
You might also like[Chorus]
Ooh, can't nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do
Hey baby, say, you know it stays on my mind
And I, I'm officially

[Bridge]
Well, I thought I could just get over you, baby
But I see that's something I just can't do
From the way you would hold me
To the sweet things you told me
I just can't find a way to let go of you

[Chorus]
Ooh, can't nobody do it like you
Said every little thing you do
Hey baby, say, you know it stays on my mind
And I, I'm officially, it's official

[Outro]
You know that I'm missing you, yeah, yes
All I hear is raindrops, ooh, yeah
And I'm officially missing you
