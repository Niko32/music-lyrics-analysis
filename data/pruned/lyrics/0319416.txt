Baby please don't go[x2]
Baby please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Before I be your dog[x3]
I get you way'd out here and let you walk alone

[Verse 1]
Turn your lamp down low[x2]
I beg you all night long baby please don't go
You brought me way down here[x2]
ABout to Rolling Forks you treat me like a dog

[Chorus]

[Outro]
You know your man down gone[x3]
To the country farm with all the shackles onYou might also like
