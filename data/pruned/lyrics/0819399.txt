On a dark day afternoon
Slowly but surely I find I go out of my mind
On the dark side of the moon
Cause no one ever told you it would be this hard
No one gonna break this foolish broken homeless heart
Hold her, I'm gonna hold her

I'm gonna cry
Easy come, easy go
I am who I am and I know what I know

Now I, yeah
I'm gonna be just fine
I'm gonna be just fine
Now I
I'm gonna be just fine
I'm gonna be just fine
You'll see

But I've been bruised, been burned by a light
How can you live with yourself
How can you live with yourself
Cause I don't know what you mean when you say you don't know who I am
I don't care, I don't feel any more, this is not what I plan
Easy come, easy go
I am who I am and I know what I know

I'm gonna be just fine
I'm gonna be just fine
Now I
I'm gonna be just fine
I'm gonna be just fine
You'll see
