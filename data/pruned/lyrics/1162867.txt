Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go back to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby, please don't go

[Verse 1]
Got me way down here
You got me way down here
Before I be your dog
I'll make you alone
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go

[Verse 2]
Turn your lamp down low
Turn your lamp down low
Beg you all night long
A-baby, please don't go back to New Orleans
Baby, please don't go

[Verse 3]
Don't call my name
Don't call my name
Got me way down here wearin' a ball and chain
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go

Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go back to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby, please don't go
