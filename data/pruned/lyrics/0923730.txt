What a hideous forest
Surrounded Whitehaven
Twisted black mountains
Wolves howled in madness
Never I ventured beyond the stone tower
As dusk spread her black wings at the edge of the dark wild wood

[Verse 2]
But one windy evening
Gathering timbers
Under white elm trees
In shadows, I saw her
The darkest of beauties
With her basket of cherries
The wind at her black skirt like the hands of the wild dark wood

[Verse 3]
She turned in her terror
A madness possessed her
In shadow she clawed me
We screamed in the brambles
Hunters came running
With torches and axes
Treetop to treetop, flames tore through the dark wild wood

Back down they dragged us
Past the stone towers
The church bells were ringing
The sky screamed in flashes
But we stood in the church yard
Laughing like jackals
As the stone towers tumbled and bowed to the wild dark wood
