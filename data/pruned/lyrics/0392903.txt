I know you told me
Such a long time ago
Oh, that you didn't want me, girl
No, you said you didn't love me no more

[Chorus]
And I know it's something
What is it that makes me love you the way I do?
Must be that I'm a fool for you
I said I'm a fool for you

[Verse 2]
I know you told me
You didn't want me around
Ooh, but I know, girl
I know you got another guy across town, oh yeah

[Chorus]
And I know it's something
What is it, what is it that makes me love you the way I do?
Must be that I'm a fool for you
Such a fool for you

[Bridge]
Did you ever wake up in the morning, baby
Just about the break of day
With nothing on your mind
But love, love, sweet love
And find your baby's gone away?
Then you break down, go and start crying
Like you never cried before
Even cry so loud, yeah
You wake up all the people upstairs and all next door
Ever since I was one, two, three, four, five-years-old, baby
You know I've been a fool for you
Deep, deep down in my soul, baby
I'm a fool for you
You might also like[Outro]
And I, I know it's something
Oh, it's something that you got that I love
Makes me do what I do
'Cause I'm a fool for you
I, I, I'm a fool for you, yeah
I know I'm a fool for you
