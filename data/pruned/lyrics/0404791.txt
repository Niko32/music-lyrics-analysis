The moonlight is calling your attention
And I don't think I can make a sound
The champagne has died
I heard the cry of what might have been
The sound lights up the air like the stars in the sky
And you don't want to say a word
I rather show you what's on my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
A stitch, a touch, a spit shot of lemonade
On a sunny day, where the kids won't go out to play

[Chorus]
Shadows for suburban homes
I’m so scared of the things that I’ll never know
I put all of my faith in a dial tone
They say they'll be there
But you know they won't
You know they won't

[Verse 2]
The sunlight is demanding your affection
And my eyes won't leave the ground
The champagne, it died
I heard the cries from inside your skin
The shell that top the air like a starlet when she dies
And you don't want to say a word
The eulogies are all mine
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
A snitch, a crutch, a weak spot, a hand grenade
On a sunny day, where the kids won't go out to play

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Welcome to society's idea of a perfect family
With a love straight from a fairy tale
And two perfect little angels
Take a seat, sit right down, and welcome to all of the lies
The attention, the guilt, the hate, the unspoken misery
Cheating, faking, hiding, pretending
Neglecting, demeaning, fighting
The resentment, the drugs, the abuse
Have a seat, get uncomfortable, and enjoy the show

[Pre-Chorus 3]
A stitch, a touch, a spit shot of lemonade
On a sunny day, where the kids go out to play

[Chorus]
