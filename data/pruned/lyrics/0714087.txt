Will you come and safe me?
Wanna be your lady
Give me love, amaze me

Kiss you in the evening
Hug you in the morning
Have you thinking god damn
We're out of control

You know I've been feeling
Like this is the beginning
Wanna know you love me
Like you say you do
Risking you say no
There is a no you never know
What broke me once before
(I can't go for less)

[Verse 3]
What I feel won't go away
So you better be here to stay
I want to fall this heart as bricks
So don't pull tricks on me
When I get down
You breaks me inside
Be mine..

So I have to make you understand
