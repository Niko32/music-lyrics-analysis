Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
Rawhide!

[Verse 1]
Rollin' Rollin' Rollin'
Though the streams are swollen
Keep them doggies rollin'
Rawhide
Rain and wind and weather
Hell-bent for leather
Wishin' my gal was by my side
All the things I'm missin'
Good vittles, love, and kissin'
Are waiting at the end of my ride

[Chorus]
Move 'em on (Head 'em up!)
Head 'em up (Move 'em on!)
Move 'em on (Head 'em up!)
Rawhide!
Cut 'em out(Ride 'em in!)
Ride 'em in (Cut 'em out!)
Cut 'em out
Ride 'em in
Rawhide!

Keep movin', movin', movin'
Though they're disapprovin'
Keep them doggies movin'
Rawhide
Don't try to understand 'em
Just rope, throw, and brand 'em
Soon we'll be livin' high and wide
My heart's calculatin'
My true love will be waitin'
Be waitin' at the end of my ride

[Chorus]
Move 'em on (Head 'em up!)
Head 'em up (Move 'em on!)
Move 'em on (Head 'em up!)
Rawhide!
Cut 'em out(Ride 'em in!)
Ride 'em in (Cut 'em out!)
Cut 'em out
Ride 'em in
Rawhide!

Yah! (whip crack)

Head 'em up (Move 'em on!)
Move 'em on (Head 'em up!)
Rawhide!
Cut 'em out (Ride 'em in!)
Ride 'em in (Cut 'em out!)
Cut 'em out
Ride 'em in
Rawhide!

[Bridge]
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Yah! (whip crack)
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rollin' rollin' rollin'
Rawhide
Yah! (whip crack)
