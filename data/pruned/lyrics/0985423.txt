Somebody's waiting back home in Dallas
With no idea where she has gone
Got her suitcase all packed up
In the back of the pickup
Got her red knee-high Luccheses on
She's on any old two-lane
Westbound she knows
She was chasing her shadow
When the sun finally rose
And man, she's just running
It don't matter where
She figures she'll know where she is when she's there

[Chorus]
And she didn't leave nothin' she can't do without
That's enough reason for leavin', no doubt
She rolls down the window, turns up a song
Laughs at the weather and says, "Hello, I'm gone"

[Verse 2]
She broke down in Lubbock
Got it stuck in reverse
So she hitched down the highway
Her little gun in her purse
Got to the station
Stared at the phone
Found herself thinkin' about calling for home
You might also like[Chorus]
But she didn't leave nothin' she can't do without
And that's enough reason for leavin' no doubt
She dropped in a quarter, made herself strong
All that she told him was, "Hello, I'm gone"

[Outro]
Then she called up a tow truck
Said, "Fix up what's wrong
I'm paying in cash, boys
Hello, I'm gone"
