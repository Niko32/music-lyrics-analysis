As the dawn it breaks
There's a silence
Like the world
Has got nothin' left to say

And my stained-glass heart
Lays shattered
On the floor
Of the Church of One
Yeah it's time, oh it's time

I waited for soul whispers
Tellin' me to be strong
How long did we sleep for?
We gotta get these children home

Yes the song of my soul is sweet
Like a blackbird 'gainst a night sky
Human eyes can't see
But to feel it is salvation
So wild and free
No destiny
No destiny

I waited for soul whispers
Tellin' me to be strong
How long did we sleep for?
We gotta get these children home
I waited for soul whispers
Comin' from on high I know
We will fly right over the temple
Spread your wings its time to go
You might also likeTime to rise
Time to reach for that love
That was there in your infant eyes
Time to believe again
Time to reap again
Yeah it's time, oh it's time

I waited for soul whispers
Tellin' me to be strong
How long did we sleep for?
We gotta get these children home

I waited for soul whispers
Tellin' my heart to grow
We will fly right over the temple
Spread your wings its time to go
