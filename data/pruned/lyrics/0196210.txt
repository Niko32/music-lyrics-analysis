Well, there's something 'bout a woman with my T-shirt on
Hair in her eyes and no make-up on
Standing there smiling with my coffee cup
Yeah, there's something 'bout a woman that's easy to love

[Verse 2]
Yeah, there's something 'bout a woman
That's a clear blue sky
Haven't found nothing better that'll get you high
You're the colors of the sun at the end of the day
Yeah, there's something 'bout a woman that makes you feel that way

[Chorus]
She's like a fire on the mountain
Like some kind of heaven that's pouring down on me
She's a child
She's a lady
She's got everything that I could ever need
Yeah, there's something 'bout a woman and me

[Verse 2]
Yeah, there's something 'bout a woman when she gets fixed up
Slips a red dress on and her eyes light up
I love to watch her walking from across the room
Yeah, there's something 'bout a woman
And the way she moves me
She moves me
Oh, she moves me
You might also like[Chorus]
She's like a fire on the mountain
Like some kind of heaven that's pouring down on me
She's a child
She's a lady
She's got everything that I could ever need
Yeah, there's something 'bout a woman and me

[Bridge]
She moves me
She moves me
Oh, she moves me
She's like fire on the mountain
Like some kind of heaven that's pouring down on me
She's a child
She's a lady
She's got everything that I could ever need
Yeah, there's something 'bout a woman and me

[Outro]
Yeah, there's something 'bout a woman that makes me still
There's something 'bout a woman that always will
