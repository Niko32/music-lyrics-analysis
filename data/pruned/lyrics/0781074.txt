Run your fingers through my hair and softly kiss my lips
Hold me close in your embrace and love me face to face

[Chorus 1: Alabama]
Face to face, heart to heart, body to body
Tingling tangle feelings, lovers face to face

[Verse 2: Alabama]
I'll caress your body and hold you close to me
I'll slide my hands around your waist and love you face to face

[Chorus 2: Alabama]
Face to face, heart to heart, body to body
Lips on lips, arm and arm, body to body
Tingling tangle feelings, lovers face to face

[Verse 3: K.T. Oslin, Alabama, Both]
Softly say you love me as you make love to me
No one else can take your place
We happen face to faceYou might also like
