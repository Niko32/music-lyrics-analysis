(Do Do Do Do)
I'm just walking along mmmm
Hummin' a tune cause I'm blue
I can't sleep a wink, and I do nothing but think
I'm humming the blues over you
(mmmm do do do do)

I'm so lost in the world of sad dreams
Dreams that didn't come true
You took back your heart and my world fell apart
Now I'm hummin' the blues over you
(mmmm do do do do)

I don't even know what day it is
And what's more I don't care
All I know is I'm lost without you
And I'm silently saying a prayer
Well I'm walking along mmmm
Hummin' the blues over you

I'm praying you'll return
And say your lesson you learned
Cause you been hummin' the blues for me too
(mmmm do do do do)
