With them sugar coated lips
We'll leave you hypnotized
Wanting every single bit
Don't you dare stop

[Verse 1: Dahvie Vanity]
Baby girl, trade you up for an upgrade
Silly toy, blowing up like a grenade
You can hate, discriminate
But you won't get my sweet taste
Oh no, blog about it on MySpace

[Pre-Chorus: Dahvie Vanity & JayyVon]
I will be your lovely death
I'll eat you until there's nothing left
I will be your lovely death
I'll eat you until there's nothing left!

Just leave me be, suck the life right out of me
Just leave me be, stay away far from me
Sweet and lush, love is like a sugar rush
Just can't get enough of your toxic love

I will be your lovely death
I'll eat you until there's nothing left
I will be your lovely death
I'll eat you until there's nothing left!

With them sugar coated lips
We'll leave you hypnotized
Wanting every single bit
I'll give you what you want
I'll make your jaw drop
Cause I like it on top
Til I make your heart stop
[Bridge: Dahvie Vanity & JayyVon]
I give up, don't know what to do
This is obviously so untrue
You can never find the truth
When you start to fall in love
It's like an addicting drug
You can never get enough
Through the sun, piercing with them devil eyes
One kiss of my lips will leave you mesmerized
Give you what you lack
Turn your world black
Sit back and relax
Sugar rush
Sugar rush

I'll give you what you want
I'll make your jaw drop
Cause I like it on top
Til I make your heart stop
Don't you dare stop
Don't you dare stop
Til I hit the spot
Sugar rush
I'll give you what you want
I'll make your jaw drop
Cause I like it on top
Til I make your heart stop
Sugar rush
