She's the fake diamond kind
Now she's staring right through me
With her cold gray eyes

Shooting right through me
Is it a truth or a lie? 'Cause
Friendship and love, they go together
Friendship and love, they belong together

Now everybody knows that
She's the fake diamond kind
A little rough around the edges
But so shiny on the inside

All she needs is a little love
A little sunshine
To keep her soul from crying out loud
So let her soul cry out loud

She never says what she needs 'cause
She's her own diamond mine
Shakes it up, sets me free
Yeah, she make the whole world right

She's the only one I need, yeah
She's my heart's delight, 'cause
Friendship and love, they go together
Friendship and love, they belong together
