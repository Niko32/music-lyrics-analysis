I can’t sleep
Dry red eyes wide open
Stare at the white stucco ceiling
I turn on the TV
Watch music on television
Have I heard this song before?
Did this already happen?

Derived influence in style of dress
Similar trends in camera technique and editing
Sync up the cuts to the bass drum kick
All the taste makers drinking from the same glass

Is there anybody thinking what I am?
Is there anybody thinking what I am?

[Chorus]
Are you restless like me?
Are you restless like me?
Are you restless like me?

[Verse 2]
All the insiders rumor over the decline in sales
All the buzz is happening in the new digital market place
FBI warning printed on the flip side
Under penalty of law, piracy will be prosecuted
You might also likeIn MRR someone asks the question
“With the instant availability of information
And content so easily obtainable
Is the culture now a product that’s disposable?”
All the punks still singing the same song

Is there anybody thinking what I am?
Is there any other alternative?

[Chorus]
Are you restless like me?
Are you restless like me?
Are you restless like me?
Like me
