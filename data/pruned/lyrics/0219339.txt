Don't you drive me away
Baby, please
Don't you drive me away

Now, you know I want you, need you by my side
My love for you I'll never hide
Now, if you love me you will hear my plea
Put me out and that's the end of me
Baby, please
Don't you drive me away

One more thing, honey
You know I want you, I love you so
I'll never, never, never, never, never let you go

Baby, please
Don't you drive me away

Oh, yeah

Please don't you drive me away
Don't you hear me telling you
Oh, don't you drive me away

Let me tell you
You know I need you, want you by my side
My love for you I'll never hide
If you love me, won't you hear my plea
Put me out and that's the end of me
