I take back any time I said I'm not human
I am human
Maybe I'm just more clued in than most as a rapper
I've jus barely got my shoe in
But my foot fits in it and I do infinite go green like in Finland
My team will stay winning
I'm done with day trimming
For pay that's no living
I stay on the tip of
My toes to show willingness
To go
I host a dope flow
Never abandon post
I won't
I got code
Written deep within my soul
I know I'm still searching for that glittering gold
But there's so many distractions that it's getting hard to hold
Onto all of my dreams
I see em slowly getting cold
As their beat starts to slow
Dreams of filling venues
Dreams of going pro
Oh no I just can't let go
I won't. Ever. And I don't want to
You might also like[Hook]
Maybe I'm the greatest
Maybe I'll be famous
Maybe maybe I won't make it
Maybe I should face it
Maybe I can't take that
So lets all get wasted
Forget I even said shit
Maybe that will help it
Maybe I should give up
Maybe I should quit now
Maybe that would save me
Lots of disappointing shit huh
Maybe I should smoke less
But maybe I still love it
Whole lotta maybes
Maybe I'll just say fuck it
*click* Fuck that shit!

[Verse 2]
Shout out to chance the rapper
He's such a happy trapper
Follow that wolfpack and kaepernick send yo ass backwards
Where's the antlers
I ain't see them on these bucks
And the answer?
Well it's zero
If you ask how many fucks
Close your mind and open up
With that task I give you luck
Building caskets for the rappers
So they have a place to lay after
I slay them
Spittin daggers
Using this vocab to grab a mad chance at rapping in places where I used to to watch at
And status to match it
But tragically
The show gon have to drop some acts
To fill them with someone who can actually rap
Imagine that
Ha I'm just an idiot
Or wait a second
Did that kid
Just say what I think he did?
Holy shit
I think he did
Maybe there's some truth in it
So listen
You gettin
Pushed like a piston
If you want my advice
Then stop pissing on yourself
And find someplace to stick your dick in
[Hook]

[Verse 3]
Uhh college
Yes I'm ready there's no doubt in my mind
I'm gon demolish
Keep my eyes looking forward
At the girl that's like a sauna
Hot as fuck she got me sweating
Not a problem
But I could use a little water
And I could use some good karma
I'm a teeter totter
An what I wanna be
Is on some marajuana u know I got it
Probably not wearin designer
I ain't fuck with None a that shit
Expensive
So fuck it
I'll jus get my drug kit
And get lit and drunk kid
I'm stumbling and mumbling
So why you on some dumb shit
No frontin just loving
So just pick your poison
Your substance
To make you feel like nothing
Can drag you down
Huh bitch
Hold up we're goin home later
Cuz we turnt up
The volume of the speakers
Till they blow up
Baby nice ta meet ya
Wit the big ol butt
And you know what?
[Hook]
