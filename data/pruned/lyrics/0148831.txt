Probably wasn't supposed to be here
But heels off around 1 o'clock, supposed to meet me here
Hey girl, don't stop, red wine on the table, underwear on the floor
Come and pick a movie that we won't watch
Spend a couple weeks out West, dig your nails in my chest
Unzip that vest, I won't protest
That shoulder ain't cold but tonight sure is
The light fixtures fallen at the sight of her skin
And we're sweating, and we're burning the fuel ain't running out, I think she's learning
Electrifying, now it's a static shock from her kiss
And now we're in the mix, that's how it all begins
Girl, don't leave too early, lean on me cause this body sturdy

[Hook: David]
Her new red nails scratching my back
Kissing her neck, make her witness my act
Bridgin' the gap, givin' no slack
Making her scream, now she throw her head back

And I want it and I'll get it
She'll need it, she'll miss it
And I want it and I'll get it
She'll need it,  she'll miss it

[Verse 2: Carter]
Her big lip matches the exposed brick
My chum like Alex and Ani on her wrist, whose shirt, she asks
I tell her and I insist cause right here is always private
I unhook a bra with the speed of a champion
This my apartment but let's treat it like a mansion
Windows fogged up so you can't see in
She acting hot class but this is what fancy is
Give a girl vibrations in the laundry room
I think you know what I'm saying, yeah, you wanted me
Go coast to coast she wanna follow me
I know she knows it's not up to me
She could let be the sweat in her bellybutton
Let me tell you something that's been bothering me
I'm not home enough to be on top of this, but when I am just holler at me
You might also like[Hook: David]

[Outro]
And I want it and I'll get it
She'll need it, she'll miss it
And I want it and I'll get it
She'll need it, she'll miss it
