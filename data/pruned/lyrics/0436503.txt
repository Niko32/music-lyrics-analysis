After a long journey, the final mile
Wish that we walk together all the while
After a mild labor, we both smile
All of the battles that we lost, both of us in denial

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you

[Verse 2]
Another sun is rising
To bed with no delay
The both of us go despising
Not enough time to play
Memories come and then they go
Somewhere far away
Why can't we just get lost together
And spend each and every day doing it?
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you

[Verse 3]
We have danced with royalty
And pimps of the like
You can't please everybody
But such is life
If there was only one thing
In this world that were true
Nothing is better in this world
Than to walk in sand with you

[Chorus]
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
'Cause nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
Nothing's better than to walk in sand
Hand in hand with you
