Lamps in the windows burning bright, over in Santa Fe tonight
Full moon shining down along the border
But the ground is hard and the night is black
Over here by the rail-road track
And I wish to the Lord that I was back in Georgia

[Chorus]
Blue water in the evening sun
Calling me when the day is done
Mama, mama pray for your son

[Verse 2]
All of my life I've been told
That the LA streets was paved with gold
Fame and fortune waiting to reward you
But it didn't take long to understand
California ain't the promised land
But at least a man's a man in Georgia

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
Well the St. Mary's River in the Georgia moonlight
Flowing under the Folkston Bridge
The sun comes up through the long leaf pine trees
Over 'round the Kingsland ridge
I may be here but my mind is still
About 90 miles north of Jacksonville
You might also like[Verse 3]
Well I may not make it, it's a long, long road
But mama I've paid all the debts I owe
And if I don't you know they going to find me trying
They took my songs and they took my soul
They made me hard and they made me old
Hell I just been born, but I feel just like I'm dying

[Chorus]
