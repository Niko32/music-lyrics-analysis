Y'all ain't fuckin' with me, I leave it to beaver
Reach for the mic and meat with the cleaver
Gone off a mixture of the speed and the reefer
Thumbnail cause the Philly to break
Vanilla and grape and I'm higher than hell, shit
My two step caused Chile to quake
One stanza could fill up the tape, now silence yourselves
Gorillas and apes poundin' their chests
Where they comin' from?
Shit, every one of 'em sounds like the next
And we've all been traveling on a road that leads to nothing
Cause your reality was socially constructed
Take the time to question authority
And y'all best expect to see more of me
Unless I get quarantined for spittin' the sickness
And makin' kids disappear like the magician's assistant
'Cept I told that bitch to get in the kitchen
Whereabouts ain't no mystery
I swear the sound waves will shift your feet
And blow your system clean to smithereens
The epitome of brilliance
Glistening among the city street civilians

[Outro: Terminal Knowledge]
And we ride 'til the night turns back to day
Ladies, lemme see them asses sway
Track smash like Cassius Clay
Gimme a glass of Ze
Hash and haze 'til my ass is blazed
And we ride 'til the night turn back to day
TK, Lil Crazed, makin' them asses sway
Track smash like Cassius Clay
Gimme a glass of Ze
Hash and haze, puff pass the jayYou might also like
