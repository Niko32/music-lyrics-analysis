Here's a little song about boots and a darlin' named Nancy

[Verse 1]
You keep sayin' you got something for me
Something you call love, but confess
You've been a messin' where you shouldn't've been a messin'
That's right, someone else is gettin' all your best

[Chorus]
These boots are made for walkin'
That's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

[Interlude]
"This is the part of the song where Billy Strange raised his hand and asked if he could leave the room."

[Verse 2]
You keep lyin' when you oughta be truthin'
And you keep losin' when you oughta not bet
And you keep samin' when you oughta be changin'
Now what's right is right, but you ain't been right yet

[Chorus]
Listen to me - these boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you
You might also like[Interlude]
"And this is the part of the record where everybody said 'Why, that can't be number one!'"

[Verse 3]
You keep playin' where you shouldn't be playin'
And you keep thinkin' that you'll never get burned
Well, I just found me a brand new box of matches
And what she knows, you ain't that time to learn

[Chorus]
These boots are made for walkin'
And that's just what they'll do
One of these days these boots are gonna walk all over you

[Outro]
Put on your boots and I'll put on mine
