Sounds of day are gone
But love is all around you now
And will be till the dawn

So, there's no need to be afraid
All the whole night through
'Cause God has made a promise, child
That He'll take care of you

Stars shine on the window sill
The moon shines through the trees
Angels by your bed tonight
Shine where no one sees

Stars shine on the window sill
The moon shines through the trees
Angels by your bed tonight
Shine where no one sees

All that you've been dreamin' of
Awaits you when you rise
So with the peace that Jesus brings
Close your sleepy eyesYou might also like
