A smashed windshield, the dust on a pickup truck
Shine with silver secrets in the Albuquerque sun
The light makes jewels of pawn shops and drive-thru banks
Wrinkled faces staring out the windows of the laundromat

[Chorus 1]
And even the broken glass scattered in the street
Shines like a thousand diamond rings

[Verse 2]
Neon signs above the old motels
Warehouse stores and strip malls, houses sprawled across the hills
The sunsetâ€™s a bird with wings made out of fire
Parking lots turn to gold as it glides across the sky

[Chorus 2]
And every night from 6 to 6:05
The desert dirt shimmers like a sea of watermelon light
Even the broken glass shattered in the street
Shines like a thousand diamond ringsYou might also like
