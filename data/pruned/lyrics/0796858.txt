Wouldn't it be sweet
If people came with manuals
For bein human beings
With photographs and diagrams
For helpin life make sense
Every answer there in the
Table of contents
Thrown in this world alone
To figure out on our own
When to hang in and when to walk out
How to go on when you've lost someone you love
Who to believe and who not to trust
Where to find hope when your dreams all turn to dust
Send me the manual
I need the manual right now
Send me the manual
And show me how....
Often i seem lost for words
A little unstable

Losin in general
Is there a number that i can call
Cause i'm not gettin it at all
When to hang in and when to walk out
How to go on when you've lost someone you love
Who to believe and who not to trust
Where to find hope when your dreams all turn to dust
Send me the manual
I need the manual right now
Send me the manual
And show me how....

How to forgive what our parents did wrong
When to be silent, when to speak up
How to tell the difference between sex and love
