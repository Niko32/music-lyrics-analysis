She said she always liked
That picture of me
It was something about the light
The blue of the sea
She said, the way that I smiled
A sparkle in my eyes made me shine

[Verse 2]
I remember all those times
I felt so confident
When the black was black
The white was white
The gray, I never saw
All the things we take for granted
We never think they'll change
But, they change, they change

[Chorus]
Time is changing almost everything I know
And I'm not sure where I stand or where I'll end
As black and whites turn to gray
That picture of me starts to fade

[Verse 3]
Sometimes I see
As I look into her eyes
She wonders if I might
Find another life
I'm not sure if she knows who
I am in my mind and she cries
She cries
You might also like[Chorus]
Time is changing almost everything I know
And I'm not sure where I stand or where I'll end
As black and whites turn to gray
That picture of me starts to fade

[Bridge]
Time is changing almost everything I know
And I'm not sure where I stand or where I'll end

[Chorus]
Time is changing almost everything I know
And I'm not sure where I stand or where I'll end
As black and whites turn to gray
That picture of me starts to fade

[Chorus]
Time is changing almost everything I know
And I'm not sure where I stand or where I'll end
As black and whites turn to gray
That picture of me starts to fade
(Starts to fade, starts to fade)

[Outro]
She said she always liked
That picture of me
