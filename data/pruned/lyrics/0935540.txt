Cadillac, black jack, get down
Boot scootin' boogie

[Verse 1]
Out in the country past the city limits sign
Well there's a honky tonk near the county line
The joint starts jumpin' every night when the sun goes down ([?] a good old country band)
They got whiskey, women, music and smoke
It's where all the cowboy folk go to boot scootin' boogie

[Verse 2]
I got a good job, I work hard for my money
When it's quittin' time, I hit the door runnin'
I fire up my pickup truck and let the horses run
I go flyin' down that highway to that hide-a-way
Stuck out in the woods to do the boot scootin' boogie

[Chorus]
Yeah, heel, toe, dosey doe
Come on baby, let's go boot scootin'
Oh, Cadillac, black jack, baby, meet me out back
We're gonna boogie
Oh, get down, turn around, go to town
Boot scootin' boogie
(Get down)

The bartender asks me, says, "Son, what'll it be?"
I want a shot at that redhead yonder lookin' at me
The dancefloor's hoppin' and it's hotter than the fourth of July
I see outlaws, in-laws, crooks and straights
Are all out makin' it shake, doin' the boot scootin' boogie

[Chorus]
Yeah, heel, toe, dosey doe
Come on baby, let's go boot scootin'
Oh, Cadillac, black jack, baby, meet me out back
We're gonna boogie
Oh, get down, turn around, go to town
Boot scootin' boogie
Oh, heel, toe, dosey doe
Come on baby, let's go boot scootin'
Yeah, Cadillac, black jack, baby, meet me out back
We're gonna boogie
Yeah, get down, turn around, go to town
Boot scootin' boogie ([?])

[Interlude]
Heel to toe (Giddy up)
Dosey doe
Cadillac
Black jack
Get down, get down
(Shake it baby)
Get down, get down
Boot scootin' boogie
[Chorus]
Heel, toe, dosey doe
Come on baby, let's go boot scootin'
Oh, Cadillac, black jack, baby, meet me out back
We're gonna boogie
Oh, get down, turn around, go to town
Boot scootin' boogie

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Heel, toe, dosey doe
Come on baby, let's go boot scootin'
Oh, Cadillac, black jack, baby, meet me out back
We're gonna boogie
Get down, turn around, go to town
Boot scootin' boogie
Oh, heel, toe, dosey doe
Come on baby, let's go boot scootin'
Yeah, Cadillac, black jack, baby, meet me out back
We're gonna boogie
Yeah, get down, turn around, go to town
Boot scootin' boogie
I said, get down, turn around, go to town
Boot scootin' boogie
Woah, get down, turn around, go to town
Boot scootin' boogie
