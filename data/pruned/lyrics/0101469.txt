Keep it 100
It's all on the table, eat up if you're able
100
Let her know the real me, even if it kills me
100

[Verse 1]
I never told you lies until I fell in love wit' you, oh-oh
I made up in my mind it was just to protect you

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I feel like such a phony, like I'm not your homie
'Cause if I was, I'd just keep it real
And now you say you wanna know me, really wanna know me
But after this we gon' see how you feel

[Chorus]
If I just keep it 100 (100)
She'd probably be cool with everything
If I just keep it 100 (100)
I wouldn't be 'bout to lose my diamond ring
If I just keep it 100
And tell her how I creep on the low
She wants the truth but do she really wanna know?
If I just keep it 100 (100)
She probably know, but I'll never know unless I
Keep it 100 (100)

I've told so many lies that you won't accept the truth, oh-oh-oh
I've hurt you so many times now your heart is bulletproof

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I feel like such a phony, like I'm not your homie
'Cause if I was, I'd just keep it real
And now you say you wanna know me, really wanna know me
But after this we gon' see how you feel, when I

[Chorus]
If I just keep it 100 (100)
She'd probably be cool with everything (If I)
If I just keep it 100 (100) (Yeah)
I wouldn't be 'bout to lose my diamond ring (My diamond ring)
If I just keep it 100
And tell her how I creep on the low (Creep on the low)
She wants the truth but do she really wanna know?
If I just keep it 100 (100)
She probably know, but I'll never know unless I (Unless I)
Keep it 100 (100)

[Bridge]
You ain't gotta sneak through my phone, I'ma let you know what it is
I ain't blaming no alcohol, I'ma just man up for what I did (I did)
I told her I had a girl, it made her want me more
Next thing I know we up in the suite rolling all on the floor
When you kept on asking every time I said, "Nothing, love" and I know you knew
I was trying to tell you but I didn't 'cause I knew that you'd say we were through
I'm glad I got it off my chest, but that don't make it cool
That's what I've decided, and I'll always wanna be with you
[Chorus]
If I just keep it 100 (100)
She'd probably be cool with everything
(She'd probably be cool with everything)
If I just keep it 100 (100)
I wouldn't be 'bout to lose my diamond ring
If I just keep it 100
And tell her how I creep on the low
She wants the truth but do she really wanna know?
If I just keep it 100 (100) (Keep it 100, oh)
She probably know, but I'll never know unless I
(But you never know, oh) Keep it 100 (100)

[Outro]
Keep it 1, 1 wit' you
Let me keep it 1, keep it 1 wit' you
(Keep it 100)
Keep it 1, 1 wit' you
Keep it 1, keep it 1, keep it 1
(Keep it 100)
It's all on the table, eat up if you're able
(Keep it 100)
Let her know the real me, even if it kills me
(Keep it 100)
