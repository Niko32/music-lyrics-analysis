I thought you were lovely
And stared at the ground
I'll follow you wherever you go

Rabbit season ended when I shot up the hole
They said you were missing
Except for your bow
Which floated on the wind sailored snow

I appear from air whenever you're around
You breathe me into being
Let me muscle through your crown
And when you tear me up don't fear me
I'll be a mess for miles around
On a beauty strike from birth to you

I saw you in town
I fingered you down
I thought you were lovely
And stared at the ground
I'll follow you wherever you go

Rabbit season ended when I shot up the hole
They said you were missing
Except for your bow
Which floated on the wind sailored snow
You might also likeI appear from air whenever you're around
You breathe me into being
Let me muscle through your crown
And when you tear me up don't fear me
I'll be a mess for miles around
On a beauty strike from birth to you

I appear from air whenever you're around
Breathe me into being
Let me muscle through your crown
And when you tear me up don't fear me
I'll be a mess for miles around
On a beauty strike from birth to you
