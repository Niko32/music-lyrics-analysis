To believe is to deceive
Down on knees you're choked on memories
Turned into lies of pure demise
Below to lay far beyond the day

[Pre-Chorus]
A wretched fate
At the point of no return
Doomed to crawl
Into the darkest of deaths

[Chorus]
Forever ceased to be
Ways to the grave

[Verse 2]
A flickering mind in the life rewind
Thoughts pierced and hanged on hooks
Suffering hell inside a human shell
Your body will break and crack to dust
Die

Die, it's time to pay for all your sins
Die, consciousness devoured by a cell of soil
Die, punished and doomed as a liar
Die, hope shall be buried with maggots to coil
You might also like[Verse 3]
The presence fades away to betray
All your hope is gone
There is none there to bring light
And out of sight you pay in mental decay

[Pre-Chorus]
A wretched fate
At the point of no return
Doomed to crawl
Into the darkest of deaths

[Verse 4]
It all ends here in euphoria and fear
The last sight is your only light in total pain
Portrayed insane
Lungs burst by vomits nursed

[Pre-Chorus]
A wretched fate
At the point of no return
Doomed to rot
Into the darkest of deaths

[Chorus]
Forever ceased to be
Ways to the grave
Forever ceased to be
Ways to the grave
