Sitting on top of the telephone
Little lady, I want to see us go on
Her smile face didn't go the way around
She packed her bags and left this town
She run off with another no good man

I tell me now, honey
Who's gonna star in your movie Mazelle
Who'll pay the big shot in your scene
Who's gonna star in your movie Mazelle
Well hit me, hammer me on your silver screen

Three days now and I can't eat a thing
Waiting here for the phone to ring
Now it does and suddenly I'm not afraid
Hello baby, how do you feel
You coming home, well that's unreal
Before you do, I've got something to say

Who's gonna star in your movie Mazelle…

You say he's out of your system for good
You're gonna treat me like a woman should
That sounds fine, but I'm not buying any lying
I played at love and dressed like you
But now only the real thing will do
No more games baby, I ain't got no time
