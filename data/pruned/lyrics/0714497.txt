I wasted so much time believing
That in this life
You'd try and get all you can take
But all along what I've been needing
Was to find just one good reason
To give myself really give myself away

[Chorus:]
Every smile that lights my face
Every teardrop every trace
Every secret hidden place
Belongs to you
Anything that's good in me all I ever hope to be
Every drop of every dream belongs to you

[Verse 2:]
You know the me that I remember always thought you had to keep it all inside
Getting trouble being tender
So you never say surrender
It took you finally prove me wrong

[Chorus]

[Outro:]
I'm letting go
I'm letting go now
But everything I ever held on to
Every place I've ever been
Every chance I'll get again
Every secret every sin belongs to you
Anything that's good in me
All I ever hope to be
Every drop of every dream belongs to you
It all belongs to youYou might also like
