Fresher than some peppermints
Clean up all the evidence
It's evident I fucked your bitch
Right up in your residence

[Hook: Drew Digga]

[Verse 1: Spaid]
Two pounds of marijuana
Me and myself make a ?
Did it for the dollars I got drugs I got honor
Wildin' as a juvenile, look just like my momma
Made these street holla when you sweet as peach cobbler

[Verse 2: Drew Digga]
I'm in love with dirty dollars ? My momma
Let's be brief with the case motherfuck your honor
Keep a knot like Barrack, I won't change like Obama
Loyalty and success, death before dishonor

[Verse 3: Spaid]

Wake up with a brick go to bed with two
No seeing or no telling what these Feds will do

Police wanna' cuff me, cracker hope you can out run me
My daddy from the wood, no camouflage we ain't hunting

[Verse 9: Spaid]
How could something mean everything mean nothing
To someone who don't know shit about hustling and struggling
Don't underestimate the power of an onion
Making power moves word to court Tim Duncan
My money on Goliath your money on Munchkin
I'm plugged in like a motherfucker
Flyer than the Jumpman
