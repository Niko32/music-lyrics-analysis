Feels like floating in the sky
Where the air is sweet
And my body feels so light
And through the dark your eyes light up my face
And all the walls come tumbling down

And I can feel you
As your hands wash over me
I can feel you, as you breathe

CHORUS:
If we only have tonight, then baby let's make it right
Don't wanna go through the night
If I have to let you out of sight
Just wanna be lying here
Wrapped up in candlelight

VERSE 2:
I see you and I feel you moving closer
I'm letting go as I lose control
And I want you oh I need you
Like nothing in this world matters now

And I believe you
When say you've never been this swept away
I can feel you through my veins
You might also likeCHORUS:
If we only have tonight
Then baby let's make it right
Don't wanna go through the night
Anywhere that you are out of sight
Just wanna be lying here
Wrapped up in candlelight

MID 8:
You say tonight can't last forever
But as long as stars are in the sky
You dont need to doubt the way i feel
Cos the love we made will stay with me forever

CHORUS:
If we only have tonight
Then baby let's make it right
Don't wanna go through the night
Anywhere that you are out of sight
Just wanna be lying here
Wrapped up in candlelight
