Tell me just one more time
The reason why you must leave
Tell me once more why you're sure
You don't need me
Tell me again, but don't think
You'll convince me

[Verse 2]
You said about falling in love again
You'd rather be dead
When someone breaks your heart
You cry your eyes red
There's nothin' so hard about
The life that you've lead

[Pre-Chorus]
As far as I can see
There's no reason for goodbye
You're just running scared
And that's something I won't buy

[Chorus]
So you lose, I won't let you go
There's nothing to show but more blues
All this talk about leavin' is strictly bad news
So you settle down and stay
With the boy that loves you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
As far as I can see
There's no reason for goodbye
You're just running scared
And that's something I won't buy, buy

[Chorus]
So you lose, I won't let you go
There's nothing to show but more blues
And all this talk about leavin' is strictly bad news
So you settle down and stay
With the boy that loves you
Oh, you settle down and stay
With the boy that loves you
Yeah, you settle down and stay
With the boy that loves you
