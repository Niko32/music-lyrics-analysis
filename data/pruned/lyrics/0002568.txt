Walking along just kicking stones
Minding my own business
I come face to face with my foe
Disguised in violence from head to toe

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I holler and I bawl (the Ku Klux Klan)
Them no let me go now (the Ku Klux Klan)
To let me go was not dem intention (they say)
One nigga the less, the better the show
Stand strong black skin and take your blow

[Chorus 1]
The Ku Klux Klan
The Ku Klux Klan
Here to stamp out black man
The Ku Klux Klan

[Verse 2]
To be taught a lesson not to walk alone
I was waiting for the Good Samaritan
But, but, but waiting was hopeless, it was all in vain
The Ku Klux Klan back again

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I holler and I bawl (the Ku Klux Klan)
Them no let me go now (the Ku Klux Klan. they say)
One nigga the less, the better the show
Stand strong black skin and take your blow
You might also like[Chorus 2]
The Ku Klux Klan
The Ku Klux Klan
Rape, lynch, kill and maim
Things can't remain the same you know!

[Verse 3]
Black man, do unto the Klan as they would do to you
In this case, hate thy neighbour
Those cowards only kill who they fear
That's why they hide behind the hoods and cloaks they wear

[Pre-Chorus 3]
I holler and I bawl (the Ku Klux Klan)
Dem no let me go (the Ku Klux Klan)
Oh no, oh no

[Chorus 3]
The Ku Klux Klan
The Ku Klux Klan
Here to stamp out black man
Rape, lynch, kill and maim
Things can't remain the same you know
