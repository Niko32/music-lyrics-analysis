You're the best girl ever
The only girl that put in effort
To make me feel like some kind of a king
And not just want some silly little fling

And I know you didn't ask for this
But K I love you and you're worth more than this
I'd give you the entire world
As long as you always let me call you my girl


Verse 1:
This here's a dedication, to my girlfriend
You're so perfect for me baby you're a godsend
I used to think that I would never fall in love
Or find that special person that I knew id always trust

But then I met you and at first I was a bit nervous
My quiet shy self for about 30 minutes
But that night we just seemed to lose track of time
Learned more about you, started wishin you were mine

And I was so surprised, you asked me out again
I thought I failed horribly in that circumstance
But then you kissed me bye, I felt like I could fly
For the first time in my life my soul felt alive
You might also likeWalking on sunshine, couldn't wait to see you
Wanted to talk all night but it was too soon
And baby you changed the way I look at life
So when I lay awake in bed I think of you every night

Chorus:
You're the best girl ever
The only girl that put in effort
To make me feel like some kind of a king
And not just want some silly little fling

And I know you didn't ask for this
But K I love you and you're worth more than this
I'd give you the entire world
As long as you always let me call you my girl

Verse 2:
We've been together Two Days you call it honeymoon
You got me caught up in your spell and i'm in love with you
And It's funny too, cause it was never expected
It's like god touched my life, divine intervention

I'll never ever make you beg for my attention baby
I'll never ever sneak around, flirtin' actin' shady
Call me whipped, call me stupid, call me really crazy
Call me anything as long as I can call you my lady
I know that the future seems a bit hazy Now
If I wasn't so poor babe I'd take you out
For your birthday or for just getting some chow
I'd buy you anything you wanted even a house

This song is an expression of my love for you
I wrote this song from the heart, hope you feel it too
So whenever you hear that piano intro tune
You'll always know who this song is dedicated to

Chorus:
You're the best girl ever
The only girl that put in effort
To make me feel like some kind of a king
And not just want some silly little fling

And I know you didn't ask for this
But K I love you and you're worth more than this
I'd give you the entire world
As long as you always let me call you my girl
