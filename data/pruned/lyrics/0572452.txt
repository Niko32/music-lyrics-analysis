My piece of mind, My piece of mind
A place where i can go to set my soul at ease
From reality, reality
Another hit and now the sister's flying free
Dependency, she's flying free
Her babies go to sleep without enough to eat
That's reality, their reality you see

Close my eyes and try to block out all this noise
Surrounding me, Surrounding me
The sirens screams the sounds of a ghetto street
That's reality, reality
The babies lose their laughter early in the game
The alcohol intoxicates another brain
My sister gives herself away to ease the pain
Of reality, her reality you see

Reality
That's reality
Reality
That's reality

Somewhere there's a place that I have yet to find
Somewhere there's a place that I have piece of mind
Somewhere there's a place that I have yet to find
Somewhere there's a place that I have piece of mind
The babies lose their laughter early in the game
The alcohol intoxicates another brain
My sister gives herself away to ease the pain
Of reality...You might also like
