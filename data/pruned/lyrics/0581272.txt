You could have had it any way you wanted it
You could have been a real democracy
You could have been free, oh
			
Hey America
Could have had me for your friend and not your enemy
Through your perversion you insist I have to be
Your enemy, oh

I could have loved you more
More than you will ever know
You are my homeland, oh

Hey America
The only thing you can respect
Is violence now
You lost the gift of love
Don't ask me how
But you've lost it now, oh

Hey America
I need to love you more than you can know
I'd give my life if I could save your soul
But you've grown old
And can't change
Cold in your heart
And I'm sad, sad
You might also likeHey America
I can see you now
Hey America
God knows I can see you now
Hey America
I can see you now
Hey America
Land of the free
Home of the brave
Hey America
Hey America
Hey hey America
