Baby baby
I've been staring down your way
Don't know exactly what to say
I'm wondering if you feel the same
Because every time I'm looking down
The questions what you're dancing around
I'm sick of playing silly games

[Pre-Chorus: MNEK]
Tell me, am I the type you go for?
Am I just wasting my time?
Should I carry on? Or should I say no more?
All of the things running through my mind

[Hook: MNEK & Sinéad Harnett]
Oh tell me, tell me baby
Oh tell me, tell me baby oh
Oh tell me, tell me baby yeah
Oh tell me, tell me baby oh
Oh tell me, tell me baby  oh
Oh tell me, tell me baby  yeah
Oh tell me, tell me baby oh
Oh tell me, tell me baby
Baby baby

Every single night and day
I wonder if it's just a phase
Or is it really something here?
Cause whenever that you're near to me
I feel it in our energy
Just pull me out my misery

[Pre-Chorus: Sinéad Harnett]
Tell me, am I the type you go for?
Am I just wasting my time?
Should I carry on? Or should I say no more?
All of the things running through my mind

[Hook: MNEK & Sinéad Harnett]
Oh tell me, tell me baby
Oh tell me, tell me baby oh
Oh tell me, tell me baby yeah
Oh tell me, tell me baby oh
Oh tell me, tell me baby  oh
Oh tell me, tell me baby  yeah
Oh tell me, tell me baby oh
Oh tell me, tell me baby
Baby baby

Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
Baby baby
Baby
