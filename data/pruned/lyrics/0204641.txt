Oh, Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make him mine, mine (Oh, Santa)
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas (Oh, Santa)
Santa's gon' come and make him mine, mine (Oh, oh)

[Verse 1]
Santa
If you get this letter, won't you help me out?
I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now
And I don't know how
You do the things you do while I'm 'sleep on Christmas Eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this void inside and I just can't take it

[Pre-Chorus]
I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night

[Chorus]
Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make him mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas night

Oh, Santa
I heard that it's really gonna snow this year
So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
'Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, ol' Kris Kringle, save me

[Pre-Chorus]
They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you, Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa, won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night?

[Chorus]
Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make him mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas night

[Bridge]
Oh, Santa
Oh, Santa (Oh, oh, oh)
Oh, Santa
Come on, Santa (Oh, Santa)
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas (Oh, Santa)
Santa gon' come and make him mine, mine
Santa gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa gon' come and make him mine, mine (Oh, oh, oh)
[Verse 3]
Oh, Santa Claus
If you get this letter, please don't make me wait
'Cause all December, I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies

[Pre-Chorus]
The tree's all sparkly and gold
But inside, I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa, won't you come and make him mine this Christmas?

[Chorus]
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho (Oh)
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, mine (Santa)
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho (Hey)
Santa's gon' come and make you mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, mine
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make you mine this Christmas (Mine)
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho (This Christmas)
Santa's gon' come and make you mine, mine
Santa gon' come and make you mine this Christmas
