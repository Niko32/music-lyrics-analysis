I don't know why I let go
I want to be your friend
Flowers grow through my window
And I love you again

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I love you, oh
When you laid me down into your beautiful garden
Flowers in the love of my arms
It's God shining through to me, I guess
It's God shining through to me, I guess

[Chorus]
Oh, I love you, Amy
Do you still love me?

[Verse 2]
I go to the places where
We used to, I feel sad
I am out here looking for you
Sometimes I pretend

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I miss you, oh
When you laid me down into your beautiful garden
Flowers in the love of my arms
Is God playing evil tricks on me?
Is God playing evil tricks on me?
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, I love you, Amy
Do you still love me?

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, I love you, oh
When you laid me down into your beautiful garden
Flowers in the love of my arms
Is God playing evil tricks on me?
Was God playing evil tricks on me?

[Chorus]
Oh, I love you, Amy
Do you still love me?
