We had a good thing till he said goodbye
Then with one touch you set my heart ablaze
I'm burnin' old memories with a brand new flame
A perfect match that's what we are
I'm gettin' over him underneath the stars
The smoke has cleared from the hold he had on me
I'm burnin' old memories with a brand new flame
One by one those old embers burn
You came along when I had no where to turn
Just when I thought I'd never love again

I'm burnin' old memories with a brand new flame
When I'm with you I'm without a doubt
We got a fire I don't ever want to put out
And here with you is where I'm gonna stay
Just burnin' old memories with a brand new flame
One by one those old embers burn
You came along when I had no where to turn
Just when I thought I'd never love again
I'm burnin' old memories with a brand new flameYou might also like
