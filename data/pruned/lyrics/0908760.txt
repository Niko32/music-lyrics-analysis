It's all breaking down
Crushed into the ground
But I will love you forever

[Verse 2: Gene Eugene]
It's falling apart
Hopeless and dark
But we're gonna see it
Through together

[Chorus 1: Terry Scott Taylor]
Caught in a landslide
Earthquakes and high tides
It's gonna be a rough ride
But I'll stay by your side

[Verse 3: Terry Scott Taylor]
By grace we remain
With hands in the flame
But I will love you forever

[Verse 4: Michael Roe]
Times may be hard
We're crippled and scarred
But we're gonna see it through together
(We're gonna see it through)
You might also like[Chorus 2: Michael Roe]
Dreams of a lifetime
Way past the deadline
We're pushing up an incline
But I believe we'll be just fine

[Verse 5: Michael Roe]
No money to spend
(Hard times are coming again)
No ship coming in
(We're here through the thick and the thin)
But we're gonna see it through together

[Chorus 1: Gene Eugene]
Caught in a landslide
Earthquakes and high tide
It's gonna be a rough ride
But I'll stay by your side

[Verse 1: Terry Scott Taylor]
It's all breaking down
(Times might be getting too hard)
Crushed into the ground
(Maybe we're crippled and scarred)
But I will love you forever
[Verse 5: Terry Scott Taylor]
No money to spend
(No ship coming in)
No ship coming in
(No money to spend)
But we're gonna see it through together
(We're gonna see it through together)

[Outro]
No ship coming in
No money to spend
