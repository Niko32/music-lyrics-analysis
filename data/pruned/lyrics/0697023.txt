My time to spit a rhyme
My time to read between the lines
My time to get vocals thru the mic

My time to get it right
My time to stay up all night
My time to sip on the sprite
Its my time to find the light

Cos its my time to get out dark
My time to stop trapping in the park
My time to start going in hard
Its my time to not be last

Its my time to graft
Its my time to blast
Its my time to stay on task
Its my time so forget the past
Its nu time so lets live it upYou might also like
