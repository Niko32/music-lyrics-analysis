Talking to God
Hearing what he wants
He moves in violence
I stand in silence
Who can question You, who can fathom You?
In your presence, who can stand?
Worlds spin around and kings crumble down
There's no escape what You've planned

[Verse 2]
Winds approaching, clouds are forming
God in his power
Is swirling around me
Calling me, and you know my name
So jump in or be taken, yea I can't
Run long enough, or go far enough
To escape the screaming rain

[Chorus]
It's alright
It's alright
Jump in the whirlwind
I'm letting go
It's alright
It's alright
Jump in the whirlwind
I'm letting go
You might also like[Verse 2]
My world's at stake
I want to break
Stop the striving
Start the dying
I'm thrown into it
It's so imminent
There's no arguing what You say
I got to keep fanning it, I keep fanning it
I keep fanning the fire to flames

[Chorus]
It's alright
It's alright
Jump in the whirlwind
I'm letting go
It's alright
It's alright
Jump in the whirlwind
I'm letting go
It's alright
It's alright
Jump in the whirlwind
I'm letting go

[Bridge]
Master and Savior, Sustainer and Creator
You move in power
And winds and thunder
[Chorus]
It's alright
It's alright
Jump in the whirlwind
I'm letting go
It's alright
It's alright
Jump in the whirlwind
I'm letting go
It's alright
It's alright
Jump in the whirlwind
I'm letting go
It's alright
It's alright
Jump in the whirlwind
I'm letting go
Letting go â€“ I'm letting go, I'm letting go, I'm letting go
