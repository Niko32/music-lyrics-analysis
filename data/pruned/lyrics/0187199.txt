Hey there, you, shattered in a thousand pieces
Weeping in the darkest nights
Hey there, you, tryin' to stand up on your own two feet, and
Stumbling through the sky

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hey, you, ah)
When the lights go out and you're on your own (Hey, there, hold on)
How you gonna make it through 'til the morning sun? (Morning)

[Chorus]
Sing to the moon and the stars will shine
Over you, lead you to the other side
Sing to the moon and the stars will shine
Over you, heaven's gonna turn the tide

[Verse 2]
Hey there, you, looking for a brighter season
Need to lay your burden down
Hey there, you, drowning in a helpless feeling
Buried under deeper ground

[Pre-Chorus]
(Hey, you, ah)
When the lights go out, it's a waiting game (Hey, there, hold on)
Never gonna see a day when your world will change (Morning)
You might also like[Chorus]
Sing to the moon and the stars will shine
Over you, lead you to the other side
Sing to the moon and the stars will shine
Over you, heaven's gonna turn the tide
Sing to the moon and the stars will shine
Over you, lead you to the other side
Sing to the moon and the stars will shine
Over you, heaven's gonna turn the tide
