Where's the law that says if I make a buck, you've gotta get a cut?
Get the fuck outta my pockets and my eye sockets
Bad programming with a smooth slow jam in the background
That's how you've got us all strapped down
That sound that I hear
You telling us to fear
Like the muthafuckin' earth will end this year
Yeah
It's that same old same old
Actual development is in slow mo
Work a steady day job then go home
You're free to roam anywhere within our zone
Hmmmm
Not really loving all the options?
Here's a little tax break
Now go shopping!
Am I the only one that feels hollow?
A sense of sorrow
From a pre-designed tomorrow?
This world only exists for monetary cause
We should use our mind power to collapse the walls

[Verse Two]
When I use the term "The World"
I'm referring to the complex
Megaplex, that never let's you breathe
"Fly over it"
But it never let's you leave
"And you only know"
Everything it let's you see
O.D. on the norm
Til we all conform
Same attitude, same shoes and ties are worn
Then swarm to the screen, til the images seen
Make you forget to dream, only living for the green and...
Maybe we should take it to the start again
Burn up all the money and then start bartering
Smarter than, this construct
Misconduct
Awe struck
At the fact that we're all fucked!
All ducks in a row, thriving off one mineral
Hurts on the low
So I compose syllables
Visual
This empire's gonna fall
If we use our mind power ti collapse the walls

Take a deep breath
As I give it my best
To flee the realms of stress
Look! now I'm at the top of Everest
At the crest with my Emperess
I suggest, we reside at no particular address
Leave the world behind
See the true divine lack of limitation through creation
It can't be found within the borders of the nation
Patiently I ski on treetops and eavesdrop
As the leaves talk
If there's an earthquake
I let the beat drop
Knees knock in panic
So I cradle the planet
Take a thought and expand it
Til it becomes a mode of transit
And it takes me
Where my imagination finds elation
To define senation
I had to cling to correlation
For a patient waiting in my foyer
I'm like Okoye
Run through
Hit em with that check one two
Travel from the stage to the stone age without a pause
Cause I use my mind power to collapse the walls
