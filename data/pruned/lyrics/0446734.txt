Ever since you left me, I've done nothing but wrong
Many nights I've laid awake and cried
We once were happy, my heart was in a whirl
But now I'm a honky tonk girl

[Chorus]
So turn that jukebox way up high
And fill my glass up while I cry
I've lost everything in this world
And now I'm a honky tonk girl

[Verse 2]
I just can't make a right with all of my wrongs
Every evening of my life seems so long
I'm sorry and ashamed for all these things you see
But losing him has made a fool of me

[Chorus]
So fill my glass up to the rim
To lose my memory of him
I've lost everything in this world
And now I'm a honky tonk girlYou might also like
