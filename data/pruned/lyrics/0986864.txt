I gave it all away I won't see it back again
She says I've lost all feeling;
Oh what's a man supposed to do?

But it's sun down, blood horizon
Now it feels alright
No one fears the darkness
Down in the valley tonight

She hides her diamonds in her secret places drawer
In case our livelihood should fall right through the floor
But in our darkest season
We had some good times even then

Now it's sun down, blood horizon
Now it feels alright
No one fears the darkness
Down in the valley tonight

I watch them come and go, I'll watch them go again
The door is opening now so tonight I'm busting in
We've all got our reasons
Mine's a chance at breaking even now

'Cause it's sun down, blood horizon
Now it feels alright
No one fears the darkness
Down in the valley tonightYou might also like
