Words spoken, my heart open
No, I never had butterflies like that
We danced in the moon glow
Your hands moved slow
You kissed me on the lips
Swore I wouldn't look back
It was just like we were flying in another time

[Chorus]
I felt the world was ours for the taking
When I fell into your eyes
Never a doubt that we would make it if we tried
You promised you'd never break my heart
Never leave me in the dark
Said your love would be for all time
But that was back when you were mine
When you were

[Verse 2]
Here, with me, I thought we'd be
Stronger than the past
Better than the ones before
How did I fool myself in thinking
We had it all?
You might also like[Chorus]
I felt the world was ours for the taking
When I fell into your eyes
Never a doubt that we would make it if we tried
You promised you'd never break my heart
Never leave me in the dark
Said your love would be for all time
But that was back when you were mine
When you were

[Verse 3]
What if this was it, baby?
What if this was our time?
Maybe we're long past saving
But I'm gonna give you one try
You better think twice
Before you leave her behind

[Chorus]
And what if the world was ours for the taking?
When I fell into your eyes
Never a doubt that we would make it if we tried
You promised you'd never break my heart
Never leave me in the dark
Said your love would be for all time
But that was back when you were mine
When we were in love
Do you remember the time
When you were mine?
[Bridge]
Ooh
(That was back when you were mine)
What if this was it, baby?
What if this was our time? (Back when we were in love)
Back when you were mine (That was back when you were mine)
Back when we were in love
In love

[Outro]
You said we'd be together
You said it'd last forever
I guess you never really meant it, baby
Did you, baby?
