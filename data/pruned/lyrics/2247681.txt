The sky is crying
Can't you see the tears roll down the street?
The sky is crying
Can't you see the tears roll down the street?
I've been looking for my baby
And I wonder where can she be

[Verse 2]
I saw my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
I saw my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me so bad, y'all
It made my poor heart skip a beat

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
I've got a bad feeling
My baby don't love me no more
I've got a real bad feeling
My baby don't love me no more
Yeah, the sky's crying, yeah
Can't you see the tears roll down the road
(Alright)
