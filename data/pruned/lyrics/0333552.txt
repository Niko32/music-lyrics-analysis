Who the fuck you think you're tryna test
This could get mess, best get your bullet proof vest
Blud who you think your tryna push
Like I'm gonna keep shush, you must think I'm a puss
Come now who ya tryna be, tryna go on like you're heavy, tryna go on like you're deep
Nah fuck it this is beef, it started in the ends and it will end in the streets

[Verse 1]
There's a bad boy out on the street that roles deep
His best friend is his bucky that's unlucky for some
Especially when he's out on the prowl for fresh meat
Fresh peeps to run up to with his gun
And say "Wagwan my son what's going on here?
Who in the hell does that bre think he is over there?
Dropping off a choon ting in his passenger chair
I'll pull him round with his arrogant stare
That can't run, not while I breathe air
And he'll find that out before I let him leave here, leave here
Come 'round my manor beware, beware
Cause I'm bound to be around there somewhere, somewhere
The shoots loose, and so is troops dudes
With screws loose that'll do anything for the loot
Like get a bigger man moved, Or pull the trigger round you thinking"

A car window gets smashed and this man gets bashed
For acting flash, the man are on him like a rash, for the cash
Out to take every ting but his gash, when the match goes off and his leg makes blood splash
On the dashboard, that's raw, they left him with a smashed jaw
On top of braking up his ride and popping guy, crash course
Dummy's what he's left like, shadow on his left eye
All because he flexed like, he could fuck with next guys
Vexed guys that hex guys if they disrespect guys
If you ever want a man browned bred, check guys, set alight
Burn chichy man, get right, get right
Like when a crew get their set tight
These fucking bubbles should've known that trouble get's hype
On the double, there's a struggle then you get life, get life
If you're lucky then the buckey don't take life, take life
Make you just another dead Trife

Time to splert, desert the crime scene
One's got the man's wallet the other is time piece
But the white geez, the one with the piece
He almost left it on the street to get found by police
He's slipping blud, he just left a guy dripping blood
It's lucky that he had his mitts and gloves else trust they'll get him on his prints
And well you know what then, good job he thought to think
Before he acted, backed it mact it
Revel out and jacked it, smacked it, smashed it
Left the guy's ride looking like someone crashed it
Show the mother fucker what'll happen if you flash it
Cause these streets are infested with rude bois, rude bois
The type to run around and kill boys and do boys
Straight up, cut the fuck up, and shoot boys
Tryna act like they're true boys
