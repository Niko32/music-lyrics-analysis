Playing Mortal Kombat on the Mega Drive
I patched my lust with Nicorette
Went surfing down the Internet

But still I need you here tonight
Let's make love by satellite
By high speed uplink, error free
Be my Virtual Valerie

You were always something physical
Something violent and visceral
I will specify you line by line
Make a virtual girl to your design

I miss you more than I can bear
But loneliness won't take me there
By high speed uplink, error free
Be my Virtual Valerie

Let me hold on to this memory
Because I need you here with me
Be my Virtual ValerieYou might also like
