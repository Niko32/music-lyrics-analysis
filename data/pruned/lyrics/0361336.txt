[Intro: Bray]
Keep going, keep grinding ...
Till you hit the top
Uhhhhhhhhhhh
Get'Em Right Bray

[Hook: Bray]
It don't happen over night, I can't sit on my a** all day
I gotta get my hustle right, I gotta go get paid
I gotta hustle, I gotta grind
I gotta work, I gotta shine
Success all on my mind, I gotta go and put in time
Keep Going, Keep Going, Keep Going, Keep Going ... Don't Stop
Keep Going, Keep Going, Keep Going, Keep Going ... Don't Stop
Keep Grinding till I hit the top
Keep Going, Keep Going, Keep Going, Keep Going ... Don't Stop


[Verse 1: Bray]
If you keep going, then I know it's gone happen
I ball for real, but for fun, I get to rappin'
This don’t happen ... over night you gotta put in work
Think of the positive, cause think, this s*** could be worst
I'll ride for my brothers, even in the same hurse
If I’m placing in something, then you know I'm always gone be first
And everything I do, I’m the best, no rehearse
Y’all n***** scrubs, I ain't talking, no doctor or nurse
I’ve done so much s***, but I never get my credit for it
Thoughts of success, and my dreams, these n***** can’t destroy it
Only one of me, man you can’t decoyed me
When you in these streets, death and and jealously, man you can’t avoid
Don’t brake yo poccets, buying s*** you can’t afford
Weapon on my waist, they say Bray, you so paranoid
They can’t see me, like emojis on a droid
I buy my own shit bruh, yeah i been employed
These females, they gone love you, until you broke
I can’t tell the real ones, cause I, will never, be broke
They think they better than, let me hear some more jokes
And if he talking reckless, then he gone see this gunsmoke
Flow too cold give ’em a coat, i ain’t no drug dealer
But they describing me as dope
And I still get it for the low, all i know is get dough
Make it fast count it slow, SDO and that's fam, and that's all I know
Nothin' matter, but god, the fam, and money
These n***** trying to top me, they real funny
Ben frank, man I’m in love with the hundreds
Daily check, yeah you know I’m bout to run it
Everything y’all did, man I already done it
Everything i say, man it got to be one hundred
They say they getting paid, but I know they fronting
A n**** talking crazy, then I hit the button
I grind everyday, got everything i ever wanted
I don’t play bout the fam, and that’s word to my momma
