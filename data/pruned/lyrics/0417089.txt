I've spent too long away from home
Did all the things I could have done
Gone are the days of endless thrills
I know I'm not the only one
So long, I'm goin', goin' home

[Verse 2]
I saw the streets all ripe with jewels
Balconies and the laundry lines
They tried to make me welcome there
But their streets did not feel like mine
So long, I'm goin', goin' home

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I want the sun to hit my face
Through oak trees in the open lot
Forget about the things you want
Be thankful for what all you got
So long, I'm goin', goin' home
So long, I'm goin', goin' homeYou might also like
