I've never been to Paris
In the spring or the fall
I've never been to India
See the Taj Mahal, oh, no, no

I've never been to Switzerland, no, no
See the winter games played
But, ooh, I've never been to New Orleans on
Carnival or Mardi Gras day, yeah

Never been to London
On a foggy day
Ooh, I've never been
To hear a gondolier play

If I can only make it to Heaven
That will be good enough for me
Because Heaven is a place
Where I want to be, mm-hm, mm-mm

I've never been to Paris
In the spring or the fall
I've never been to India
See the Taj Mahal
You might also likeI've never been to Switzerland, no, no, no

Ooh, I've never been to New Orleans on
Carnival or Mardi Gras day, yeah

I've never been to London
On a foggy day
And, ooh, I've never been
To hear a gondolier play, no, no

All I want to do is make it to Heaven
That will be good enough for me
Because a-Heaven is a place
Where I got to be, Lord, Lord, oh, yeah, yeah, I'm talkin' about

Heaven, where the streets are made of gold
Heaven, where a saint can soothe his weary soul
Heaven, I sit down in the crystal seat
Heaven, yeah, ooh
That will, that will, that will, ah
That will, that will, that will, listen the Lord talkin'
Said, "Rance, I've seen you struggle a long, long time
But I see here by your record, you've been doing just fine
I see where you fought the devil on the ivory hill"
Said, "Listen here, man, you're what I call a good Christian man"
Hey, that will be good enough for me, yeah
That will be good enough for me, ooh-ooh
