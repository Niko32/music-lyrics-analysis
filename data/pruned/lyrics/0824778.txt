Darkened day
Torturous ways
Live only to die
Slaughterday

[Verse 2]
Cast into flames
Stoned to death
Law of the lords
Uncontrollable hoard

[Bridge]
Headless bodies on the ground
War machine leaves no life behind
Blood soaks deep into the earth
Sadistic race
Rip out your heart

[Verse 3]
Strung up
Cannibals eat your flesh
Cooked
Survival of the fittest

[Guitar Solo]
You might also like[Outro]
Peel your flesh from the bone
Souless body left alone
