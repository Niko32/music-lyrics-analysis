Were too big to fail.. felt fast like sonic head spinning tails tail
Time is like a snail , love is like a sail...
Walk with me forever baby Follow my trail...

Please don't make bail.. Your locked in my heart 

They tried to push you around Like you shopping kart

I will never break your heart, lets never be apart.. ride to the finish that's the reason why we start. ..

Shes my heartbeat you can hear the sound... always bring me up, when my feelings drown

My one and only queen no other crown... Shes my heartbeat you can hear the sound

They want to see you frown.. But I will bring your smile back..

Always knew a while back You was the train to my track..

Never make ya heart crack..

Others girls don't want that..
You might also likeThem haters going to talk that..

Ill be the best til I'm dead in the ground...

Lay your head on my chest listen to the pound...

She's my heartbeat you could hear the sound..

She's my heartbeat you could hear the sound..

Lay your head on my chest listen to the pound..

Ill be the best til I'm dead in the ground..

Your my heartbeat you can hear the sound...

I'm your Adam - she my eve... the apple to my tree...

L.e.a.f baby please don't leave
I fall - I fell... feeling like September...

You remember the plan, To always hold your hand...

Ill always stay that man never slack Do all that I can, put My feelings on this track like ran
Damn... Only yours I am like Sam, Lets always stick together no Pam in the pan
Love ocean spray they trying to bury us like cran..
Hiding how I feel.. ya see jelly - when am jam
Hope our love is sealed safe , But I have to be brave
I'm your Man like bat and I'm lost without my cave
I Dot Promise... Word to polka ill be honest

If we separated... I pray Cupid will find us
You plus me will be straight like minus

Subtract all the haters will be straight like minus
