'Til I hit the downtown
Yeah, people come walking all around
Talking 'bout a hip town
I step up to the street
I step in time
With the limousine
Ship, ship, shimmy the bell in my pocket

(chorus):
But damn, I can't get over
I just can't make a move
Damn, I just can't get over
I've got too much to lose on my mind
Tell me now

Speak high crown
Don't get down
Don't let them put you in the ground
Don't let 'em
People come walking all around
Step up to the street
Step in time
With the limousine
Ship, ship, shimmy the bell in my pocket
You might also like(chorus)
I used to live uptown
'Til I hit the downtown
Yeah, people come walking all around
Talking 'bout a hip town
I step up to the street
I step in time
With the limousine
Ship, ship, shimmy the bell in my pocket

But damn, I can't get over
I just can't make a move
Damn, I just can't get over
I just can't make a move
Damn, I just can't get over
I just can't make a move
Damn, I just can't get over
I've got too much to lose on my mind
Got too much to lose on my mind
Got too much to lose on my mind
Yeah I got too much to lose, yeah I do, yeah I do
