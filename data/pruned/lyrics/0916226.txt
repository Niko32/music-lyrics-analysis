Of the mind
On this quest for holiness
Day by day
In my head
This quest for unholiness
Into the viscous circle
Remember that you can go
Our souls shall prevail
Ages and ages ago
I am the messiah
So die
So die
Die!!!
My body contains the secrets
The secrets of inner evil denied
Dying of fear
Ancient! voices
Slow!
They shall burn!
