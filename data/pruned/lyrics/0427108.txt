There's an old hardwood tree
Staring through the glass at me
It's been there since '85
Sometimes I think it reads my mind, I guess it's true
You can't keep it from shining through

[Chorus]
There's no denying, I've been hiding
From this thing that's chasing me
Yeah, I've been running, no good it's showing
All these scars from yesterday
There comes a time you got to give it up
Spin that wheel and try your luck
You never know what you will find
It might be love this time

[Verse 2]
I knew it from that very first smile
I could taste it like a hungry child
Not at all like all the risk
You know they say that last is best

[Bridge]
Like a rainbow on a cloudy day
Just to shelter, takes my breathe away
You might also like[Chorus]
And there's no denying, I've been hiding
From this thing that's chasing me
Yeah, I've been running, no good it's showing
All these scars from yesterday
There comes a time you got to give it up
Spin that wheel and try your luck
You never know what you will find
It might be love this time
There's no denying, I've been hiding
From this thing that's chasing me
Yeah, I've been running, no good it's showing
All these scars from yesterday
There comes a time you got to give it up
Spin that wheel and try your luck
You never know what you will find
It might be love this time

[Outro]
This time, this time
Oh, this time, this time, this time
