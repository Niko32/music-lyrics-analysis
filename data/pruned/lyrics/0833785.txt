And I've heard a thousand times before that trouble only knocks at your front door
Yes we walk into town; people stop and start to stare
Well I don't mind cause your by my side, we will walk until you fall

And I've seen streets divided, and I can't find my way
And we'll walk, until the day that you decide to go, go away

Never take the time to tell
I've known you more than well
Everyday we will keep walking down the same street
Well I don't know how far we've come

And I've seen streets divided, and I can't find my way
And we'll walk, until the day that you decide to go, go away

And I've seen many times before that I was running down the wrong side of the road
And I've heard a thousand times before that I was knocking on your front door

And I've seen streets divided, and I can't find my way
And we'll walk, until the day that you decide to go
Go away, go away, go away, go away, go away, go away!You might also like
