Girl, can't you see that (I want you back)
And I'd do anything to be with you again
(I want you back)
See, I messed up (Just once)
I know I hurt you (I want you back)
Baby, I'm sorry, can't you see (I want you back)

[Verse: Teedra Moses & Raphael Saadiq]
I remember how I used to make you breakfast
In the morning before you went to work
I remember how I used to give you nookie
For your late night dessert
But I can't tell you
All the ways or
The exact date that we...fell apart
Check it out now
Now mama, I ain't trying to justify the way I broke your heart
I'm just trying to make you understand what's right here in my heart
I must have been so blind
See, I thought love was blind
But now I realize, I swear I realize
I want you back

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq & Teedra Moses]
Girl, can't you see that (I want you back)
And I'd do anything to be with you again
(I want you back)
See, I messed up (Just once)
I know I hurt you (I want you back)
Baby, I'm sorry, can't you see (I want you back)

Get on down, come on now
Get on down, come on now
Get on down, come on now

Someone help me find my baby girl
Someone help me find my baby girl
(Someone help me find...)

[Chorus: Raphael Saadiq & Teedra Moses]
Girl, can't you see that (I want you back)
And I'd do anything to be with you again
(I want you back)
See, I messed up (Just once)
I know I hurt you (I want you back)
Baby, I'm sorry, can't you see (I want you back)
Girl, can't you see that (I want you back)
And I'd do anything to be with you again
(I want you back)
See, I messed up (Just once)
I know I hurt you (I want you back)
Baby, I'm sorry, can't you see (I want you back)
