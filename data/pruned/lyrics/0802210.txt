Went and got involved
Now you're trapped and helpless
Problems you can't solve

One side and the other
There's no shelter in a crossfire

Had to play with big boys
Grew up much too fast
They ran and left you facing
Things you can't resist

Better keep your head down
Finally had your showdown, crossfire

You and I, friends long gone
Lies on lies, on and on and on

You and I, bridges burn
Lies on lies

Who's gonna rescue you ?
Tell me, who's gonna ?

Who's gonna wear the bleeding heart, put it on the line
When you gonna pay attention, sentence fits the crime
Can't hold out much longer
Shots are coming closer, crossfire
You might also likeAnd it's one side and the other
There's no shelter in a crossfire

Oh it's one side and the other
There's no shelter

Crossfire, crossfire, crossfire
Crossfire, crossfire
Crossfire, crossfire

Crossfire
