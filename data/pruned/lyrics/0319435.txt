You got to move[x2]
You got to move... ch-ch-ch-child
You got to move

[Verse]
Oh... when the Lord gets ready
You gotta move
You may be high
You may be low
You may be rich... child
You may be poor
But when the Lord gets ready
You gotta move

[Bridge]
You see that woman... who walks the street
You see that police... upon his beat
But then the Lord gets ready
