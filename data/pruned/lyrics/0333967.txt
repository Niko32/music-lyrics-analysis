And I'm so tired
I ain't had a wink of sleep seems like all week
And we're so tired
The baby's only feeding and one of them is teething
They're so tired
They get up before the dawn, I don't know how we carry on
We're so tired

Thank God their mama is a natural
She knows exactly what to do
And as for me, I think I'd go insane
I just wouldn't have a clue

You know we tryin' to do our best, but we just don't get no rest
We're so tired
Would do it all again, you can bet your life, my friend
But I'm so tired
We're so tired, so tired
So tired, so tired

Just can't wait 'til the sun goes down
And all the kids have gone to bed
Trying to sleep, you know, but sleep won't come
With all the stuff going through my head

And I'm so tired
And now mama's getting snappy, daddy won't change no nappy
And I'm so tired
We're so tired, so tired
So tired, so tired

Sometimes I think I'll just go on to bed
I must have better things to do
When it's time to get my goodnight kiss
My dreams have all come true

So tired, so tired
So tired, so tired
