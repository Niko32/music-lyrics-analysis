I'm ready when you are
Please don't make it complicated
Breaking up is overrated
Let's just figure it out
Figure it out
Don't want to talk about it
I just wanna know it's all forgiven
I forgive you
Say you'll forgive me too

[Hook]
I want you, and I want you, and I don't want you to want no one else
I want you, and I want you, and I want you to want nobody else
If only your heart and your mind could meet at the same place at the same time
Marvelous
If only we could be in the same place at the same time on the same day
Marvelous
If only
If only

[Verse 2]
I'm going through what you are
Besides my imagination
Thinking you could love me so hard
Let's just figure it out
Figure it out
Don't want to talk about it
I just wanna know you wanna give me
What I give you
Show me you miss me too

If only your heart and your mind could meet at the same place at the same time
Marvelous
If only we could be in the same place at the same time on the same day
Marvelous

If only

If only your heart and your mind could meet at the same place at the same time
Marvelous
If only we could be in the same place at the same time on the same day
Marvelous
