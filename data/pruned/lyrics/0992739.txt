Mowing Cotton, plowing Corn with folks I love so well
And Amy Brown waits for me there in Sugar Creek Bottom
But I'm here locked up in this prison cell
We were poor but we were thankful for our bottom land
All of us worked hard and i was proud as any man
And I could hardly wait for harvest time to roll around
'Cause when we sold the Cotton I would marry Amy Brown
Amy lived across the creek about 2 miles away
And in the fields beneath the sun she worked hard every day
It broke my heart to see her pretty hands all bruised and sore
I promised when we married, she would work the fields no more
I'd like to be back on the farm in Sugar Creek Bottom
But I'm here locked up in this prison cell
Big Sam Mclure stood 6 foor eight and weighed 300 lbs
The word was out that he had said, "He'd get Amy Brown,"
He took the things he wanted and he pushed his weight around
The meanest man that ever walked on Sugar Creek Ground
I was walking Amy home, no worries in the world
When bit Sam stepped up in the road and said, "I want this girl,"
And I reached for my pocket knife, his hand pushed me aside
I didn't mean to kill him, thought I'd cut him down to size
But even in this prison I see Amy now and then
I've served half my time, in 5 more years I'm free again
But I'll be marked a killer in the people's eyes for sure
Its a shame to make a man serve time for killing Sam Mclure
I'd like to be back on the farm in Sugar Creek Bottom
