The night's as clear as a big desert sky
But it's hard to see the stars with these tears in my eyes
Yeah, it's hard not to cry
There's twenty-six reasons why

[Verse 2]
There's broken hearts that'll never be the same
Shattered lives still reeling from the pain
Of plans and dreams now gone
Oh, how do you move on?

[Verse 3]
But I believe
There's someone who's looking after me
Someone beside me night and day
To light the way
It's hard to conceive
Something you can't see
But I believe
I believe

[Verse 4]
There's twenty-six angels looking down from above
Resting in his mercy, grace and love
Time may never heel
The sadness that we feel
You might also like[Chorus]

[Outro]
The rivers flow now that used to be dry
As people all over the world start to cry
But I believe
