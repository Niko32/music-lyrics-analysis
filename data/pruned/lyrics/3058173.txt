Oh, my man
I hope your heart
Won't pretend
You ain't that hard

[Chorus]
And, oh, I don't love you
Anymore
And, oh, I don't love you
Anymore
No, I never did

[Verse 2]
Oh, my man
I hoped your heart
Won't pretend
You ain't that far

[Chorus]
And, oh, I don't love you
Anymore, anymore

[Verse 3]
Oh, my friend
I hope you're here
Oh, pretend
You ain't that near
You might also like[Chorus]
And, oh, I don't love you
Anymore
And, oh (Oh) , I don't love you
Anymore (Oh)

[Bridge]
You and me
We fail to see
(And, oh)
Deep in my eyes
We fail to fly

[Outro]
The autopsy report read
The insides were beautiful
The autopsy report read
The insides, were beautiful
The autopsy report read
The insides, that's what's beautiful
Insides were beautiful
Insides, that's what's beautiful
We're inside, it's beautiful
