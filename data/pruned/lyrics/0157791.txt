"...i'm just saying that shit's like everywhere you know what I mean? You look on the corner, you look on TV, you look at movies...you can just see that we, as a nation, are locked...we're in a fucking rut right now. We're letting outside forces influence our decisions, that's just how we go about our business. You have somebody else tell you what's cool, what's not cool, be self consciousness, be better than what you are, be worse than what you are. You just gotta stand up on your own two, overcome that shit."- KING

Verse 1:
I been ridin' solo for so long, so call me dolo
Accept me as I are, broken art along with no dough
Destroy this petty paycheck, they should jerk me off instead
Workin' off these trends, (yo son fuck yo lens)
These hoes is with they bras off, this lighter to the molotov
Cocktails for my garbage pals, drill the small talk
Into the Rocnation, promise you won't be contemplatin'
On choosin' the fuckin' loser with his groove loose, see you whores later
Warm Coors on the pay phone, at the corner of seven eleven
And seventh heaven
I paged the gods for a lesson in hindsight
Rolling papers on the dashboard puts my mind right
Where the fuck it need be, ya'll may be restless
Rest easy get ya foot tappin' as a test yes
Response pattern positive, i'm fluent with these constant hits
Throw ya unos to you-know-who though, and get rewarded with my wit

Hook:
Plans is set in motion while you craft the reputation
Dollas to the top like a Donald Trump nation
The crew that you fuck with, the money that you stuntin'
It's shiny at first till it's rustin'. X2

I've chose my path, sold my wrath
Payed my dues in cash, fed the fools some scraps
Crapped a couple tapes out, lacking the crispy quality
Got a better mic, been busy straight accomplishing
Low cup show nuff', went a couple rounds
Couldn't help it I was on the ground
"God damn it there he go again
Lookin' like an ass with his ass out, blasted, fuckin' trash"
Smashin', dashin', we in the store we grabbin'
What the fuck we want, what the fuck we need: fantastic
I'm a bastard in the eyes of my community
You can find that usually i'm rummaging through pantries
Do the equation, ya'll L 7's
Worse than 9/11 times ten and
You repeatin' lines, on and on makin' biggie cry
Rollin' over in his grave, throw your albums in the bat cave


Hook:
Plans is set in motion while you craft the reputation
Dollas to the top like a Donald Trump nation
The crew that you fuck with, the money that you stuntin'
It's shiny at first till it's rustin'. X
