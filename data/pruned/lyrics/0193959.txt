Have you ever skipped a stone across the water
Have you ever hitched a free ride on a train
Have you ever climbed up on a water tower
To write a name

[Pre-Chorus]
The truth is, every man dies
Not every man lives

[Verse 2]
Have you ever loved someone that you would die for
Have you ever walked too far out on a limb
Have you ever chased a dream too high to reach for
And pulled it in

[Pre-Chorus]
Truth is, every man dies
And not every man lives

[Chorus]
I wanna paint outside the lines, run the red lights in my mind
Take everything one lifetime has to give
I wanna stand inside a fire, walk blindfolded on a wire
Every man dies, but not every man lives
You might also like[Verse 3]
Have you ever thought about how fast time passes
Ever thought about what you would leave behind
Ever stood up for somethin' you believed in
And drawn a line

[Pre-Chorus]
Truth is, every man dies
And not every man lives

[Chorus]
I wanna paint outside the lines, run the red lights in my mind
Take everything one lifetime has to give
I wanna stand inside a fire, walk blindfolded on a wire
Every man dies, but not every man lives

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
I wanna stand inside a fire
Walk blindfolded on a wire
Every man dies, but not every man lives

[Outro]
Have you ever skipped a stone across the water
Have you ever hitched a free ride on a train
