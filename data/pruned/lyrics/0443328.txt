I got misled, mistook, discard
Anything that I said
See, I'm not the type to call you up drunk
But I've got some lies to tell

[Verse 1]
She hates her work, but loves to flirt
It's a shame she don't work with me
She gets uptight, don't like when I'm gone
But she won't let on to me

[Chorus]
I said, "I'm only looking out for you"
She said, "It's obvious that's a lie"
"But I only ever put out for you
You know it's obvious you don't try"

[Verse 2]
I got mistook and took dissent
And it's not as if you didn't notice
But I tried to steer you clear of this place
And I wound up with nothing to show for it

"You never got that from me"
She said, "You never got that from me"
She said, "You never got that from me"
Oh, but I said, "You got that look from me"
You might also like[Chorus]
I said, "I'm only looking out for you"
She said, "It's obvious that's a lie"
"But I only ever put out for you
You know it's obvious you don't try"
I said, "I'm only looking out for you"
She said, "It's obvious that's a lie"
"But I only ever put out for you
You know it's obvious you don't try"

[Outro]
I got misled, mistook, discard
Anything that I said
See, I'm not the type to call you up drunk
But I've got some lies to tell
