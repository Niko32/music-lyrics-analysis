You're just a fallen star
Betrayed by a dream in vain

Before you're dead you must be released by the victorious one
Take your last breath and cry before I unleash hell

We have the cure for our endless war
And it's the last night before the darkness and light
Blackhearted midnight walker is going nowhere
Beneath the stars he wonders, is he hollow?

Nightfall
The darkest time arriving
Look into the mirror of madness
Drown in the chasm of sadness
Day zero never comes
Thorn in my spine awaiting salvation
For the day of redemption

Death unlimited is coming your way you got nothing to say
Hellhole is gonna tear you apart
Don't you know that everything is an end or maybe not
'cause you don't know shit

Nightfall
The darkest time arriving
Look into the mirror of madness
Drown in the chasm of sadness
Day zero never comes
Thorn in my spine awaiting salvation
For the day of redemption
