In the morning
I see the light

Afternoon I'm in the backyard
Passing the time

And when I've said good-bye to sunshine
I call on some of my friends
"see you soon, under the moonlight"

Something's moving
Outside of my house
In the night

It could be the whistle of the breeze
Or some wildlife
But we are alright

Drinking our tea
Tucked in the bed sheets
I'll dream in melody

How about you?
What will you do?
You might also likeOh maybe
Mother and father
Still see the light

And when they can't sit in the sunshine
They call on each other
"see you soon, under the moonlight"
