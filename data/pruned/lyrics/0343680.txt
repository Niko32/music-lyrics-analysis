This week or last week
I don't really care about it anymore
I write myself this later
I tell myself you let me go
Without me
Oh, what's wrong with you?

[Chorus]
Monday, Monday, Monday
Monday, Monday, Monday
Monday, Monday, Monday
Monday, Monday, Monday

[Verse 2]
Your house or mine
I don't really care about it anymore
I close my eyes
I make myself unhappy so you'll go
Without me
Oh, what's wrong with you?

[Chorus]
Monday, Monday, Monday
Monday, Monday, Monday
Monday, Monday, Monday
Monday, Monday, Monday

Oh, and I
I say damn your mood swings, damn your mood swings
Oh, and I
I say damn your mood swings, damn your mood swings

[Verse 3]
I'm calling out
I don't really care for your city anymore
I spend the night
I lay awake and miss you when you go
Without me
Oh, what's wrong with you?

[Chorus]
Monday, Monday, Monday
Monday, Monday, Monday
Monday, Monday, Monday
Monday, Monday, Monday

[Outro]
Oh, and I
I say damn your mood swings
Oh, and I
I say damn your mood swings, damn your mood swings
Oh, and I
I say damn your mood swings, damn your mood swings
Oh, and I
I say damn your mood swings, Damn your mood swings
