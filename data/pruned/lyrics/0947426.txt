Don't I wonder what you'd do
Would you look at me and say you love me too
If you only knew

If you only knew I'm dreaming of you
Every night the whole night through
Would you make my wildest dream of you come true
If you only knew

I pretend I'm just a friend
But now and then I wonder what you'd do
Would you love me too
If you only knew

I pretend I'm just a friend
Oh but now and then I wonder what you'd do
Would you love me too
If you only knew

Wonder what you'd do
Would you love me to
If you only knewYou might also like
