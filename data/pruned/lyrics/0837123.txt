The bottom line to this story
Is for the guys, who are wise
I know you've got someone special
That you'd love to get next to
And I'd just like to share this with you
Because you know me, I...
I wanna go to, like to see people together
You never know
Baby, you can't help put your situation too

[Verse 1]
When you want to impress
(somebody)
And trying to catch
(somebody)
Remember the old school
And don't forget the old rule (no!)
“Haste makes waste”
And you don't want to worry
Keep this in mind
“All things in time”

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, once she's there, next to you
And you're burning with desire
Look her right into her eyes, and tell her
“Baby, I need your fire”
The lady's got a way of knowing
If you really mean it
One thing more
You've got to make sure
You might also like[Chorus]
That it's the right night
And moonlight
(Nothing is better with love every time)
The right night
By firelight
(Nothing is better, when two are together)
The right night
And candlelight
(Nothing works better, it gets you every time)
The right night
With the starlit sky
(It just makes it better, when two are together)

Now you want her so bad
She's like no one you've had
(No one you've had)
Her love is the passion
(That's causing that reaction)
Show her tenderness
Be gentle when you do it
You won't regret it
And she won't forget

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, once she's laying in your arms
Just before you start to do it
Remember it's not about what you've got, my friend
But how you use it
The lady's got a feel for what's real, and don't you forget it
One thing more
You've got to make sure
[Chorus]
It's the right night
And moonlight
(Nothing is better with love, every time)
The right night
By the firelight
(Nothing is better, when two are together)
The right night
And candlelight
(...do it and remember, yeah!)
The right night
With the starlit sky
(Just makes it better, when two are together)
The right night
By the ocean side
(Nothing works better, it gets me every time)
The right night
And moonlight
(Nothing works better, when two are together)

[Bridge]
Well...
Nothing goes better
Nothing works better
When two are together
To the guys, who are wise, all things in time
You just got to make sure, that your time is right
The right night and moonlight
The right night and candle light
The right night sitting by firelight
Remember guys
The lady knows
Oh yes... they know

[Chorus]
You've got to make sure
It's the right night
And moonlight
(Nothing is better with love, every time)
The right night
With candlelight
(Nothing works better, when two are together)
