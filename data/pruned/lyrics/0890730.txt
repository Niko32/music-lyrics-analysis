And take You into the center of my soul
I wanna run through
The fields of your imagination

Under the blue skies, You're the golden sun
The light in my eyes, I know You are the One
See where my heart lies
As you guide me through the shades of gray

Along the way
I will hang on every single word You say
And never live to see my dying day
I'd walk the aisle a million miles
To see You smile

I wanna know how it feels to believe in something
Ride on the heels of a good thing coming
Run to the one thing I know is something true
I wanna be with You

Want You to show me the wonder of the word
Want You to hear me like no one's ever heard
You have and hold me
Leading me out of the darkest night
You might also likeInto the light
And never has it ever been so right
And from this moment on You are the sight
I can't erase
I close my eyes, I see Your face

I wanna know how it feels to believe in something
Ride on the heels of a good thing coming
Run to the one thing I know is something true
I wanna be with You

Every day, every night
For the rest of my life
I wanna be where You are
'Cause You're never very far away
I always wanna be with You

I wanna tell You things I've never told
And take You into the center of my soul
I wanna run through
The fields of your imagination

I wanna know how it feels to believe in something
Ride on the heels of a good thing coming
Run to the one thing I know is something true
I wanna live my life like I hold the meaning
Deep inside my soul I hear the music screaming
Eyes wide open I'm awake and dreaming, too
I wanna be with You
