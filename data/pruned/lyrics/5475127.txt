You ask for a picture of me
You hope I can hear your sincerity
Oh, baby, I do
You sit on the edge of the bed
I wonder and wish I was in your head
Oh yes, I do

[Chorus]
'Cause when it rains it pours, pours, pours
Don't know what for, for, for
Put your head in my hands
I'll be your man
'Cause the sun's out of view

[Post-Chorus]
My baby in blue
Baby in blue
Baby in blue
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Baby in blue

[Verse 2]
All frozen and stuck in a dream
You're drowning in something that I can't see
Innocence gone (Gone, gone, gone)
Dying scares you, so scream at the sky
But then, there's the fear of being alive
Alive and all wrong (Wrong, wrong)
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause when it rains it pours, pours, pours
Don't know what for, for, for
Put your head in my hands
I'll be your man
'Cause the sun's out of view

[Post-Chorus]
My baby in blue
Baby in blue
Baby in blue
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Baby in blue
