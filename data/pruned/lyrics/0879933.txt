You wouldn't listen and I wouldn't blame you now
I ain't got money but I sure got bills to pay
I roll my cigarettes a little smaller every day

Chorus:
It's been a long hard year
That wouldn't be so bad
Darlin, if I only had you near

My kids need new shoes
But I ain't no money machine
All my overtime is gone for gasoline
On a car that's running down
Getting me to work in town
Meanwhile you're running around
My heart is wearing a frown

Chorus

I read the news in the papers everday
Hard times a comin and I guess they're here to stay
I ain't got money I've just got some bills to pay
I roll my cigarettes a little smaller everyday

Chorus
