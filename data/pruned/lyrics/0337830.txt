7 AM
The garbage truck beeps as it backs up
And I start my day thinking about what I've thrown away
Could I push rewind?
Oh, the credits traverse signifying the end
But I missed the best part, could we please go back to the start?

[Pre-Chorus]
Forgive my indecision

[Chorus]
Then again, then again
Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side
But then again, then again
Then again, a day will come when I want off that ride, babe

[Verse 2]
11 AM
By now you would think that I would be up
But my bed sheets shade the heat of choices I've made
And what did I find?
I never thought I could want someone so much
'Cause now you're not here and I'm knee deep in that old fear

[Pre-Chorus]
Forgive my indecision
I am only a man
You might also like[Chorus]
Then again, then again
Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side
But then again, then again, again, again
Then again, a day will come when I want off that ride, baby

[Bridge]
12 PM and my dusty telephone rings
Heavy head up from my pillow, who could it be?
I hope it's you
It's you

[Chorus]
Then again, then again
Then again, you're always first when no one's on your side
But then again, then again, again, again
Then again, the day has come and I want off that ride, babe
