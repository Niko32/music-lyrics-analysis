Please don't see just a boy caught up in dreams and fantasies
Please see me reachin' out for someone I can't see

[Pre-Chorus]
Take my hand, let's see where we wake up tomorrow
Best laid plans sometimes are just a one night stand
I'll be damned, Cupid's demandin' back his arrow
So let's get drunk on our tears and

[Chorus]
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's huntin' season and the lambs are on the run
Searchin' for meanin', but are we all lost stars
Tryin' to light up the dark?

[Verse 2]
Who are we?
Just a speck of dust within the galaxy
Woe is me if we're not careful turns into reality

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't you dare let our best memories bring you sorrow
Yesterday, I saw a lion kiss a deer
Turn the page, maybe we'll find a brand new ending
Where we're dancing in our tears and
You might also like[Chorus]
God, tell us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's huntin' season and the lambs are on the run
Searchin' for meanin', but are we all lost stars
Tryin' to light up the dark?

[Bridge]
And I thought I saw you out there cryin', ooh
And I thought I heard you call my name, yeah, yeah
And I thought I heard you out there cryin', oh!
Just the same, oh, yeah

[Chorus]
God, give us the reason youth is wasted on the young
It's huntin' season and this lamb is on the run
Searchin' for meanin', but are we all lost stars? (Oh yeah)
Tryin' to light, light up the dark

[Bridge]
And I thought I saw you out there crying, ooh oh
And I thought I heard you call my name, ooh
And I thought I heard you out there crying, oh

[Outro]
But are we all lost stars, tryin' to light up the dark?
But are we all lost stars, tryin' to light up the dark?
