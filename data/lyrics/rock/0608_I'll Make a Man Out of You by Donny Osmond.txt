Let's get down to business to defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters when I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you
Tranquil as a forest, but on fire within
Once you find your center, you are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow, I'll make a man out of you

[CHIEN PO]
I'm never gonna catch my breath

[YAO]
Say goodbye to those who knew me

[LING]
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym

[MUSHU]
This guy's got 'em scared to death

[MULAN]
Hope he doesn't see right through me

Now I really wish that I knew how to swim!

[SHANG, Chorus]
(Be a man) We must be swift as a coursing river
(Be a man) With all the force of a great typhoon
(Be a man) With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon

[SHANG]
Time is racing toward us 'til the Huns arrive
Heed my every order, and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home; you're through
How could I make a man out of you?

[SHANG, Chorus]
(Be a man) We must be swift as a coursing river
(Be a man) With all the force of a great typhoon
(Be a man) With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon
(Be a man) We must be swift as a coursing river
(Be a man) With all the force of a great typhoon
(Be a man) With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon
