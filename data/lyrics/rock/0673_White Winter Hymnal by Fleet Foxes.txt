I was following the, I was following the
I was following the, I was following the
I was following the, I was following the
I was following the, I was following the

[Chorus]
I was following the pack, all swaddled in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow
Red as strawberries in the summertime

[Chorus]
I was following the pack, all swaddled in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow
Red as strawberries in the summertime

[Chorus]
I was following the pack, all swaddled in their coats
With scarves of red tied 'round their throats
To keep their little heads from fallin' in the snow
And I turned 'round and there you go
And, Michael, you would fall and turn the white snow
Red as strawberries in the summertimeYou might also like
