Oh, can you tell me, can you tell me the way the story ends?
A monster in my heart
A ghost inside my chest
I'm broken down, the world around us
Surrounds my suffering
You smile and laugh at me
But you don't see a thing

[Verse 1]
Damaged and broken as I am
I'm trying not to breathe
Unraveled, I'm not unraveled by
The truth I finally see, freeze

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm breakable, unbreakable
I'm shakeable, unshakeable
Unraveling since I found you

[Chorus]
And now I'm turning to dust in a world that's twisted
Don't come searching when I go missing
Close your eyes or just try to look away
Don't want to hurt you
We live in a world someone else imagined
The ghost of what's left of me all but vanished
Remember my heart, how bright I used to shine
You might also like[Verse 2]
Entangled in the loneliness
The memory of innocence
It's stinging me, it's breaking me
The pain is spreading endlessly
I cannot move, I close my eyes
I try to breathe, I realize
I'm paralyzed, I'm paralyzed
Unravel the world!

[Verse 3]
I'm not what I was then
Don't touch the infection
Entwined we will both die
So stay away, and stay alive

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm breakable, unbreakable
I'm shakeable, unshakeable
Unraveling, I won't infect you!

[Chorus]
Now I'm turning to dust in a world that's twisted
Don't come searching when I go missing
Close your eyes or just try to look away
Don't want to hurt you
We live in a world someone else imagined
The ghost of what's left of me all but vanished
Remember my heart, how bright I used to shine
[Bridge]
Please, just don't forget me
Don't forget me
Don't forget me
Don't forget me
Don't forget me!

[Chorus]
We live in a world someone else imagined
The ghost of what's left of me all but vanished
Remember my heart, how bright I used to shine

[Outro]
Oh, can you tell me?
Oh, can you tell me?
A monster in my heart
And now there's nothing left
