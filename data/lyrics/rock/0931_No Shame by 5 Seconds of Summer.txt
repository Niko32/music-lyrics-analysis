Angel, with the gun in your hand
Pointin' my direction, givin' me affection
Love is fatal, won't you give it a chance?
Center of attention, don't you ask me any questions

[Pre-Chorus: Luke, Luke & Ashton]
Go on and light me like a cigarette
Even if it might be somethin' you regret
You got me now, now, now
Swallow me down, down, down, down

[Chorus: All]
I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Never enough and no satisfaction
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Changin' my face and callin' it fashion
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name

[Verse 2: Luke]
Lay me in the palm of your hand
I'll give you my permission, you'll always be forgiven
Go on, replace me
When you're cravin' somethin' sweeter than the words I left in your mouth
Go on and spit me out
You might also like[Chorus: All]
I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Never enough and no satisfaction
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Changin' my face and callin' it fashion
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name

[Post-Chorus: All, Luke]
I love the way you're screaming my name
I love the way you're screaming my name
[Bridge: Luke, Luke & Ashton]
Go on and light me like a cigarette
Even if it might be somethin' you regret
You got me now, now, now
Swallow me down, down, down, down

[Chorus: All]
I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Never enough and no satisfaction
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Changin' my face and callin' it fashion
Got no shame
I love the way you're screaming my name
[Post-Chorus: All, Luke]
I love the way you're screaming my name
I love the way you're screaming my name
