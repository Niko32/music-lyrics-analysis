When I'm feeling lonely
Sad as I can be
All by myself, an uncharted island
In an endless sea

[Verse 2]
What makes me happy
Fills me up with glee
Those bones in my jaw!
Don't have a flaw
My shiny teeth and me

[Hook]
My shiny teeth that twinkle
Just like the stars in space
My shiny teeth that sparkle
Adding beauty to my face
My shiny teeth that glisten
Just like a Christmas tree
You know they'd walk a mile
Just to see me smile (Woo!)
My shiny teeth and me
(Shiny teeth, shiny teeth)

[Verse 3]
Yes, they're all so perfect
So white and pearly
Brush, gargle, rinse
A couple breath mints
My shiny teeth and me
You might also like[Hook]
My shiny teeth, so awesome
Just like your favorite song
My shiny teeth, I floss them
So they'll grow to be real strong
My shiny teeth, I love them
And they all love me
Why should I talk to you
When I've got 32 (Woo!)
Shiny teeth and me
(Shiny teeth, shiny teeth)

[Instrumental]

[Hook]
My shiny teeth that twinkle
Just like the stars in space
My shiny teeth that sparkle
Adding beauty to my face
My shiny teeth that glisten
Just like a Christmas tree
You know they'd walk a mile
Just to see me smile (Woo!)
My shiny teeth and me
(Shiny teeth, shiny teeth)
[Outro]
My shiny teeth and me
(Shiny teeth, shiny teeth)
My shiny teeth and me
(Shiny teeth, shiny teeth)
My shiny teeth and me
(Shiny teeth, shiny teeth)
