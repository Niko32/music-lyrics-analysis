I saw you lookin' brand new overnight
I caught you lookin' too, but you didn't look twice
You look happy, oh, mmm
You look happy, oh

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Flashing back to New York City
Changing flights so you stay with me
Remember thinkin' that I got this right

[Chorus: Luke & Calum, Luke]
And now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleanin' up your mess
I know he's takin' off your dress
And I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me
Hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me

[Verse 2: Luke, All, Luke & Calum]
It's 3AM and the moonlight's testin' me (Ooh, ah-ah)
If I can make it till dawn, then it won't be hard to see (Ooh, ah-ah)
That I ain't happy, oh, mmm
I ain't too happy, oh, mmm

[Pre-Chorus: Luke & Calum]
Flashing back to New York City
Changing flights so you stay with me
Problem was I thought I had this right
You might also like[Chorus: All, Luke]
Now I wish we never met
'Cause you're too hard to forget
While I'm cleanin' up your mess
I know he's takin' off your dress
And I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me

[Outro: All, Luke]
Singing, lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie
Li-li-lie, lie, lie, lie
And I know that you don't, but if I ask you if you love me
I hope you lie, lie, lie, lie, lie to me
