Punctured bicycle on a hillside desolate
Will nature make a man of me yet?
When in this charming car, this charming man
Why pamper life's complexity
When the leather runs smooth on the passenger seat?
I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"

[Chorus]
Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things

[Verse 2]
I would go out tonight but I haven't got a stitch to wear
This man said, "It's gruesome that someone so handsome should care"

[Bridge]
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na
This charming man
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na
This charming man
You might also like[Chorus]
Ah, a jumped-up pantry boy
Who never knew his place
He said, "Return the ring"
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
He knows so much about these things
