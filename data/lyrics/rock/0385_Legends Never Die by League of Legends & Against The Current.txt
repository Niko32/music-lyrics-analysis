Legends never die
When the world is callin' you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Relentless you survive

[Verse 1]
They never lose hope
When everything's cold and the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones
They'll run into smoke when the fire is fierce

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

[Chorus]
Legends never die
When the world is calling you
Can you hear them screamin' out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs
The scars collected all of their lives

[Verse 2]
When everything's lost
They pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts
They suffer through harm just to touch a dream

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, pick yourself up 'cause

[Chorus]
Legends never die
When the world is calling you
Can you hear them screamin' out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die

[Bridge]
When the world is callin' out your name
Begging you to fight
[Pre-Chorus]
Pick yourself up once more
Pick yourself up 'cause

[Chorus]
Legends never die
When the world is calling you
Can you hear them screamin' out your name?
Legends never die
They become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness
Legends never die

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
