Immortal temptation
Takes over my mind
Condemned
Falling weak on my knees
Summon the strength
Of mayhem

[Chorus 1]
I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking
Black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames
I have been blessed
My family crest is a demon of death!
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ash in dark divine
Descending misery
Destiny chasing time

[Verse 2]
Inherit the nightmare
Surrounded by fate
Can’t run away
Keep walking the line
Between the light
Led astray
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Through vacant halls I won’t surrendеr
The truth revealеd in eyes of ember
We fight through fire and ice forever
Two souls once lost, and now they remember

[Chorus 2]
I am the storm that is approaching
Provoking
Black clouds in isolation
I am reclaimer of my name
Born in flames
I have been blessed
My family crest is a demon of death!
Forsakened, I am awakened
A phoenix's ash in dark divine
Descending misery
Destiny chasing time
Disappear into the night
Lost shadows left behind
Obsession's pulling me
Fading, I've come to take what's mine!

[Bridge]
Lurking in the shadows under veil of night
Constellations of blood pirouette
Dancing through the graves of those who stand at my feet
Dreams of the black throne I keep on repeat
A derelict of dark, summoned from the ashes
The puppetmaster congregates all the masses
Pulling strings, twisting minds as blades hit
You want this power? Then come try and take it
[Breakdown]
Beyond the tree
Fire burns
Secret love
Bloodline yearns
Dark minds embrace
Crimson joy
Does your dim heart
Heal or destroy?
[Instrumental breakdown]

[Chorus 3]
Bury the light deep within!
Cast aside, there's no coming home!
We're burning chaos in the wind!
Drifting in the ocean all alone!
