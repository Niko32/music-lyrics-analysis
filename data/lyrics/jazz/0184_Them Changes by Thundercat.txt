Nobody move, there's blood on the floor
And I can't find my heart
Where did it go? Did I leave it in the cold?
So please give it back, 'cause it's not yours to take
It must've fell when I lost my mind
Deep in the cut, drowning it in pain
Somebody help 'cause I can't find my way
Nobody move, nobody move

[Interlude]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ahh-ahh

[Verse 2]
Somebody tell me how I'm supposed to feel
When I'm sitting here knowing this ain't real (Ain't real)
Why in the world would I give my heart to you?
Just to watch you throw it in the trash
I've been traveling so long, I don't think I can hold on
Where were you when I needed you the most?
Now I'm sitting here with a black hole in my chest
A heartless, broken mess
