I'll be your baby
There’s nothing better I'd rather do
I'm lost completely
I might as well be over the moon

[Verse 1]
I’d like it if you tried
Before you change my mind
Are you gonna be here with me?
I know you better

This momentary ride
This f‌ire by my side
Are you gonna be here with me?
You know that...

[Chorus]
I'll be your baby
There's nothing better I'd rather do
I'm lost completely
I might as well be over the moon

[Verse 2]
You call me up at night
Imaginary lines
Are you gonna go back to sleep?
I know you better
You might also likeThan you know yourself
I'm only saying
Play your hand with someone else (Someone else)
Don't tell me how to...

[Chorus]
Be your baby
There's nothing better I’d rather do
I’m lost completely
I might as well be over the moon
I might as well be over the moon

[Outro]
Tell me, baby
Tell me, baby...
