Well, sometimes, I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head, I paint a picture

[Pre-Chorus]
Since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool out of me

[Chorus]
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie, yeah
Valerie
Valerie

[Verse 2]
Did you have to go to jail?
Put your house on up for sale?
Did you get a good lawyer?
I hope you didn't catch a tan
I hope you'll find the right man
Who'll fix it for you
And are you shoppin' anywhere?
Changed the colour of your hair?
And are you busy?
And did you have to pay that fine
That you were dodgin' all the time?
Are you still dizzy?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool out of me

[Chorus]
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie
Valerie
Valerie

[Verse 3]
Well, sometimes, I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things, what you're doin'
And in my head, I paint a picture

[Pre-Chorus]
Since I've come on home
Well, my body's been a mess
And I've missed your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over?
Stop makin' a fool out of me
[Chorus]
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
Valerie, yeah
Valerie
Valerie, yeah
Oh, Valerie
Oh, Valerie
Oh, Valerie, yeah, Valerie, yeah
Valerie

[Outro]
Why don't you come on over, Valerie?
