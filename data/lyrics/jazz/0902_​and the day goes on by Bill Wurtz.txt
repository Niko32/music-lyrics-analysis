Woke up in the morning
Traveling straight into the sun
Told my friends and family I was gone
Looked back in the mirror
Thought about who I had become
And, I don't think that anything's gone wrong

[Verse 2]
Jumped out of my suitcase
And went traveling down the road
Went back to the place where I was born
Thinking about my future
Thinkin' 'bout how far we have come
Oh, I don't think I'm gonna be going home

[Chorus]
And the day goes on, goes on, goes on, goes on
And the day goes on
And the day goes on, goes on, goes on, hold on
And the day goes on

[Verse 3]
Went down to Virginia
Thinkin' 'bout how to change my name
Just in case I have to fly away
Jumped onto a spaceship
Then I went to outer space
And, now I think I'm gonna be okay
You might also like[Chorus]
And the day goes on, goes on, goes on, goes on
And the day goes on
And the day goes on, goes on
Hold on
When'st the day goes (on)

[Bridge]
And I'm long gone
And I'm long gone
And I'm right where I belong
[Verse 4]
I went to the future
Thinkin' 'bout how to spend my day
Thinkin' 'bout the things I can't explain
It's 1900 and the times are going to change
Oh, now I think we're gonna be okay
[Chorus]
And the day goes on, goes on, goes on, goes on
And it goes along
And the day goes on, hold on, hold on, stay strong
And the day goes on
