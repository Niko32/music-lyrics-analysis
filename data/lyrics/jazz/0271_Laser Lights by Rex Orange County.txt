I might eat breakfast here before I move on
Laser lights all around me when I get the chance
To get my groove on
Dancing by myself, I still take my shoes off
And ignore it 'til I feel alright
And I might get restless if I stay for too long
I would up and leave this fuckin' bullshit
If it meant that I could see her
Dancing to the shit that sounds nothing like me, huh?
Dancing to the shit I like

[Verse 2]
But now I'm losing my speed
Because I'm not the type of person who can handle defeat
And I'll be caught up and confused about what matters to me

But I don't like it anymore, nah

[Verse 3]
Palm to the face, when we have to speak I usually shoegaze
And if I saw you in public, I would pretend to tie my shoelace
Just so we avoid the, "What's up-up-up?"
You'll never love me like they do, you'll never love me like she does
You, I could never commit to, I'm too fond of my own freedom
I know you're all about the checks, but boy, I don't need 'em
I think I'll get that myself
Thank you anyway (Ah)
