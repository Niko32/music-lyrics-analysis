You have to understand the way I am, mein herr
A tiger is a tiger, not a lamb, mein herr
You'll never turn the vinegar to jam, mein herr
So I do what I do when I'm through, then I'm through
And I'm through, toodle-doo!

[Chorus]
Bye, bye, mein lieber herr
Farewell, mein lieber herr
It was a fine affair, but now it's over
And though I used to care, I need the open air
You're better off without me, mein herr

Don't dab your eye, mein herr
Or wonder why, mein herr
I've always said that I was a rover
You mustn't knit your brow
You should have known by now
You'd every cause to doubt me, mein herr

[Verse 2]
The continent of Europe is so wide, mein herr
Not only up and down, but side to side, mein herr
I couldn't ever cross it if I tried, mein herr
But I do what I can
Inch by inch, step by step
Mile by mile, man by man
You might also like[Chorus]
Bye, bye, mein lieber herr
Farewell, mein lieber herr
It was a fine affair, but now it's over
And though I used to care, I need the open air
You're better off without me, mein herr

Don't dab your eye, mein herr
Or wonder why, mein herr
I've always said that I was a rover
You mustn't knit your brow
You should have known by now
You'd every cause to doubt me, mein herr

[German Chorus]
Bye, bye, mein lieber herr
Auf wiedersehen, mein herr
Es war sehr gut, mein herr, und vorbei
Du kennst mich wohl, mein herr
Ach, lebe wohl, mein herr
Du sollst mich nie mehr sehen, mein herr

Bye, bye, mein lieber herr
(Auf wiedersehen
Es war sehr gut)
Und vorbei
Du kennst mich wohl, mein herr
(Du kennst mich wohl
Ach, lebe wohl
Du sollst mich nie mehr)
And bye, bye
[Chorus]
Bye, bye, mein lieber herr
Farewell, mein lieber herr
It was a fine affair, but now it's over
And though I used to care, I need the open air
You're better off without me
You'll get on without me

(Auf wiedersehen
Es war sehr gut
Du kennst mich wohl
Ach, lebe wohl
Du sollst mich nie mehr...
Auf wiedersehen
Bye, bye, mein herr...)

Mein herr!
