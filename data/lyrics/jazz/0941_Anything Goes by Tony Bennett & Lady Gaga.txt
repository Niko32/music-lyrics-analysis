In olden days, a glimpse of stocking
Was looked on as something shocking
Now heaven knows
Anything goes

[Verse 2: Tony Bennett]
Good authors too who once knew better words
Now only use four letter words
Writing prose
Anything goes

[Chorus 1: Tony Bennett, Lady Gaga, both]
The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today, and day's night today
And black's white today
When most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos
And though I'm not a great romancer
I know that you're bound to answer
When we propose
Anything goes
Go!
Go!

[Chorus 2: Tony Bennett, Lady Gaga, both]
The world has gone mad today
And good's bad today, and day's night today
And black's white today
And most guys today that women prize today
Are just silly gigolos
And though we're not such great romancers
We know that you're bound to answer
When we propose
Anything goes
Anything goes
Anything goes
