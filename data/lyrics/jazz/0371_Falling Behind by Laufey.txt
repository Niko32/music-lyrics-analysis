Moved out to a new city
June is dawning down on me
And all that I can find's

A sickly romance in the air
Lovers stroll without a care in sight
Oh this can’t be right

[Chorus]
'Cause the sun's engaged to the sky
And my best friends found a new guy
I’m only getting older
I've never had a shoulder to cry on
Someone to call mine
Everybody's falling in love
And I'm falling behind

[Verse 2]
Touched the ocean fell right in
Stepped outside and burned my skin
My life won't go my way
Bossa nova in my room
Hoped that I'll find someone too
To love, bеcause
You might also like[Chorus]
The sun's engagеd to the sky
And my best friends found a new guy
I'm only getting older
I’ve never had a shoulder to cry on
Someone to call mine
Everybody’s falling in love
And I'm falling behind

[Post-Chorus]
Everybody’s falling in love
Everybody's falling in love
Everybody's falling in love but me
