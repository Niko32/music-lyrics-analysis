Don't you disrespect me, little man!
Don't you derogate or deride
You're in my world now, not your world
And I got friends on the other side

[SPIRITS]
He's got friends on the other side

[DR. FACILIER, spoken]
That's an echo, gentlemen
Just a little something we have here in Louisiana
A little parlor trick, don't worry...

(sung)
Sit down at my table
Put your minds at ease
If you relax, it will enable me
To do anything I please
I can read your future
I can change it 'round some, too
I'll look deep into your heart and soul

(spoken)
You do have a soul, don't you Lawrence?
You might also like(sung)
Make your wildest dreams come true
I got voodoo, I got hoodoo
I got things I ain't even tried
And I got friends on the other side

[SPIRITS]
He's got friends on the other side

[DR. FACILIER]
The cards, the cards, the cards will tell
The past, the present and the future as well
The cards, the cards, just take three
Take a little trip into your future with me
Now you, young man, are from across the sea
You come from two long lines of royalty

(spoken)
I'm a royal myself, on my mother's side

(sung)
Your lifestyle's high
But your funds are low
You need to marry a little honey whose daddy got dough
(spoken)
Mom and Dad cut you off, huh, playboy?
Now y'all gotta get hitched. But hitchin' ties you down
You just wanna be free, hop from place to place
But freedom takes green

(sung)
It's the green, it's the green, it's the green you need
And when I look into your future, it's the green that I seen
On you, little man, I don't wanna waste much time
You been pushed 'round all your life
You been pushed 'round by your mother and your sister and your brother
And if you was married
You'd be pushed 'round by your wife
But in your future, the you I see
Is exactly the man you always wanted to be

(spoken)
Shake my hand
Come on, boys, won't you shake a poor sinner's hand?

[Naveen and Lawrence shake Dr. Facilier's hands.]

[DR. FACILIER]
Yes...
Are you ready?
[SPIRITS]
Are you ready?

[DR. FACILIER]
Are you ready?

[SPIRITS]

Reformation Central

[DR. FACILIER]
Transmogrification Central
Can you feel it?
You're changin', you're changin', you're changin', all right
I hope you're satisfied
But if you ain't, don't blame me
You can blame my friends on the other side

[SPIRITS]
You got what you wanted
But you lost what you had

[DR. FACILIER]
Hush...
