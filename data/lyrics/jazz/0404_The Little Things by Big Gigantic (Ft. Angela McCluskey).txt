I could feel it coming back
I didn't know, was I built to last
I've come so far so fast
And it feels like a hundred years
Am I dreaming? Is it gonna last?

[Verse 2]
I could be better still
Than anything I've done
I know you think you could do too
I know you think you feel it's true
It's the little things in life that I feel

[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel it
'Cause I can feel it
'Cause I can feel it
It's the little things in life that I feel

[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel it
'Cause I can feel it
'Cause I can feel it

[Verse 2]
I could be better still
Than anything I've done
I know ya think you could do too
I know ya think you feel it's true
It's the little things in life that I feel
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause I can feel it
'Cause I can feel it
'Cause I can feel it

[Outro]
'Cause I can feel it
'Cause I can feel it
'Cause I can feel it
'Cause I can feel it
