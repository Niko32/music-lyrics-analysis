Poets often use many words
To say a simple thing
It takes thought and time and rhyme
To make a poem sing
With music and words I've been playing
For you, I have written a song
To be sure that you'll know what I'm saying
I'll translate as I go along

[Verse 1]
Fly me to the moon
And let me play among the stars
Let me see what spring is like
On Jupiter and Mars
In other words (In other words)
Hold my hand
In other words (In other words)
Darling, kiss me

[Verse 2]
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore
You are all I long for
All I worship and adore
In other words (In other words)
Please be true
In other words
I love youYou might also like
