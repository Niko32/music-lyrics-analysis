Clairvoyant and toothless
Foreplay with no friends
Premature until the end

I've got a secret
Babbling senseless
No one will ever know

Kids can be so cruel
Smash the feeling
Suckle the sugar breast

Too happy - a jerk beyond a smile
An asphyxiophile
I'm the Humper; stop hitting me
Walking the plank, swallowing dirt

Johnny - just skin and juice and hair
A hero unaware
Tied in a knot beneath giggling
My own two hands tickling me

Innocent friction
Boys and girls are stealing my oxygen
Sex? There's no such thing
All that's left is laughing, choking, laughing
You might also likePlaying solitaire
A rope and mommy's underwear
Hanging on, letting go
Dangling to and fro

NOOO

(Screaming)

It can't happen
It can't happen
It can't happen
It can't happen
It can't happen
It can't happen
It can't happen
It can't happen
It can't happen
Floating, floating, floating away
Floating, floating, floating away
Tingling, tingling, tingling, tingling
Tingling, tingling, tingling, tingling

Fluid seeping
Family weeping
It feels good
So bad
But please
Don't tease me
(Choking sounds)

Sex? There's no such thing
