I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

[Verse 1]
I've got a song that I sing
I can make the rain go
Anytime I move my finger
Lucky me, can't you see, I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let it go

[Chorus]
I've got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world, what a life, I'm in love

[Pre-Chorus]
Life is a beautiful thing
As long as I hold the string
I'd be a silly so-and-so
If I should ever let it go
You might also like[Chorus]
I got the world on a string
Sitting on a rainbow
Got the string around my finger
What a world
And this is the life
Hey now
I'm so in love
