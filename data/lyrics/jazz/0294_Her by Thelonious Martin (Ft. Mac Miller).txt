Baby, you got me feelin'
A high I've never known
And every time you come a-round
I don't want you to go
'Cause you so good to me (Yeah)
And you so bad to me (Yeah)
I'll never know
If the high is worth the low (Yeah)

[Verse 1: Mac Miller]
Okay
Love drug romance, may I have this slow dance?
The humbug, we can get drunk 'til the sun up (Sun up)
Got me in the zone, everything is indigo
Stay with me now, I can't deal with this alone (This alone)
I was a little nervous, you told me simmer down
I love the way you work it, the coolest bitch in town (Bitch in town)
Oh, I just want a taste
You keep me wide awake, I haven't slept in days (Days)
I disconnect from everybody, 'cause I'm here witchu
The love is spiritual, baby, you a miracle (Miracle)
You make me so happy I could whistle
Then you leave me stuck in the middle (Middle)
Nobody understands the feeling that you give me
You my vacation, sex is medication ('Cation)
I'm waitin' for the day when you're all mine
Please don't blow my high
You might also like[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Baby, you got me feelin'
A high I've never known
And every time you come a-round
I don't want you to go
'Cause you so good to me
And you so bad to me
I'll never know
If the high is worth the low

[Ad-Libs: Mac Miller]

[Verse 2: Mac Miller]
Yeah
Why you hurtin' me the way you hurt me?
Why you make me feel so dirty? Why you make me worry?
Feelin' down, need you right now, can you hurry, hurry?
Fast as a Kentucky Derby, girl, I need a pick-me-up (Girl, I need a pick-me-up)
Baby, can you be my architect?
Show me how it all connect, why you playin' hard to get? (Hard to get)
I met her in Miami
Had a bad reputation, but she tasted like candy (Like candy)
Sometimes I wish that no-one ever introduced us
You started as a new crush, but now I love you too much (Too much)
I love her when she pure
The world give her poison, I just love her when she her (She her)
[Chorus: Mac Miller]
Baby, you got me feelin'
A high I've never known
And every time you come a-round
I don't want you to go
'Cause you so good to me
And you so bad to me
I'll never know
If the high is worth the low
