I don't drink coffee, I'll take tea my dear
I like my toast done on one side
And you can hear it in my accent when I talk
I'm an Englishman in New York

[Verse 2]
See me walking down Fifth Avenue
A walking cane here at my side
I take it everywhere I walk
I'm an Englishman in New York

[Chorus]
Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York
Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York

[Verse 3]
If "manners maketh man" as someone said
Then he's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself, no matter what they say
You might also like[Chorus]
Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York
Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York

[Bridge]
Modesty, propriety, can lead to notoriety
You could end up as the only one
Gentleness, sobriety are rare in this society
At night a candle's brighter than the sun

[Saxophone solo followed by drums]

[Verse 4]
Takes more than combat gear to make a man
Takes more than a license for a gun
Confront your enemies, avoid them when you can
A gentleman will walk but never run

[Verse 3]
If "manners maketh man" as someone said
Then he's the hero of the day
It takes a man to suffer ignorance and smile
Be yourself, no matter what they say
Be yourself, no matter what they say
Be yourself, no matter what they say
[Chorus]
Whoa
(Be yourself, no matter what they say)
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York
Whoa
(Be yourself, no matter what they say)
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
I'm an Englishman in New York

[Outro]
Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
(Be yourself, no matter what they say)
Whoa
I'm an Englishman in New York
Whoa
I'm an alien, I'm a legal alien
(Be yourself, no matter what they say)
I'm an Englishman in New York
