Mount St. Helens is about to blow up
And it's gonna be a fine, swell day
Everything's gonna fall down to the ground and turn grey
All of my friends, family, and animals are probably going to run away
But me, I'm feeling curious, so I think I just might stay

[Verse 2]
The Dow Jones just fell down to zero and it's gonna be a fine, swell day
And I wonder if it's gonna be as good a day as yesterday
All of these business suits that I've just purchased
Gonna have to throw them all away
And slip into something more reasonable and then dance the night away

[Bridge 1]
I'm riding a pony
Into the sunset
Everything's green and gold
So I'm not in hell yet
And the people who work in my office went on vacation
'Cause they say that I haven't been paying them very much anymore

[Verse 3]
Mount St. Helens has a pretty cool gift shop
And I haven't been there in a while
And I've been wondering if it's even still there?
And the climate has been changing
And soon it's gonna change more
And we'll figure out all of the details in climate change court

Take a ride on my blimp
Oh, it's a very strong blimp
You can watch movies and play games
While riding on it
When the sun goes down and the sky burns out
We'll never slow down
Oh, we're not going down
[Outro]
Mount St. Helens is feeling crazy and adventurous
That's the reason that it's so special
And it takes no answers
And it gives no questions
And it makes no excuses
And it really doesn't listen
And it seems so eccentric
And it looks so active
And it dreams of puppies
And it's filled with music
[Instrumental: Mount St. Helens]
