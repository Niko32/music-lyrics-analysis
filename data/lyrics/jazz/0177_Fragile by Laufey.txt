Will you let me come closer to you
I know that you're older, but what can I do
I leave in the morning I'll forget that I am surely falling

[Pre-Chorus]
Grew up in a case of fragile glass
But hammer away it's time to crash
And as it shatters let me shatter into you

[Chorus]
The soft candle glow
The music so slow
Your skin on my skin
The room is spinning
Nerve in my bone
I'm shaking oh no
I'm talking though I shouldn't be
I've lost all sensibility
I've never been so fragile

[Verse 2]
It's been a year and forty days
Since you picked me up and swept me away
I wanted to run with you into the midnight sun with you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Now I sit around and rust in rain
Turn into dust as I just wait
For somеone to hold me like you did that night I still rеmember

[Chorus]
The soft candle glow
The music so slow
Your skin on my skin
The room kept spinning
Round I'm alone
New town on my own
I'm missing you I shouldn't be
I've lost all sensibility
I've never been so fragile
