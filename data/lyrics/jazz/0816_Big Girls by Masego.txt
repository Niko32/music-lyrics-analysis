Big white house with the chains in the mirror
Fender guitars and they hang in the air
Ladies are large, they look amazing in here
It's her birthday, got her panties in the air
Hit up the broad with the bangs in her hair
Hit up the mob and the gang in the mirror
Quit your job, stick your change in the air
Call me MJ with the man in the mirror

[Chorus]
Face down, made up
Bust down, cake up
Ladies, get your weight up
Welcome to the cake club
Face down, made up
Bust down, cake up
Ladies, get your weight up
Welcome to the cake club

[Post-Chorus]
Jiggle it, hit the room
Partner, partner sway
Jiggle it, hit the room
