[Verse 1: Marilyn Monroe & Male Skatters]
My name is Lolita
And er
I'm not supposed to
Play!
With boys!

Moi?

[Verse 2]
While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But when I do, I don't follow through
'Cause my heart belongs to daddy
If I invite a boy some night to dine on my fine finnan haddie
I just adore his asking for more, but
My heart belongs to daddy
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy, so I simply couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to daddy
Da-da-da-da, da-da-da, Daaaad
So, I want to warn you laddie
Though I know that you're perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to daddy
'Cause my daddy, he treats it so

[Verse 3]
While tearing off a game of golf
I may make a play for the caddy
But, when I do, I don't follow through
Shoog-a-dug-a-doo, shoog-a-dug-a-doo, daddy
If I invite a boy some night to cook up a fine enchilada
Though spanish rice is all very nice, Ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da
Ba-da-da, yes!
My heart belongs to my daddy, so I simply
Couldn't be bad
Yes, my heart belongs to my daddy
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da

[Outro: Marilyn Monroe & Male Skatters]
So, I want to warn you laddie
Though I know, you're perfectly swell
That my heart belongs to my daddy
'Cause daddy, my daddy
My little old daddy, he treats it so (Uh!)
That little old man he just treats it so good!
