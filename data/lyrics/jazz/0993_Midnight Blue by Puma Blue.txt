I was always afraid
To make you stay
But now my love has gone away
And maybe I
Was a fool to wish and dream
We would never dissolve like this

[Chorus]
Baby where are you
On this midnight blue?
I pray for my love to come back soon
Baby where are you
On this midnight blue?
I pray for my love to come back soon

[Verse 2]
And if I roll
Over on my side
Would I crush delicate wings
That turn my tides?
'Cause I wanna be inside
Baby, let me inside
Honey on this night where do you lie?

[Chorus]
Baby where are you
On this midnight blue?
I pray for my love to come back soon
Baby where are you
On this midnight blue?
I pray for my love to come back soon
Baby where are you
On this midnight blue?
I pray for my love to come back soon, yeah
Baby where are you on this midnight blue?
I pray for my love, to come back soon

'Cause I miss you, so
