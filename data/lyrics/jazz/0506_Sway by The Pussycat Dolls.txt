Doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo-doo
Doo, doo-doo
Doo

[Verse 1: Nicole Scherzinger]
When marimba rhythms start to play
Dance with me, make me sway
Like a lazy ocean hugs the shore
Hold me close, sway me more

[Verse 2: Nicole Scherzinger]
Like a flower bending in the breeze
Bend with me, sway with ease
When we dance you have a way with me
Stay with me, sway with me

[Pre-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger, The Pussycat Dolls]
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I go weak (I go so weak)

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

Sway me, make me
Thrill me, hold me
Bend me, ease me
You have a way with me

[Break: Kaya Jones, The Pussycat Dolls]
Hey, yeah
Sway me
Sway, sway, sway
Ba-ba-ba-ba-dada
Ba-ba-dada
Ba-ba-dada
Ba-ba-ba-ba-dada
Ba-ba-ba-dada
Ba-ba-dada

[Pre-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
Other dancers may be on the floor
Dear, but my eyes will see only you
Only you have that magic technique
When we sway, I go weak
I go weak

[Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
I can hear the sounds of violins
Long before it begins
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
[Post-Chorus: Nicole Scherzinger]
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now
Make me thrill as only you know how
Sway me smooth, sway me now

[Outro: Nicole Scherzinger]
Sway me
Sway me
Sway me now
