Grandma came to see
Something she could not believe
How could her girl be
So naive

[Refrain]
Tar baby
Tar baby told the secret she conceived

[Verse 2]
Oh, that big old smile of yours
Could turn the wind into a song
How could I have doubted
Honey, it's with me that you belong

[Refrain]
Tar baby
Tar baby, I love you so
I love you

[Chorus]
Like a brand new blade
You cut into my life
Cut through two decades
Like a hot coal on ice
You might also like[Verse 3]
Tar baby, my tar baby
It maybe was meant to be
When I look at you
I can't believe my eyes
And with your magic
I think you just might charm the birds out of the skies

[Refrain]
Tar baby, tar baby
Tar baby came good out of grief

[Bridge]
A golden thread inside of the web
That I got caught in
Oh, it's a lover's revenge
But out of the pain come the best things

[Chorus]
You cut into my life
You cut into my life (Baby, baby, baby, baby, don't you know that)
You cut into my life (I love you)
You cut into my life

[Outro]
La la la la la ooh
You can turn the wind into a song
La la la la la, baby, baby, baby
It's with me you belong
