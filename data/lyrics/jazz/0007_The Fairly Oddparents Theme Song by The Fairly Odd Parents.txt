Timmy is an average kid
That no one understands
Mom and Dad and Vicky
Always giving him commands (Bed, twerp!)
Doom and gloom up in his room
Is broken instantly
By his magic little fish who grant his every wish
'Cause in reality, they are his

[Chorus: Choir, Wanda, and Cosmo]
Oddparents, fairly oddparents
Wands and wings
Floaty, crowny things
Oddparents, fairly oddparents
Really mod, pea pod
Buff bod, hot rod

[Verse 2: Timmy Turner]
Obtuse, rubber goose, green moose, guava juice
Giant snake, birthday cake, large fries, chocolate shake!

[Outro: Choir, Vicky]
Oddparents, fairly oddparents
It flips your lid when you are a kid
With fairly oddparents!
