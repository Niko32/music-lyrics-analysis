I need you (baby)
You can make my heart go round
You, oh (alright)
You can make my heart go round

[Verse 1: Charles Bradley]
Why do I always have to wait?
Still your love's upstate
Putting my love up on a plate
Baby, can't you hear me say?

[Chorus: Charles Bradley]
I need you (baby)
You can make my heart go round
You, oh (alright)
You can make my heart go round

[Verse 2: Charles Bradley]
Ever since you said goodbye
My tears never dried
It needs work to survive
I know true love never dies

[Bridge]
You kept me by your side
You told me when I had to hide
Love me baby, feel my love
I can't go on this way
I won't go down into the light
If you can't go on, look at my love
My love grows strong
You kept me by your side
You told me when we had to hide
I know you're not this way
I know you're not this kind
Just take me high
Take me higher!
Higher
You might also like[Chorus: Charles Bradley]
I need you (baby)
You can make my heart go round
You (alright)
You can make my heart go round

[Outro: Charles Bradley]
Take me, take me, take me higher
Take me, take me, take me higher
Take me, take me, take me higher
Take me, take me, take me higher
