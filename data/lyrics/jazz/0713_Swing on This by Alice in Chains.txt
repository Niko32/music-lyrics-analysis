Mother said, "Come home"
Father said, "Come home"
Sisters said, "Come home"
So my friends said, "Come home"
And I said:

[Chorus]
"Let me be, I'm all right
Can't you see I'm just fine?
Little skinny, okay
I'm asleep anyway"

[Verse 2]
Then I heard a voice
Said, "Son, you have a choice"
I then slapped my face

[Chorus]
Let me be, I'm okay
I'm awake anyway
It's too bright over here
I can shift, cannot steer
So I drive them away
For a while, then I stay
Little skinny, okay
I'm awake anyway
You might also like[Verse 3]
Now I have to go home
Do as when in Rome

[Chorus]
Let me be, I'm all right
Can't you see I'm just fine?
Little skinny, okay
I'm asleep anyway
Let me be, I'm okay
I'm awake anyway

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Toby's still laughing
That sounds fucking pretty good
[?]'re laughing, it's like
That's tight as shit! What are you talking about? Ha hah!
