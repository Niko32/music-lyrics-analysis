I like Waka Flocka
I like Dragon Ball
I like King Krule
And I like applesauce
I like a lot of things
And I think I'm pretty cool
But nothing's cooler than just being you
(Hey)

[Verse 1]
As I talk to myself in my room, I can't help but to smile babe
'Cause I finally feel like myself, I ain’t felt that in a while babe
I don’t know who she is, where she from, all I know is that she fine babe
And I think I’m in love with someone, that I’ve made up in my mind babe (Aw yeah!)

[Chorus]
She’s a bad mama jama, straight up out of Indiana, got that perfect little twang when she talk
And her attitude's Atlanta, girl is driving me bananas, got that perfect little swang when she walk
That girl is mighty fine, I wish that I could make her mine
I’ll be waking up soon, I’m always running out of time
That girl that’s in my dreams
How perfect could she be
And what are the odds that she would fall in love with me
Oh yeah
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Oh she’s sweet as applesauce
Yeah she sweet as sugar cane
And I don’t even know her name

[Verse 2]
Really only ever been an inconvenience (to who?)
Spent a whole lotta time feeling decent (poor you!)
Hard times happen for a reason (they do!)
Someone wake me up, swear I’m dreaming (it’s true)

Grass stains on her blue jeans (grass stains)
White stripes on a table in a movie
Uma dancin, 45 moving full speed
Too good to be true, coulda fooled me

And as I️ pass through the door frame
See you there, curly hair, girl I’m so amazed
So assured, that the feeling goes both ways
Could be wrong, and then we could go our own way

And I️ can’t help but to see her
Little dress, all the girls want to be her
Lookin fine as I️ watch from the bleachers
All I know is
[Chorus]
She’s a bad mama jama, straight up out of Indiana, got that perfect little twang when she talk
And her attitude's Atlanta, girl is driving me bananas, got that perfect little swang when she walk
That girl is mighty fine, I wish that I could make her mine
I’ll be waking up soon, I’m always running out of time
That girl that’s in my dreams
How perfect could she be
And what are the odds that she would fall in love with me
Oh yeah

[Outro]
Yeah, oh she's sweet, yeah she's so sweet, yes she is
Oh yeah
Oh she's sweet like Applesauce, oh yeah
