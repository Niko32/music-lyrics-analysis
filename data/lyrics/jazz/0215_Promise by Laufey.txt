I made a promise
To distance myself
Took a flight, through aurora skies
Honestly I didn't think about
How we didn't say goodbye
Just, "See you very soon"

[Chorus]
It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you
Mm, mm-mm, mm

[Verse 2]
So I didn't call you
For sixteen long days
And I should get, a cigarette
For so much restraint
No matter how long I resist temptation
I will always lose

[Chorus]
It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you

[Bridge]
I've done the math
There's no solution
We'll never last
Why can't I let go of this?
You might also like[Verse 3]
So I broke my promise
I called you last night
I shouldn't have, I wouldn't have
If it weren't for the sight of a boy
Who lookеd just like you
Standing out on Melrose Avеnue

[Chorus]
It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you

[Outro]
It hurts to be something
It's worse to be nothing with you
