We won't segregate our thoughts
This will not be settled
Ears closed to the lips of yours
We won't segregate our thoughts
This will not be settled
Ears closed to the lips of yours

[Pre-Chorus]
Never giving it up on you
Never giving it up on you
Never changing it up for you
Never changing it up for you
Never ever gonna lose ourselves
To the man who's sitting on a chair
Maybe we should try someone new
So we could play our own game fair

[Chorus]
Aww, aww, so sentimental
Aww, aww, so sentimental
They hate this awful face
Gonna cause shit in this place, oh baby
Aww, aww, so sentimental

[Verse 2]
They won't comprehend our mind
Though it's not a battle
All of you obey the mime
They won't comprehend our mind
Though it's not a battle
All of you obey the mime
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Never giving it up on you
Never giving it up on you
Never changing it up for you
Never changing it up for you
Never ever gonna lose ourselves
To the man who's sitting on a chair
Maybe we should try someone new
So we could play our own game fair

[Chorus]
Aww, aww, so sentimental
Aww, aww, so sentimental
They hate this awful face
Gonna cause shit in this place, oh baby
Aww, aww, so sentimental

[Bridge]
Never giving it up
Never giving it up
Never changing it up
Never changing it up
Never giving it up
Never giving it up
Never changing it up
Never changing it up
[Chorus]
Aww, aww, so sentimental
Aww, aww, so sentimental
They hate this awful face
Gonna cause shit in this place, oh baby
Aww, aww

[Outro]
Aww, aww, so sentimental
Aww, aww, so sentimental
They hate this awful face
Gonna cause shit in this place, oh baby
Aww, aww, so sentimental
