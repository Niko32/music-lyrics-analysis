Mama, I don't have time for dancing

[Verse 1]
That's just gonna have to wait a while
Ain't got time for messing around
And it's not my style
This old town can slow you down
People taking the easy way
But I know exactly where I'm going
I'm gettin' closer and closer every day

[Chorus]
And I'm almost there, I'm almost there
People down here think I'm crazy
But I don't care
Trials and tribulations, I've had my share
There ain't nothing gonna stop me now
'Cause I'm almost there

[Verse 2]
I remember Daddy told me
"Fairy tales can't come true"
You gotta make 'em happen
It all depends on you
So I work real hard each and every day
Now things for sure are going my way
Just doin' what I do
Look out boys, I'm comin' through
You might also like[Chorus]
And I'm almost there, I'm almost there
People gonna come here from everywhere
And I'm almost there
I'm almost there

[Outro]
There's been trials and tribulations
You know I've had my share
But I've climbed a mountain, I've crossed a river
And I'm almost there
I'm almost there
I'm almost there
