Don’t put me into your lovely day
Cause I don’t belong to you
I put this melody from my guitar
But still I will remember you
Taught me all the love and game
At the plaza avenue
Share all the memories of you and me
But still I will remember you

[Chorus]
This smell of your lovely dear do
Taking me back to you
Please tell me something new
I write the song for two
If only there a new
You're too good to be true
And all the loves starting to blue

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
This smell of your lovely dear do
Taking me back to you
Please tell me something new
I write the song for two
If only there a new
You're too good to be true
And all the loves starting to bloom
You might also like[Verse 2]
If I could have every time
I choose to be with you
We will be family
Just you and me
But still I will remember you
We will be family
Just wait and see
My heart will be loving you

[Outro]
