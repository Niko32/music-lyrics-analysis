Detonate, detonator
Baby, oh, you blow my mind
You tell me wait, wait on ya
But baby, I can't wait all night
I go through pictures you send my phone
Oh, stop tempting me
You know what I want
I wanna make, wanna make love
Girl, I can't lie

[Chorus]
I'm just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer, you make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over, whoa
Don't make me suffer, don't make me suffer

[Verse 2]
So, here we go, go again
It's like I'm caught under your spell
You're wearing black, black magic
Well, baby, don't wear nothing else
When I open up this door, don't you play
Ain't no other man gon' make you feel the same
I wanna make, wanna make love
Girl, I can't lie
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer, you make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting (Don't keep me waiting)
You should come over, whoa (You should come, you should come, baby)
Don't make me suffer, don't make me suffer

[Bridge]
(Ah) I hate it when you get your way (Ah)
But we love, yeah, we love it, baby
Some things don't ever change
You make me suffer, baby, oh
You, you, oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
I'm just a sucker (I'm just a sucker, baby)
For a cold-hearted lover (For a cold-hearted lover)
You make me suffer (You make me suffer)
You make me suffer (You make me suffer)
Don't keep me waiting (Don't keep me waiting)
You should come over, whoa
Don't make me suffer, don't make me suffer
