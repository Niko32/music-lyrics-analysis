Whenever it's early twilight
I watch 'til a star breaks through
Funny, it's not a star I see
It's always you

[Verse 2]
Whenever I roam through roses
And lately I often do
Funny, it's not a rose I touch
It's always you

[Chorus]
If a breeze caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If I hear a melody
It's merely the way you sigh

[Verse 3]
Wherever you are, you're near me
You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love
It's always you

[Chorus]
If a breeze caresses me
It's really you strolling by
If I hear a melody
It's merely the way you sigh
You might also like[Verse 4]
Wherever you are, you're near me
You dare me to be untrue
Funny, each time I fall in love
It's always you
