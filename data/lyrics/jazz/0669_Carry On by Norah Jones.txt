And after all's been said and done
Who said it best, were you the one?
Let's just forget, leave it behind
And carry on

[Verse 2]
If you should find the time to speak
Then speak to me, I'd never keep
You from your final destiny
So carry on

[Bridge]
Into the quiet I am bound
What you have lost, I've never found
I lost my nerve, yet peace surrounds
So carry on

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Bridge]
Into the quiet I am bound
What you have lost, I've never found
I lost my nerve, yet peace surrounds
So carry on

And now that all's been said and done
Who said it best, were you the one?
Let's just forget, leave it behind
And carry on

[Outro]
Let's just forget, leave it behind
And carry on
