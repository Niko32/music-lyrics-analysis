My heart is sad and lonely
For you, I sigh, for you, dear, only
Why haven't you seen it?
I'm all for you, body and soul

[Verse 2: Amy Winehouse]
I spend my days in longin'
And wonderin' why it's me you're wrongin'
I tell you I mean it
I'm all for you, body and soul

[Pre-Chorus: Tony Bennett, Amy Winehouse]
I can't believe it, it's hard to conceive it
That you'd turn away romance, oh
Are you pretendin'? It looks like the endin'
Unless I could have one more chance to prove it, dear

[Chorus: Tony Bennett, Amy Winehouse & Both]
My life, a wreck, you're making
You know I'm yours for just the takin'
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you, body and soul

[Pre-Chorus: Tony Bennett]
Are you pretending? It looks like the ending
Unless I can have one more chance to prove, dear
You might also like[Chorus: Amy Winehouse, Tony Bennett & Both]
My life, a wreck, you're makin'
You know I'm yours for just the taking
I'd gladly surrender
Myself to you, body and soul
