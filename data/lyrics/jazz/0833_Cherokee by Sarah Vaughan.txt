Brave Indian warrior
Since first I met you
I can't forget you
Cherokee sweetheart
Child of the prairie
Your love keeps calling
My heart enthralling
You Cherokee

[Bridge]
In the summertime
Of lover time gone by
From my memory
So tenderly inside

[Verse 2]
My brave Indian warrior
One day I'll hold you
In my arms hold you
My Cherokee

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
In the summertime
Of lover time gone by
From my memory
So tenderly inside
You might also like[Outro]
My brave Indian warrior
One day I'll hold you
In my arms I'll hold you
My Cherokee
