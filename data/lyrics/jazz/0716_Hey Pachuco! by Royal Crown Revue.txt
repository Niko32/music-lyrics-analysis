Hey

Summer of '43
The man's gunnin' for me
Blue and white mean war tonight
Say damn my pride
And all the other cats livin' down eastside
Or maybe just my brim's too wide

Ooh, Marie
You better grab my jack and zip gun for me
And I'll face no shame
'Cause tonight's the night I die for our name

Well, I'd like to be swingin'
Dancin' and swingin'
Just havin' a time
Free to do whatever
Now more than ever
I've gotta stick with that gang of mine
