From where you are
You see the smoke start to arise where they play cards
And you walk over, softly movin' past the guards
The stakes are gettin' higher, you can feel it in your heart
He calls your bluff
He is the ace, you never thought he'd play that much
And now it's more than all these cards you want to touch
You'll never know if winnin' this could really be enough

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Take a look
Beyond the moon you'll see the stars
And when you look around
You know the room by heart

[Chorus]
I have never dreamed it
Have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it
I may never see a night like this
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it?
I have never dreamed
Dreamed a night like this

How many times
Have I been waiting by the door to hear these chimes
To hear that someone debonair has just arrived
And opened up to see my world before my eyes
That silhouette
Creates an image and a night I can't forget
It has the scent of something specialâ€”I can't rest
If I resist temptation, oh, I know for sure that I will lose the bet

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I walk away
And suddenly it seems I'm not alone
In front of me he stands
I stop before he goes

[Chorus]
I have never dreamed it
Have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it
I may never see a night like this
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it?
I have never dreamed
Dreamed a night like this
[Chorus]
I have never dreamed it
Have you ever dreamed a night like this?
I cannot believe it
I may never see a night like this
When everything you think is incomplete
Starts happening when you are cheek to cheek
Could you ever dream it?
I have never dreamed
Dreamed a night like this
