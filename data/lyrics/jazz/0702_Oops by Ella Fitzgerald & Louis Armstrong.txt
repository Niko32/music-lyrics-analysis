Oops, my heart went oops
The moment that we met, my heart went oops
I never will forget, my heart turned hoops
The moment that I met you

[Verse 2: Ella Fitzgerald]
Oops, my feet went oops
I nearly took a spill, my knees went oops
They shook a bit until my head went oops
You mustn't let it get you

[Bridge: Louis Armstrong]
I was going for a very
Choo'd call a solitary sorta stroll
Just a twiddle of my thumb
When I heard a lot of drum begun to pound and roar

[Verse 3: Ella Fitzgerald]
And, oops, my heart went oops
It went into a spin of loop-di-loops
You must've thought me kin to nincompoops
The silly way I acted

[Verse 4: Louis Armstrong & Ella Fitzgerald]
Of course you wouldn't know
That you were so aglow
And I was so attracted
But, baby, take a bow
My heart is going oops right now
You might also like[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5: Ella Fitzgerald]
Pops, you are the tops
The moment that my eyes behold your chops
You lift me to the skies, my heart flip-flops
You shouldn't make it make like that

[Verse 6: Louis Armstrong]
Mmm, belle, my buxom belle
I'm still in love with you 'cause truth tell
And always kinda knew that we would gel
'Cause jam could never shake like that

[Bridge: Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong]
I was going for a frantic
But completely unromantic sort of drive
But I knew you wouldn't quit
When I dug you and you hit me with that old-time jive
(Sing it, Ella)

[Verse 7: Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong, Both]
Then, oops, my heart went oops
Sitting on the stoops, the local droops
They nearly flipped their toups, I mean, in groups
The silly way we acted
Of course they couldn't know
That you were so aglow
And I was so attracted
Yes, baby, take a bow
My heart is going oops, oops, oops
Oops, oops right now
[Outro: Ella Fitzgerald & Louis Armstrong]
Oops
Oops, then
