When I fall in love
It will be forever
Or I'll never fall in love

[Verse 2]
In a restless world
Like this is
Love has ended before it's begun
And too many moonlight kisses
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun

[Verse 3]
When I give my heart
It will be completely
Or I'll never give my heart

[Verse 4]
And the moment I can feel that
You feel that way too
Is when I fall in love
With you

[Verse 5]
And the moment I can feel that
You feel that way too
Is when I fall in love with youYou might also like
