Ode to the old, and to the new
We rededicate this song to you

[Chorus]
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
One more, one more

[Verse 1]
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
No wings of wax or endless mountains
Tragedies with penniless fountains
It's just cherries, cherries
It's coming up cherries on top
Sunset shadows through the trophies
I guess it just ain't big enough
Say it one more, one more, one more

[Chorus]
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough

It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
One more, one more

[Verse 2]
We've been falling, falling
It's like we fell to the top
I was born to cut a million
Cut my teeth and made a killing
Now I'm dodging, dodging
Everything you think that I'm not
Archetype of television
Was lost in thought but held the vision, hey

[Bridge]
When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
Quick charade, Beyonc√©, Lemonade
When you gonna say my name?
When you gonna say my name?
No delay, no halfway, let me hear you say
One more, one more, one more
[Chorus]
Silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
Fuck a silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough

[Post-Chorus]
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top
It's just cherries, cherries
Everything is cherries on top

[Outro]
Silver lining
Fuck a silver lining
'Cause only gold is hot enough, hot enough
