Now you say you're lonely
You cry the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

[Verse 2]
Now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

[Bridge]
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

[Verse 3]
And now you say you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you
You might also like[Outro]
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
