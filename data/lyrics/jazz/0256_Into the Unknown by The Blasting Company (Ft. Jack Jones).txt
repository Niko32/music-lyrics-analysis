Led through the mist
By the milk-light of moon
All that was lost is revealed
Our long bygone burdens
Mere echoes of the spring
But where have we come?
And where shall we end?
If dreams can't come true
Then why not pretend?

[Verse 2]
How the gentle wind
Beckons through the leaves
As autumn colors fall
Dancing in a swirl
Of golden memories
The loveliest lies of allYou might also like
