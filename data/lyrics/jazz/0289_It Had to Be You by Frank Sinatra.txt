Why do I do just as you say?
Why must I just give you your way?
Why do I sigh?
Why don't I try to forget?
It must have been that something lovers call fate
Kept me saying, "I had to wait"
I saw them all
Just couldn't fall 'til we met

[Chorus]
It had to be you
It had to be you
I wandered around and I finally found
The somebody who
Could make me be true
And could make me be blue
And even be glad just to be sad thinking of you

[Verse 2]
Some others I've seen
Might never be mean
Might never be cross or try to be boss
But they wouldn't do
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you
You might also like[Outro]
For nobody else gave me a thrill
With all your faults, I love you still
It had to be you, wonderful you
It had to be you
