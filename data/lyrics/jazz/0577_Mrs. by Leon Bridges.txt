I tried to let go we end up on the floor
And you try to leave when I need you the most
Sometimes I wonder what we holding on for
Then you climb on top of me and I remember

[Verse 2]
You know that I think you the love of my life
But lovin' and hatin' is such a fine line
Sometimes I wonder why I went knockin' on ya door
Then you climb on top of me and I remember

[Pre-Chorus]
I remember how it felt the first few times
Skin-to-skin before you knew how to get under mine
If we get it, get it right we'll be together for life
'Cause it only feels good after a good, good fight

[Chorus]
Mrs., Mrs., when we talk like
Mrs., Mrs., when we love
Mrs., Mrs., when we're touching
Mrs., Mrs., and that sound when ya ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh

[Verse 3]
Fussing and fighting and eye for an eye
Your shoulders get colder and colder all the time
Sometimes I wonder why I went knockin' on ya door
Then you come knock, knock, knockin' on mine and I remember
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I remember how it felt the first few times
Skin-to-skin before you knew how to get under mine
If we get it, get it right we'd be together for life
'Cause it only feels good after a good, good fight

[Chorus]
Mrs., Mrs., when we talk like
Mrs., Mrs., when we love, love
Mrs., Mrs., when we're touchin'
Mrs., Mrs., a lil bit of everything

Mrs., Mrs., when we talk like
Mrs., Mrs., a lil bit of that love
Mrs., Mrs., when we're touchin'
Mrs., Mrs., a lil bit of everything
Oh, oh, whoa, yeah

[Outro]
When you say them things I like, I know it's all worth the fight
