Ooh, make love to me
One more time, before you go away
Why can't you stay?
Ooh, my love...Come home to me
Just for a while, I'll leave this piece of you
Why can't you stay?

[Chorus]
Don't run away
Don't slip away, my dear
Don't run away
Don't slip away, my dear
(Don't ruin this heart of mine)

[Verse 2]
The sun is gone
It fell into the fall
But I don't want it this way
Why can't you stay?

[Chorus]
Don't run away
Don't slip away, my dear
Don't run away
Don't slip away, my dear
Dont run away
You might also like[Verse 3]
There should be words
There should be words that explain the way
But I'm tongue tied and twisted
Where's those words...

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
Don't run away
Don't slip away, my dear
