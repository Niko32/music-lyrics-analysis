[Verse 1]
If I want you, be my lady
I'm gon' call you
Call, call, call you, lady lady, lady lady
If I think you'd be my baby
I'm gon' shoot my shot and call you, lady lady, lady lady

[Chorus]
If you classy but you're reckless
Then you gon' get you's a necklace, lady lady, lady lady

[Verse 2]
She got me
Wondering
If I
Should make
Her my baby
Lady lady
Shake some
Shake some
On the run
Maybe I should say the things I type online in real life, maybe
Fade, uh, I can't, yes, I can
I can feel it, she feel it, we feel it, we feel it
I know she want it, she want it, she want it
Girl, you know I love ya

Happy that you're my baby
Happy to call you my lady, you're special
Happy that you're my baby

[Chorus]
If you classy but you're reckless
Then you gon' get you's a necklace, lady lady, lady lady
If you classy but you're reckless
Then you gon' get you's a necklace, lady lady, lady lady
