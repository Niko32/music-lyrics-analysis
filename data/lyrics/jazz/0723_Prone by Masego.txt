I been, huh
I been on the drank, I been on the weed
I've been on the plane, I been overseas

The same old scenes, the same old sites
I been on the road, I been on the train
I been on the boat, running from the pain
See ya there, I can't resist
See ya stare, feel ya kiss
Subliminal criminal, tease
Minimal, minimal, minimal (Yeah)
Seminal, seminal D
Animal, animal, animal
Intimate intervals, each and every time
I go in and to her garden
