Little birdie, why do you fly upside-down?
It's amazing that the way you get around
Little birdie, why you worry like you do?
Don't you worry, you just do what you can do

[Verse 2]
Little birdie, things just fascinate you so
And your friend there likes to show you what he knows
Little birdie, he don't mind the way he should
He needs watching, that's when you know he'll be good

[Verse 3]
Little birdie, can't your friend do nothin' right?
It just seems now all he wants to do is fight
Little birdie, look at what he's tryin' to do
It's so easy, yet he don't know what to doYou might also like
