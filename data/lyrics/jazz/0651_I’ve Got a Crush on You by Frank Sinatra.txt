How glad the many millions of Annabelles and Lillians
Would be to capture me
But you had such persistence, you wore down my resistance
I fell and it was swell

[Verse 2]
I'm your big and brave and handsome Romeo
How I won you, I shall never, never know
It's not that you're attractive, but, oh, my heart grew active
When you came into view

[Verse 3]
I've got a crush on you, sweetie pie
All the day and nighttime, hear me sigh
I never had the least notion
That I could fall with so much emotion

[Verse 4]
Could you coo, could you care
For a cunning cottage that we could share?
The world will pardon my mush
'Cause I have got a crush on you, my baby, on youYou might also like
