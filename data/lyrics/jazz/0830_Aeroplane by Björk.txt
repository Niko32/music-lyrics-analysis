I can not live
Peacefully without you
For even a moment
I miss you terribly
When you're away

[Chorus]
He's away
This ain't right
I'm alone
I'm taking an aeroplane
Across the world
To follow my heart

[Verse 2]
How come out of all the people in the world
Only one can make me complete?
One word, one word on the phone
Makes me happy
One touch, but one touch directly
Makes me ecstatic

[Chorus]
He's away
This ain't right
I'm alone
I'm taking an aeroplane
Across the world
To follow my heartYou might also like
