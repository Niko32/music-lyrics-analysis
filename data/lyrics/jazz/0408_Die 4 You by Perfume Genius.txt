Limit every second left
Until I'm off balance
Oh, love
I'm there in spirit, ooh
Each and every breath I spend
You are collecting

[Chorus]
Oh, love
See it through
I would die for you

[Verse 2]
Each and every breath I spend
You are collecting, mm
Limit every second left
'Til I'm off balance, mm
Each and every breath I spend

[Chorus]
Oh, my love, oh, my love
Take your time
Oh, my love, take your time
Oh, my love, oh my love
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh my love, oh my love
Take your time
Oh, my love, take your time
See it through
