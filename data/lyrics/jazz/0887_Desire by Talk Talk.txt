Desire
Whispered, spoken
In time
Rivers, oceans

[Chorus]
That ain't me, babe
That ain't me, babe
That ain't me, babe
I'm just content to relax than drown within myself

[Verse 2]
Of mind
Sheltered, broken
Denied
Gifted, stolen

[Chorus]
That ain't me, babe
That ain't me, babe
That ain't me, babe
Ain't got a bed of excuse for myself

[Instrumental]

That ain't me, babe
Ain't got a bed of excuse for myself
That ain't me, babe
That ain't me, babe
That ain't me, babe
I'm just content to relax than drown within myself
