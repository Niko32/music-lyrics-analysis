Son you better be ready for love
On this glory day
This is your chance to believe
What I've got to say
Keep your eyes on the sky
Put a dollar in the kitty
Don't the moon look pretty

[Chorus]
Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind
(Time out of mind)

[Verse 2]
I am holding the mystical sphere
It's direct from Lhasa
Where people are rolling in the snow
Far from the world we know

[Pre-Chorus]
Children we have it right here
It's the light in my eyes
It's perfection and grace
It's the smile on my face
You might also like[Chorus]
Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind
(Time out of mind)

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
Children we have it right here
It's the light in my eyes
It's perfection and grace
It's the smile on my face

[Chorus]
Tonight when I chase the dragon
The water may change to cherry wine
And the silver will turn to gold
Time out of mind

[Instrumental Outro]
