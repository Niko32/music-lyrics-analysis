Hello again, remember me?
We were making love
But just getting started
This is Foreplay

[Verse 1]
Yeah I've been looking for some feeling
But you've been looking other ways
Yeah, I've been holding for some time now
And you’ve been going astray

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, I’ve been holding on for way too long
Trying to solve it all
Yeah, holding on forever
Oh, to learn

[Verse 2]
Yeah, you’ve been on a different wavelength
And I just don’t know what to do
But every time I see you, yeah
You’re getting me all confused

[Chorus 2]
Yeah, I’ve been trying this for way too long
Trying to solve it all
Holding on forever
Oh, to learn

[Bridge]
It seems some things don’t change
And I don’t know why
But every time I see you, girl
Ooh

[Outro]
'Cause you've been on another wavelength
While I’ve been looking for some feeling
'Cause I've been waiting on
I've been waiting for
Waiting for you
