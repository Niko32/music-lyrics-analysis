Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz

[Verse 1]
Have you seen the well-to-do
Up and down Park Avenue
On that famous thoroughfare
With their noses in the air?
High hats and arrow collars
White spats and lots of dollars
Spending every dime
For a wonderful time

[Chorus]
Now if you're blue
And you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the ritz
Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes and cutaway coat
Perfect fits
Puttin' on the ritz
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper
Trying hard to look like Gary Cooper, super duper

[Verse 2]
Come let's mix
Where Rockefellers walk with sticks
Or umbrellas in their mitts
Puttin' on the ritz

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Now if you're blue
And you don't know where to go to
Why don't you go where fashion sits?
Puttin' on the ritz
Different types who wear a day coat
Pants with stripes and cutaway coat
Perfect fits
Puttin' on the ritz

[Post-Chorus]
Dressed up like a million dollar trouper
Trying mighty hard to look like super duper, Mister Cooper
[Verse 3]
Come, let's mix
Where Rockefellers walk with sticks
Or umbrellas in their mitts
Puttin' on the ritz

[Outro]
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz
Puttin' on the ritz
