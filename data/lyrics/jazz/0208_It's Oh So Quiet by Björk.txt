Shhhh, shhhh

[Verse 1]
It's oh, so quiet
Shhhh, shhhh
It's oh, so still
Shhhh, shhhh
You're all alone
Shhhh, shhhh
And so peaceful until

[Chorus 1]
You fall in love
Zing, boom
The sky up above
Zing, boom
Is caving in
Wow, bam

[Bridge 1]
You've never been so nuts about a guy
You wanna laugh, you wanna cry
You cross your heart and hope to die

[Verse 2]
Till it's over, and then
Shhhh, shhhh
It's nice and quiet
Shhhh, shhhh
But soon again
Shhhh, shhhh
Starts another big riot
You might also like[Chorus 2]
You blow a fuse
Zing, boom
The devil cuts loose
Zing, boom
So what's the use
Wow, bam
Of falling in love?

[Verse 3]
It's oh, so quiet
It's oh, so still
You're all alone
And so peaceful until

[Chorus 3]
You ring the bell
Bim bam
You shout and you yell
Hi ho-ho
You broke the spell

[Bridge 2]
Gee, this is swell, you almost have a fit
This guy is “gorge” and I got hit
There's no mistake, this is it!
[Verse 4]
Till it's over, and then
It's nice and quiet
Shhhh, shhhh
But soon again
Shhhh, shhhh
Starts another big riot

[Chorus 2]
You blow a fuse
Zing, boom
The devil cuts loose
Zing, boom
So what's the use
Wow, bam
Of falling in love?

[Outro]
The sky caves in
The devil cuts loose
You blow, blow, blow, blow, blow your fuse
Aaaaah!
When you fall in love
Ssshhhhhh
