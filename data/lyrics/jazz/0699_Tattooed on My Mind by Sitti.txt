Maybe you'll soon forget about all
Maybe you'll miss it like I do
One thing's for sure
I'm all knocked out
Spend so much time thinking of you

[Chorus]
And I can't get you out of my dreams
Now I know that you're the dangerous kind
And your smile is tattooed on my mind
And I can't get you out of my dreams

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna write
I don't wanna call
I would not know what to say
'Cause baby it should be you
That's how I want it to be
Tell me you feel the same way

[Chorus]
And I can't get you out of my dreams
Now I know that you're the dangerous kind
And your smile is tattooed on my mind
And I can't get you out of my dreams
You might also like[Verse 3]
Yesterday, I was feelin' safe
Baby all I do today, I try to be brave
And no melody can seem to soothe my mind (my mind)
And now I curse you for bein' so sweet and so kind

[Chorus]
And I can't get you out of my dreams
Now I know that you're the dangerous kind
And your face is tattooed on my mind
And I can't get you out of my dreams

[Coda: 4x]
Yes, I know, you're tattooed
On my mind, you're tattooed
