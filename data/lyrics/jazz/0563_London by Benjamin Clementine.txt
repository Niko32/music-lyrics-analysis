Now as he sits on the back of this grey caravan
Tomorrow he will probably be
Jumping Parisian metro barriers with
A bottle in his hands

[Verse 2]
Sparkling, sparkling water mixed with
Peaches and rum
Honestly I don’t drink but if I did this will
Be my favorite punch, he said

[Verse 3]
Walk out the door with her
And he could see everyone
Dressed in black a class
That seems too far too fetched

[Pre-Chorus 1]
She said, “Look at you, look at you, the game is over
The cup is full, your cup is full, stop praying for more exposure”

[Pre-Chorus 2]
“It is obvious that you are trying
Dubious stop or you will die here
You’re pretending but no one is buying”
You might also like[Chorus 1]
London, London, London is calling you, what are you waiting for
What you searching for?
London, London, London is all in you, why are you denying the truth?
“I might, I might, I might be boring you” he said
“Although it’s not clear as the morning dew
When my preferred ways are not happening
I won’t underestimate whom I am capable of becoming”

[Verse 4]
History will be made today is written
Boldly on his face
So clear you could hardly miss it
You could hardly miss it

[Verse 5]
For transcending the barriers of
Yesterday was and is the dream
On a road where Cleopatra comes and goes
Like fishes caught in ponds then thrown back for fun

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She said, “look at you, look at you, just pick a fleet
Your cup is full, your cup is full, what have you not yet achieved?”

[Pre-Chorus 2]
“It is obvious that you are trying
Dubious stop or you will die here
You’re pretending but no one is buying”
[Chorus 2]
London, London, London is calling you, what are you waiting for
What you searching for?
London, London, London is all in you, why are you in denial of the truth?
“I might, I might, I might be boring you”, he said
“Although it’s not clear as the morning due
When my preferred ways are not happening
I won’t underestimate who I am capable of becoming”
