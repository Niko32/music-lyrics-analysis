A flower lady's daughter
As sweet as holy water
Said: "I'm a school reporter
Please teach me," mmm, I taught her

[Verse 2]
Two-fingered Levi'd sister
Said, "Peace," I stopped I kissed her
Said, "I'm a male resister,"
I smiled and just unzipped her

[Verse 3]
High-diving Chinese trender
Black hair and black suspender
Said, "Please, me no surrender
Just love to feel your Fender."

[Chorus]
All of you know that the girls of the road
Are like apples we stole in our youth
All of you know that the girls of the road
Been around and are versed in the truth

[Verse 4]
Stone-headed Frisco spacer
Ate all the meat I gave her
Said would I like to taste hers
And even craved the flavour
Like marron-glac√©ed fish bones
"Oh lady hit the road!"
You might also like[Chorus]
All of you know that the girls of the road
Are like apples we stole in our youth
All of you know that the girls of the road
Been around and are versed in the truth

[Outro]
Ladies of the road
Ladies of the road
Ladies of the road
Ladies of the road
