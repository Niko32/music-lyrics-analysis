Five, six, seven, eight!

[Overture]

[VELMA]
Come on, babe, why don't we paint the town?
And all that jazz
I'm gonna rouge my knees and roll my stockings down
And all that jazz
Start the car, I know a whoopee spot
Where the gin is cold, but the piano's hot
It's just a noisy hall where there's a nightly brawl
And all...that...jazz

[BANDLEADER]
Skidoo!

[VELMA]
And all that jazz

[COMPANY]
Hot-cha!
Whoopee!

[VELMA]
And all that jazz
You might also like[VELMA]
Slick your hair and wear your buckle shoes
And all that jazz
I hear that Father Dip is gonna blow the blues
And all that jazz
Hold on, hon, we're gonna bunny hug
I bought some aspirin down at United Drug
In case you shake apart and want a brand new start
To do... that...

[ROXIE]
Jazz!

[VELMA]
Find a flask; we're playing fast and loose
And all that jazz
Right up here is where I store the juice
And all that jazz
Come on, babe, we're gonna brush the sky
I betcha Lucky Lindy never flew so high
Cause in the stratosphere how could he lend an ear
To all... that... jazz

[VELMA]
Oh, you're gonna see your Sheba shimmy shake
[VELMA/COMPANY]
And all that jazz

[VELMA]
Oh, she's gonna shimmy 'till her garters break

[VELMA/COMPANY]
And all that jazz

[VELMA]
Show her where to park her girdle
Oh, her mother's blood'll curdle

[VELMA/COMPANY]
If she'd hear her baby's queer

[VELMA]
For all... that... jazz
All... that... jazz

[VELMA (COMPANY)]
Come on, babe, why don't we paint the town? (Oh, you're gonna see your Sheba shimmy shake)
And all that jazz (And all that jazz)
I'm gonna rouge my knees and roll my stockings down (Oh, she's gonna shimmy 'till her garters break)
And all that jazz (And all that jazz)
Start the car, I know a whoopee spot (Show her where to park her girdle)
Where the gin is cold, but the piano's hot (Oh, her mother's blood will curdle)
It's just a noisy hall where there's a nightly brawl (If she'd hear her baby's queer)
And all... that... (Jazz)
[VELMA]
No, I'm no one's wife, but
Oh, I love my life
And all
That
Jazz!

[ALL, spoken]
That jazz!
