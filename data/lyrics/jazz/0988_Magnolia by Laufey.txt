Magnolia
She could have anyone in the world
Floats around town in a golden gown
Born in a castle on a cloud

Magnolia
Prettiest girl that I know
Stars in her eyes
Handpicked from the skies
Beautiful soul

[Chorus]
How can I compete with her?
Perfection is the only word
I think of when I think of Magnolia
She doesn't know that the world is turning just for her
I wish I could be Magnolia

[Verse 2]
Magnolia
She can move oceans and rivers with ease
A word from her lips
Her sirens kiss
Will send you straight into abyss
You might also likeMagnolia
I wish she'd give her secrets away
Enchants еveryone
And I think it'd be fun
To bе like her someday

[Chorus]
But I cannot compete with her
Perfection is the only word
I think of when I think of Magnolia
She doesn't know that the world is turning just for her
I wish I could be Magnolia

[Outro]
Magnolia
