I think about the day I met
The perfect stranger
I think about us
And I think about the day I got a-wrapped
Around your finger
I think about us

[Pre-Chorus 1]
The sun was shinin' on you
The Lord was smilin' on me
And love was callin' us
I had my mind made up

[Chorus 1]
And I can't stop lovin' you
I can't help myself
And I can't get over you
No matter what I tell myself, baby

[Verse 2]
Never thought I'd ever love any one else
In my weakness
I think about us
And I think about the day you left
Without speakin'
I think about us
I think about the love we had
For our children
I think about us
I think about the way we laughed
Without a reason
I think about us, girl, ooh, yay
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
There will be no more lies
Somebody tell me why I feel like I'm dyin'
Lord what's come over me
Ooh, baby, can't you see

[Chorus 2]
That I can't stop lovin' you (I can't stop lovin' you, girl)
I can't help myself, ooh, babe
And I can't get over you (I can't get over you, baby)
No matter what I tell myself, baby, yeah (No matter what, no matter what I tell myself, babe)
I can't stop lovin' you (I can't, stop lovin' you, girl, stop lovin' you, girl)
No matter how hard I try, yeah (No matter how hard I try)
And I can't get over you, babe (And I can't, get over you, babe)
And I don't know why

[Interlude]
I think about us
I think about us
I think about us
And think about us
Think about us
I think about us
I think about us

[Outro]
Mmm, babe
I can't get over you
Mmm, yeah, babe
Mmm, girl
What am I gonna do?
Mmm, babe
I think about, the love we had
I think about, the way you laugh
Mmm, girl, hey
I can't get over you
I can't stop kissin' you, babe
I can't stop wantin' you, babe
I can't stop lovin' you, girl
Yeah, ay-ay-ay
Can't get over you
I can't stop missin' you, girl
I can't stop feelin' you, girl
I can't stop thinkin' 'bout ya
I can't stop dreamin' 'bout ya
I can't stop lovin' you, girl
