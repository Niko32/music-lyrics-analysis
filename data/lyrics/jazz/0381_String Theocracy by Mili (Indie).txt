Open the curtains
Lights on
Don't miss a moment of this experiment
Oh, the book is strange
Like clockwork orange
Keep your eyes buttered till the end

[Verse 1]
Which "you" are you going to be?
Hmm, inside the mirror do you see (Ha)
Someone else in that body?

[Verse 2]
Dance for me, one and two and three and turn around
Sit like a doggy till I finish my read

[Chorus]
Cut it off, cut down your loss
All that stubborn loyalty is gonna get you killed
In a world built on convenient theories
For the puppets on TV
There is comfort in the strings
If you're gonna control me
At least make it interesting theatrically
You might also like[Verse 3]
How does it feel to be free?
Hmm, "why don't you try it yourself?" (Ha)
The gate opened on me

[Verse 4]
So I leaped down, down, and down I go
I tell myself I'm a tough girl
Down, down, and down I go
I could never, ever, ever touch the soil
My heart goes right, my head goes left
And end up on your bed, huh

[Verse 5]
Sure I'll be your marionette
Here, tug on my thread
Spread me open for dolly pink, Snow White,  artificial beauty
Maybe we're all cold machines
Stuffed in the human skin
With human sins sewed up by the gods of city

[Chorus]
Cut it off, you've already lost
All that precious bravery is gonna get you hurt
In a world that feeds on the minority
May that self-centered belief lead you to peace
If you're gonna replace me
At least have the audacity to kill me thoroughly
[Verse 6]
When does it end for me?
Hmm, I think I am done with everything (Ha)
Now I'm ready to leave

[Verse 7]
Dragging out one line, two lines, three lines
Connect our hands
When I no longer can live on knowledge alone

[Outro]
You gave me strength
Hopeful curiosity
Maybe there are still happy answers left for my discovery
What's the colour of the electric sheep you see?
And if you love me
Can you love your everything too, for me?
