My story is much too sad to be told
But practically everything
Leaves me totally cold
The only exception I know is the case
When I'm out on a quiet spree
Fighting vainly the old ennui
And I suddenly turn and see
Your fabulous face

[Chorus]
I get no kick from champagne
Mere alcohol doesn't thrill me at all
So tell me why should it be true
That I get a kick out of you
Some get a kick from cocaine
I'm sure that if I took even one sniff
That would bore me terrifically too
Yet I get a kick out of you

[Bridge]
I get a kick every time I see
You standing there before me
I get a kick though it's clear to me
You obviously don't adore me
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high
With some guy in the sky is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick out of you
You might also like[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
I get no kick in a plane
Flying too high
With some guy in the sky is my idea of nothing to do
Yet I get a kick out of you
