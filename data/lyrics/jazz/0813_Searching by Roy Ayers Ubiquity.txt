Up in the sky
I got a story to say
And I'll tell you why
I'm searchin'!

You see, my friend
I need someone
Who feels and needs
The same as I
I'm searchin'!

What's right is right
What's wrong is wrong
I'm gonna sing my song
All day long
I'm searchin'!

[Chorus]
Searchin'
Searchin'
Searchin'
Searchin'
Searchin'
Searchin'
Searchin'
Searchin'
Searchin'
Searchin'
Searchin'
Searchin'
Searchin'
Searchin'
Searchin'

I don't believe
And I just know
I can't conceive
I'm searchin'
When love is gone
And one believes
That love will come
Like brand new leaves
I'm searchin'
And then the day
When I will say
That my soul lives
A truthful way
I'm searchin'

Say butterfly
Up in the sky
I got a story to say
And I'll tell you why
I'm searchin'

You see my friend
And I need someone
Who feels and needs
The same as I
I'm searchin'
When it's right,it's right
When it's wrong,it's wrong
I'm gonna sing my song
All day long
I'm searchin'

Say butterfly
Up in the sky
I got a story to say
And I'll tell you why
I'm searchin'

Searchin' for my right mind
Searchin' for my right mind
Searchin' for a new love
Searchin' for my true time
Searchin' for completion
Searchin' for completion
Searchin' for the true time
Searchin' for a new love
Searchin' for the right mind
Searchin' for the right love
Searchin' for the right love
Searchin' for my right mind
