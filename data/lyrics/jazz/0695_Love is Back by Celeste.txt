Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
For a moment, there it goes
Turn around, next thing you know
Love is back

[Verse 1]
Oh, my God, I feel so bored
I'm startin' to realise that all the boys that I find
Are all trouble, I told my mother
She said, "Girl, get your glass full"
So I did and I saw

[Pre-Chorus]
You
I saw you gleaming across the scene, across the room
It's all in you
I need the meaning when I see it all in you

[Chorus]
Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
For a moment, there it goes
Turn around, next thing you know
Love is back
You might also like[Verse 2]
Hallelujah, it's nice to know you
It's so peculiar how you've come and changed my mind
I'll fall head first, I hope it doesn't hurt
What's your preference? 'Cause I know mine

[Pre-Chorus]
And it's you
Foolish of me to say these things, but I want to
I know it's all in you
Don't need a reason when I see it all in you

[Chorus]
Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
Love is back
For a moment, there it goes
Turn around, next thing you know
Love is back

[Bridge]
Might be foolish or out my mind
Must've said it a thousand times
Can't be lyin' if I see the truth
I know who and I look at you
Might be too young to realise
If there's a mountain, I should've climbed it
[Outro]
But love
Love is back
Love is back
Good thing I know, I know love is back
And I know that love is back
Love is back
Love is back, mm-mm-mm
Love is back, oh, yeah
Love is back
Love is back
