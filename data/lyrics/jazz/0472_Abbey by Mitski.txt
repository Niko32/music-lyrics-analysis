I am hungry
I have been hungry
I was born hungry
What do I need?
I am something
I have been something
I was born something
What could I be?

[Chorus 1]
There is a light that I can see
But only, it seems, when there's darkness in me
There is a dream that I sometimes see
That only appears in the dark of sleep

[Verse 2]
I am waiting
I have been waiting
I was born waiting
I was born waiting
For that something
Just to want something
I was born something
I was born
You might also like[Chorus 2]
There is a light, I feel it in me
But only, it seems, when the dark surrounds me
There is a dream and it sleeps in me
To awake in the night, crying "Set me free"
And I awake every night, crying "Set me free"
