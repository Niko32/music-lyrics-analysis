Jenny, darling, you're my best friend
But there's a few things that you don't know of
Why I borrow your lipstick so often
I'm using your shirt as a pillow case

[Chorus]
I wanna ruin our friendship
We should be lovers instead
I don't know how to say this
'Cause you're really my dearest friend

[Verse 2]
Jenny, darling, you're my best friend
I've been doing bad things that you don't know about
Stealing your stuff now and then
Nothing you'd miss, but it means the world to me

[Chorus]
I wanna ruin our friendship
We should be lovers instead
I don't know how to say this
'Cause you're really my dearest friend
I wanna ruin our friendship
I don't know how to say this
'Cause you're really my dearest friend
You might also like[Bridge]
Jenny, take my hand
'Cause we are more than friends
I will follow you until the end
Jenny, take my hand
I cannot pretend
Why I never like your new boyfriends
Oh, your love for them won't last long
(Forget those amigos)
Oh, your love for them won't last long
(Forget those amigos)
Forget those amigos

[Chorus]
I wanna ruin our friendship
We should be lovers instead
I don't know how to say this
'Cause you're really my dearest friend
Oh, your love for them won't last long
(We should be lovers instead)
Oh, your love for them won't last long
('Cause you're really my dearest friend)

[Outro]
Jenny...
Oh, love like that won't last
(We should be lovers instead)
Jenny...
'Cause you're really my dearest friend
Jenny...
