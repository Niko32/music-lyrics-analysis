My love has got no power, he's got his strong beliefs
My love has got no fame, he's got his strong beliefs

Freedom and love, what he's looking for
Want more and more, people just want more and more
Freedom and love, what he's looking for

Freed from desire, mind and senses purified
Freed from desire

[Chorus]
Nanananana nana nanana nanana
Nanananana nana nanana nana
Nanananana nana nanana nanana
Nanananana nana nanana nana
