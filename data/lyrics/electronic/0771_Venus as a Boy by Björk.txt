His wicked sense of humour
Suggests exciting sex
His fingers, they focus on her
Touches, he's Venus as a boy
[Bridge]
[Gibberish]

[Chorus]
He believes in a beauty
He's Venus as a boy
He believes in a beauty
He believes in a beauty
He's Venus as a boy
He believes in a beauty

[Verse 2]
He's exploring the taste of her
Arousal, so accurate
He sets off the beauty in her
He's Venus, Venus as a boy
[Bridge]
