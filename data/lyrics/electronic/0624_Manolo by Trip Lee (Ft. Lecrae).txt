[Hook: GAWVI]
I do it for the turn-up (Yeah, yeah!)
Got that ammo locked and loaded (Buck-buck, brrt!)
I ain't talking bout no burner (Ooh, ooh, ooh!)
Flip a page, I'll explode it
Got a cabin in manolo (Nolo), manolo (Nolo)
Manolo (Nolo), manolo
Got a cabin in manolo (Nolo), manolo (Nolo)
Manolo (Nolo) manolo
Got a cabin in manolo

[Verse 1: Trip Lee]
Trying to tell them boys, I never leave the crib alone
'Cause I keep one in my car and I got two at home
They diff'rent kinds but they do the same thing
Double-edged double-barrel- bang, bang (Yessuh)
I’m out here facin' dragons, I ain’t out my mind (Bang, bang)
They comin' for my soul, so it’s 'bout that time (Bang, bang)
Them lies, they trying to kill me, if you don't believe me (Ugh)
I don't care, I don't care, I can't take it easy
I’m flippin' the page, I’m trigger-happy, a clip in the gauge (Brrat-brrat!)
Clickin' and hittin' the stage, hit you with truth that's in every phrase (Brrat-brrat!)
He cut me deep, I'm divin' in, divin' in (Yeah)
When I ride I gotta (Fly-fly), come alive again
Woo, that's right
(When I ride, I got to come-come alive again) You know we got it
(Come alive again) Uh huh (Come alive again), Manolo, mane
(When I-when I ride, I got to come-)

[Verse 2: Lecrae]
Yeah
Manolo, manolo, I’m out here going postal
My partnas think I lost it, my momma think I'm loco
I keep my shooter close, though, you know it's fully automatic (Bang!)
Shoot you straight, man that truth'll do you plenty damage, ugh
I got enemies, I can't see 'em all but they lurkin' (Lurkin', lurkin')
I flip that page on 'em, my trigger-finger stay workin (Pop-pop-pop!)
I got plenty ammo got old and new, they both testify (My Lord)
And ain't nobody playin' with you, gon' mess around, and come test the fire (Ugh)
And I ain't gotta say no more, I'm gonna click-click-bang and the thing gon' blow
Red Letters like a red dot on yo dome (Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep), all y'all gone
With a dash on the backseat, that's me with a clip full of black ink
I'ma hit y'all with it till I split y'all with it, man down, man down, had a bad week, bad week
[Bridge: Lecrae]
Man down, man down, man down, man down
Man down, man down, man down, had a bad week
Man down, man down, man down, man down
Man down, man down, man down, had a bad week

[Verse 3: Trip Lee]
I be- I be
I be a sheep, I'm a dummy, sometimes, it ain't even funny
Them lies are sicker than poison while the truth that is sweeter than honey
And we know that He got us, He is with us can't block us; Ibaka
And we fighting the lies 'cause His word is my weapon, it's going Brr-aat!
