And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I'd follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it, you just wanted me smaller
If you would've let me grow, you could've kept my love

[Verse 1]
Open up your eyes
There's nothing on my body left to see
I tried a thousand times
I tried to say "I love you", but you didn't hear me
And you're passive-aggressive
Convinced me other people they don't care about me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And you're passive-aggressive
You're passive-aggressive
You're passive-aggressive, hey

[Chorus]
And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I'd follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it, that you wanted me smaller
If you would've let me grow, you could've kept my love

[Verse 2]
Ode to my two thighs
I still want you to kiss 'em 'cause they're lonely
And why you so surprised
That when I said "I miss you", you never believed me?
And we were so depressive
You and me together, we were Gemini feed
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
And we were so depressive
We were so depressive
We were so depressive, hey

[Chorus]
And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I'd follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it, that you wanted me smaller
If you would've let me grow, you could've kept my love

[Bridge]
And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I'd follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it, that you wanted me smaller
If you would've let me grow, you could've kept my love

[Chorus]
And to think you would get me to the altar
Like I'd follow you around like a dog that needs water
But admit it, that you wanted me smaller
If you would've let me grow, you could've kept my love
