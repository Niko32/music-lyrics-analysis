I got two diamonds and a feather
Give me three reasons why we ain’t together
I push my body through the floor like
'Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else

[Verse 2]
You’re in the corner waiting for my love
I put two walls behind you just to lean on
You're gonna need 'em 'cause I stood you up
'Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else

[Chorus]
'Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else (It's all love)
I used to care what you think about me (It's all love)
'Cause my love so good
So I fuck with myself more than anybody else

[Verse 3]
I caught you fishing through the fodder
This whole relationship is underwater
You're facing ages in your third strike
'Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else

[Chorus]
'Cause I fuck with myself more than anybody else (It's all love)
I used to care what you think about me (It's all love)
'Cause my love so good
So I fuck with myself more than anybody else
You might also like[Bridge]
I used to have a nickel for what you say
Baby, your words would burn me in the third degree
Now, baby, look what it’s come to
'Cause my love is the one, my love is the one

[Chorus]
So I fuck with myself more than anybody else (It's all love)
I used to care what you think about me (It's all love)
'Cause my love so good
So I fuck with myself more than anybody else

[Outro]
I used to care what you think...
My love so good...
