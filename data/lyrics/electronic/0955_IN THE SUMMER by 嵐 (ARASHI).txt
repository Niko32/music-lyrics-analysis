[Verse 1]
Feet in the sand, cancel your plans
We only got one life, let's live it while we can
Don't be afraid, let's ride the wave
And if you fall, I promise I'ma keep you safe

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't let go, don't let go
Even when the seasons change
I won't let go, won't let go
Tell me that you feel the same

[Chorus]
Do you remember how I stayed awake
Watchin' the sun come up to light your face
In the summer, in the summer
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
Do you remember how I held you close
And I made sure you never got too cold
In the summer, in the summer
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
Keepin' our dreams and hopes up high
Baby, let's dance tonight
Reachin' up to the sky
Keepin' our hearts alive
In the summer, in the summer
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah

In the summer, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
見つめて 引き寄せる
Keep living in the moment that's what it's about
呼吸の音[ね]も too close
Life is beautiful キミとだから naked love then

[Pre-Chorus]
Always know (Oh-oh), always know (Yeah)
My feelings they won't ever fade
And even when the rain turns to snow
We will always be the same

[Chorus]
肌と肌 触れ million kisses
此れ以上ない a season's tale
In the summer, in the summer
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
二人 溶けて行く hottest temp
捉えようのない 愛しさへ
In the summer, in the summer
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
蒸発しそうな 雫を
冷ます この sea tide
何もかもが fine
酔いしれたい all times
In the summer, in the summer
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
[Drop]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
In the summer, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Right by your side
Yeah, you know that I ain't gonna leave
So keep your dreams and hopes forever
Sparks in your eyes and it hits me so hard
It's unreal 'cause we were meant to be together

[Chorus]
Do you remember how I stayed awake (Woo)
Watchin' the sun come up to light your face
In the summer (In the summer), in the summer (In the summer)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Do you remember how I held you close (Oh-oh-oh)
And I made sure you never got too cold
In the summer, in the summer (Ooh, ooh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
Keepin' our dreams and hopes up high
Baby, let's dance tonight
Reachin' up to the sky
Keepin' our hearts alive
In the summer, in the summer
Oh-oh, oh-oh, yeah
[Drop]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (Ooh)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
In the summer, oh-oh, oh-oh

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
In the summer, oh-oh, oh-o
