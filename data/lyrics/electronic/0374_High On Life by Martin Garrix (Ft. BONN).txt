Killed the demons of my mind
Ever since you came around
We're a river, running wild
How could I have been so blind?

[Pre-Chorus]
I just live a fast life
Forget about the past time
I numb out to escape my feels
And friendships only pass by
Show up, gone, like strobe lights
But with you, I feel something real

[Chorus]
And I'd walk a million miles, just to see you smile
'Til the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we get high on life
'Til the day we die

[Post-Chorus]
High on life 'til the day we die
High on life 'til the day we die
High on life 'til the day we die

[Pre-Drop]
And I'd walk a million miles, just to see you smile
'Til the day I die
You might also like[Drop]
High on life 'til the day we die

[Verse 2]
Through my fingers, out of sight
How could I have let you go?
Cutting corners, turning stones
But I can only see your ghost

[Pre-Chorus]
I just live a fast life
Forget about the past time
I numb out to escape my feels
And friendships only pass by
Show up, gone, like strobe lights
But with you, I feel something real

[Chorus]
And I'd walk a million miles, just to see you smile
'Til the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we get high on life
'Til the day we die

[Post-Chorus]
High on life 'til the day we die
[Pre-Drop]
Oh, I need you by my side, we get high on life
'Til the day we die

[Drop]
High on life 'til the day we die

[Outro]
And I'd walk a million miles, just to see you smile
'Til the day I die
Oh, I need you by my side, we get high on life
'Til the day we die
