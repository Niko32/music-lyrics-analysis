Take a dive into my eyes
Yeah, the eyes of a lioness
Feel the power, they ain't lying
A little look, a little touch
You know the power of silence
Yeah, keep it up, keep it up

[Pre-Chorus]
I was looking for some high-high-highs, yeah
'Til I got a dose of you, you got me pelican fly-fly-flyin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm way up and I ain't comin' down, keep taking me higher
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah, ah, yeah, yeah, ah, yeah, ah, yeah
'Cause I'm burning up and I ain't coolin' down, yeah, I got the fire
Ah, yeah, ah, yeah ah, yeah, yeah, ah, yeah, ah, yeah
