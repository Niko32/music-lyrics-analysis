If you really, really love me, then tell me
Say you can't live one day without me, really, really
Say you want me, that you're crazy about me really
If you really, really want me, then tell me
Say you'll never look at anyone else, really, really
Tell me you're not like the other guys, really

[Verse 1: Jisoo & Jennie]
Say you'll pick up the stars in the sky (Uh)
Be good when you have me, we don't have much time (Uh-huh)
Say that when you see the other girls, you don't care at all
Sometimes I want to hear these white lies
All the girls around you have nothing to offer
Stop talking to them, cut them off from your life
You will come to me anyway
Better act like you know, boy
Better act like you know, boy

[Verse 2: Lisa]
Eyes have been callin' me, baby
Body been tellin' me, "Take me"
Boys have been sayin' to date me
Your lips should be sayin' the same thing
For real, what's the deal?
Got a feelin' you feelin' me
Ay, but I don't play with them fakes
Keep it real with me

If you really, really love me, then tell me
Say you can't live one day without me, really, really
Say you want me, that you're crazy about me really
If you really, really want me, then tell me
Say you'll never look at anyone else, really, really
Tell me you're not like the other guys, really

[Verse 3: Rosé, Jisoo & Jennie]
If you kiss me once, I'll do it twice
I'll stop you if you cross the line, no, no
If both our eyes meet, haha, hehe, hoho
Lately I was lonely because of you, no more
When you drink, don't ignore my calls, yeah
Don't believe me when I say it's over, yeah
It's not complicated, as easy as one, two, three
Imagine how it'll be when we become one

[Verse 4: Lisa]
Want a romance like the old times
Want to slow dance when it's show time
Just me and you (Just me and you)
And that slow jam that we both like
That playlist, my favorite, so play it
But baby, F a love song
I need you to say it, say it
[Chorus: Jisoo & Rosé]
If you really, really love me, then tell me
Say you can't live one day without me, really, really
Say you want me, that you're crazy about me really
If you really, really want me, then tell me
Say you'll never look at anyone else, really, really
Tell me you're not like the other guys, really

[Outro: Lisa]
I gotta know that you're for real
Really, really, really
I gotta know that you're for real
Really, really, really
I gotta know that you're for real
Really, really, really
I gotta know that you're for real
Really, really, really
