Sometimes I wonder if you still wanna fuck me
Like you said on AIM in '08 (Totally)
Bible study, we were buddy-buddy
Then you said that we should fornicate (Like, yeah)
In my gross Ugg boots, in your scene-king suit
Let your white studded belt hit the ground
And my hair stay teased as I'm on my knees
Shut the Porta-Potty door and not a sound (Ah)

[Refrain]
And like every other shitty love story
You came and went, and just like that
And I tried to call you desperately
But boy, you didn't add me back, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, I know, I know whatever city you're in
You're still the boy that I'd pick in a lineup of, like thirty hot guys
Your eyes are so, so pretty I bet
Your lips are probably wet with the lies of our relationship

[Chorus]
Now it's fine because I'm a whore
And I sleep with guys just for fun and drugs, but
Sometimes I stay inside and wonder why
I thought we were cool, I thought we were cool
In vacation Bible school, Bible school, ooh
Vacation Bible school, Bible school, ooh (In vacation bible school)
Vacation Bible school, Bible school, ooh
Vacation Bible school, Bible school, ooh (In vacation bible school)
In vacation Bible school

Scoo-bi-doop-doo-doo, Jesus
Scoo-bi-doop-doo-doo, Jesus (Mmm, yeah)
Scoo-bi-doop-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo (Ah)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I wonder if Jesus is above me
Making sure we meet again (But when?)
And then when I saw you at our local mall, you
You walked right by me with your friends (What a dick, literally)
In my gross Ugg boots, in your scene-king suit
Let your white studded belt hit the ground
And my hair stay teased as I'm on my knees
Shut the Porta-Potty door and not a sound (Ah)

[Refrain]
And like every other shitty love story
You came and went, and just like that
And I tried to call you desperately
But boy, you didn't add me back, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, I know, I know whatever city you're in
You're still the boy that I'd pick in a lineup of, like thirty hot guys
Your eyes are so, so pretty I bet
Your lips are probably wet with the lies of our relationship
[Chorus]
Now it's fine because I'm a whore
And I sleep with guys just for fun and drugs, but
Sometimes I stay inside and wonder why
I thought we were cool, I thought we were cool
In vacation Bible school, Bible school, ooh
Vacation Bible school, Bible school, ooh (In vacation bible school)
In vacationâ€“

[Bridge]
And one day I get to blame myself for this
I can blame it on selfishness
That you never really wanted my love (Mmm, crapface)
And someday (Someday, someday), God will make you pay for this
I just wanted faithfulness
But you never really wanted my love (My love, my love)
(Or my backdoor)

[Pre-Chorus]
And baby, I know, I know whatever city you're in
You're still the boy that I'd pick in a lineup of, like thirty hot guys
Your eyes are so, so pretty I bet
Your lips are probably wet with the lies of our relationship

[Chorus]
Now it's fine because I'm a whore
And I sleep with guys just for fun and drugs, but
Sometimes I stay inside and wonder why
I thought we were cool, I thought we were cool
In vacation Bible school, Bible school, ooh
Vacation Bible school, Bible school, ooh (In vacation bible school)
Vacation Bible school, Bible school, ooh
Vacation Bible school, Bible school, ooh (In vacation bible school)
In vacation Bible school
[Outro]
