Boy, you make it look so easy
Promise that I'm gonna call you back in five
Sorry, baby girl, but I can't tonight, oh
Boy, you make it look so simple, mm
Yeah, I've known that girl for like my whole life
Back in my hotel and I'm alone inside, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you know the truth hurts, but secrets kill
Can't help thinkin' that I love it still
Still here, there must be something real
'Cause you know the good die young, but so did this
And so it must be better than I think it is
Gimme those eyes, it's easy to forgive

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh

You and all your friends all hate me, oh
Thinkin' that you're better when I'm not around
Hear me on the radio and turn it down, oh
I can't help the way you made me (Ah)
Hope that she believin' in the truth you found
Thinkin' that you want us 'cause I can't find out, oh (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you know the truth hurts, but secrets kill
Can't help thinkin' that I love it still
Still here, there must be something real
'Cause you know the good die young
But so did this, and so it must be better than I think it is
Gimme those eyes, it's easy to forgive

[Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh
I hope hopeless
Oh-ooh
Changes over time
Oh-ooh
And I hope hopeless
Oh-ooh
Changes over time
Oh-ooh
And I hope hopeless
Oh-ooh
Changes over time
