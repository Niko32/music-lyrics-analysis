And you say that I'm the devil you know
And I don't disagree, no, I don't see the harm
They say, "You crazy, just leave him, he'll suffocate you"
But I wanna be in your arms
They say, "No, don't pick up the phone"
"Let him think that nobody home"
But I'm under your spell
'Cause when you call, my heart starts to roll
I always want more
It's my heaven, my hell

[Pre-Chorus]
We're headin' deep, inside lives a voice, a voice so quiet
But I can't hear the voice when your heart beats next to mine

[Chorus]
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I know I'm gonna regret it

When you say, "Baby," I just want you to lay me down
And we'll fuck the pain away
'Cause skin on skin, I feel nothing but the burning of desire
And that's just foreplay

[Pre-Chorus]
We're headin' deep, inside lives a voice, a voice so quiet
But I can't hear the voice when your heart beats next to mine

[Chorus]
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I know I'm gonna regret it

[Outro]
I can't quit you
I can't quit you, oh, baby, yeah
I can't quit you
I can't quit you, oh, babe
Gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I'm gonna regret it, yeah, ayy
Gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
