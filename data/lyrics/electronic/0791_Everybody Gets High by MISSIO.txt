Once upon a time in a land far away
There lived a little boy and he drank all day
Friends called him stupid and his brothers called him gay
Emptied all the bottles 'til the pain went away

[Pre-Chorus]
Whiskey was his friend, he didn't have another
Vicodin his vice, his real and only lover (yup)
Smoked a pack or two, it never was a problem
Popped a pill or two, they really made him blossom (yup)

[Chorus]
Take a sip, take a sip, take a sip
And I trip, and I trip, and I trip
And I'm like... when you bitch, when you bitch, when you bitch
Counterfeit, hypocrite, holy shit

[Verse 2]
Once upon a time in a land far away
There lived a little boy and he cried all day
Playboy bunny magazines would never get him laid
Downed another bottle 'til the pain went away

[Pre-Chorus]
Whiskey was his friend, he didn't have another
Vicodin his vice, his real and only lover (yup)
Smoked a pack or two, it never was a problem
Popped a pill or two, they really made him blossom (yup)

Take a sip, take a sip, take a sip
And I trip, and I trip, and I trip
And I'm like... when you bitch, when you bitch, when you bitch
Counterfeit, hypocrite, holy shit
Take a sip, take a sip, take a sip
And I trip, and I trip, and I trip
And I'm like... when you bitch, when you bitch, when you bitch
Counterfeit, hypocrite, holy shit

[Bridge]
Everybody gets high
All I ever get is high
Everybody gets high
All I ever get is high
Everybody gets high
All I ever get is high
Everybody gets high
All I ever get is high
(Yup)

[Chorus]
Take a sip, take a sip, take a sip
And I trip, and I trip, and I trip
And I'm like... when you bitch, when you bitch, when you bitch
Counterfeit, hypocrite holy shit
[Bridge]
Everybody gets high
All I ever get is high
Everybody gets high
All I ever get is high
Everybody gets high
All I ever get is high
Everybody gets high
All I ever get is high
