Heart been so cold that I don't feel at all
Scarred up inside, so I built all these walls
My head rollin' back, but I'm fakin' the rush
Out every night and I'm lonely as fuck

[Pre-Chorus]
I make my own rules and my own plans
I got no room for no man
That's my way
That's my way
Then I saw you in a dream, right
I wanna call you, a kind of feelin'
I can't name
I can't name

[Chorus]
It's strange
But I don't need space from you
And every single thing you do, I like
I've been chased
Maybe I just knew I had to wait for you
Draw a knife and carve a little space for you
It feels nice

[Drop]
It's strange
But I don't need space from you
And every single thing you do, I like
You might also like[Verse 2]
Opened me up, I let down my defense
I swore that I wouldn't go fallin' again
I could be faded with somebody new
Rather be sober at home, just us two

[Pre-Chorus]
I make my own rules and my own plans
I got no room for no man
That's my way
That's my way
Then I saw you in a dream, right
I wanna call you, a kind of feelin'
I can't name
I can't name

[Chorus]
It's strange
But I don't need space from you
And every single thing you do, I like
I've been chased
Maybe I just knew I had to wait for you
Draw a knife and carve a little space for you
It feels nice

[Drop]
I make my own rules and my own plans
I got no room for no man
That's my way
That's my way
Then I saw you in a dream, right
I wanna call you, a kind of feelin'
I can't name
I can't name
