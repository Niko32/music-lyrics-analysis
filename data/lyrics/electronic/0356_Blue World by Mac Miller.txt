It's a blue world without you
It's a blue world alone

[Chorus]
Yeah, well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mm, don't trip
We don't gotta let him in, don't trip
Yeah, yeah
I let it go, but I never go with it, mm

[Verse 1]
Yeah, okay, cool as fall weather, fuck the bullshit
I'm here to make it all better with a little music for you
I don't do enough for you
Without you, it's the color blue
Ooh, don't trip
I was in the city, they was talkin' that shit
Had the homies with me, all the sudden, they split
We ain't even worried, we just laughin', that's rich
You know how it goes, it ain't broke, don't fix

[Refrain]
Hey, one of these days, we'll all get by
Don't be afraid, don't fall
You might also like[Verse 2]
Think I lost my mind, reality's so hard to find
When the devil tryna call your line, but shit, I always shine
Even when the light dim
No, I ain't God, but I'm feelin' just like Him
Ooh, don't trip
See, I was in the whip, ridin', me and my bitch
We was listenin' to us, no one else, that's it
That's a flex, just a bit, let me talk my shit
Say my head got big

[Chorus]
Yeah, well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mm, don't trip
We don't gotta let him in, don't trip
Yeah, yeah
I let it go, but I never go with it, mm

[Post-Chorus]
Don't trip
Don't trip
Don't trip
[Bridge]
Well, if you could see me now
Love me and hold me down
My mind, it goes, it goes
It goes, it goes, it goes

[Chorus]
Well, this a mad world, it made me crazy
Might just turn around, do one-eighty
I ain't politickin', I ain't kissin' no babies
The devil on my doorstep bein' so shady
Mm, don't trip
We don't gotta let him in, don't trip
Yeah, yeah
I let it go, but I never go with it, mm

[Outro]
Hey, one of these days, we'll all get by
Don't be afraid, don't fall in line
