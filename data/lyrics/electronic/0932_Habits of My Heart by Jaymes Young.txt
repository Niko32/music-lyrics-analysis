I can't, say no
It's ripping me apart

[Verse 1]
In a dark room, in cold sheets
I can't feel a damn thing
I lost myself between your legs
Your medicine is in my head

[Pre-Chorus]
You know I'd rather be alone, yeah
But then you call me on the phone

[Chorus]
Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go

[Verse 2]
I tell myself "I like that"
When you tie my hands behind my back
You're confident, I'll give you that
But if you love yourself, you can fuck yourself
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'd rather be alone
But you fermented in my bones

[Chorus]
Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go
Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close
You make it hard to let you go
Oh, the habits of my heart
I can't say no
It's ripping me apart
You get too close...
