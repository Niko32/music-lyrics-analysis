Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
You'll always be my day one
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my day one
Thankful you're my

[Verse 1]
I got lucky finding you
I won big the day that I came across you
'Cause when you're with me, I don't feel blue
Not a day goes by that I would not redo

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wants to love (Yeah, that's right)
It's easy when you try hard enough
Yeah, that's right

[Chorus]
You'll always be my day one
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my day one
I'm thankful you're my day one
You might also like[Verse 2]
When I first met you, it just felt right
It's like I met a copy of myself that night
I don't believe in fate as such
But we were meant to be together, that's my hunch

[Pre-Chorus]
Everybody wants true love
It's out there if you look hard enough
Enough, enough

[Chorus]
You'll always be my day one
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my day one

[Bridge]
Hour by hour, minute by minute
I got mad love for you and you know it
I would never leave you on your own
I just want you to know

[Chorus]
You'll always be my day one (Day one)
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my day one (Thankful you're my day one)
You'll always be my day one
Day zero when I was no one
I'm nothing by myself, you and no one else
Thankful you're my day one (Day one)
[Outro]
Day one (Day one)
Day one (Day one)
Thankful you're my day one (Day one)
Thankful you're my day one (Day one)
