Oh honey, I'll do anything for you
Oh honey, just tell me what you want me to
Oh honey, kiss me up against the wall
Oh honey, don't take anything, just have it all

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I can take it, so don't you fake it
I know your love's my destiny
Yeah, I can take it, please demonstrate it
'Cause I'm going down in history

[Chorus]
Hey, yeah, whoa-ho, I'm on a roll
Ridin' so high, achieving my goals
Hey, yeah, whoa-ho, I'm on a roll
Ridin' so high, achieving my goals

[Post-Chorus]
I'm stoked on ambition and verve
I'm gonna get what I deserve
So full of ambition and verve
I'm gonna get what I deserve

[Verse 2]
Oh honey, let's get in through the door
Oh honey, not concerned who sees us ripping up the floor
Oh honey, we'll go dancing wherever you choose
Oh honey, you know we just can't lose
