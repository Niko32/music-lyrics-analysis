Temperature risin', bodies united
Now that I trapped you in my arms
No need to fight it, no need to hide it
Now that I've seen what's in your heart
Baby girl, I'm the only one who knows this side of you
And baby, you know that I can pull out what's inside of you

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Even though it's wrong
It's wrong
Even though it's wrong, baby
My girl
Oh-ooh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh-oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh-ooh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh-oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
You want me inside it, beg me to slide in
Knowing we should have never met
Girl, when you ride it, see you decide it
Don't say those words that you'll regret
Baby girl, I can tell that you think that I'm right for you
I already know that it's not true, but girl, I'll lie to you

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Even though it's wrong (Yeah, yeah)
It's wrong (Yeah, yeah)
Even though it's wrong, baby (Yeah, yeah)
My girl (Yeah)
Oh-ooh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh-oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh-ooh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, oh-oh (Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

We do the things, but we know it's wrong
All on my skin, you all in my palm
I sent you an envelope, came with a poem
You possess venom, that came with a charm
You get the good out me when I perform
I know the bad in you, that's what I want
And you a baddie, you turnin' me on
Fiend for your demons, I know where this goin'
Love when you fuckin' me, talkin', I know what you doin'
Caught up in love, what the fuck is we doin'?
Models and bottles with us, ain't nothin' to it
I tell you, "I got you," that's well understood
Your legs on the bed, got your head on the floor
We go out shoppin' whenever we get bored
We get it poppin', leave nothin' in the store
If I go to Saturn, I know that you goin'
Fuck me on Saturday, early in the mornin'
Flyer than a bird, she gon' open her door
Screamin' out murder, but showin' you remorse
Gotta be cautious, can't pay the support
Stars in the ceilin', don't feel like a Porsche
Came from the trenches, just livin' at war
Once was a prostitute, I can afford you
The one I adore
[Pre-Chorus: The Weeknd]
Temperature risin', bodies united
Now that I trapped you in my arms
No need to fight it, no need to hide it
Now that I've seen what's in your heart
Baby girl, I'm the only one who knows this side of you
And baby, you know that I can pull out what's inside of you

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
Even though it's wrong
It's wrong
Even though it's wrong, baby
My girl
