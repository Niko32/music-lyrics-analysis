If you must wait
Wait for them here in my arms as I shake
If you must weep
Do it right here in my bed as I sleep
If you must mourn my love
Mourn with the moon and the stars up above
If you must mourn, don't do it alone
If you must leave
Leave as though fire burns under your feet
If you must speak
Speak every word as though it were unique
If you must die, sweetheart
Die knowing your life was my life's best part
If you must die
Remember your life

[Bridge]
You are
You are all
You are
You are all

[Verse 2]
If you must fight
Fight with yourself and your thoughts in the night
If you must work
Work to leave some part of you on this earth
If you must live, darling one
Just live
Just live
Just liveYou might also like
