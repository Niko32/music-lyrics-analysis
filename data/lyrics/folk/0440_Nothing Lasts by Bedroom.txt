I pray to God
To stop these thoughts
It works for me
Can't you see?
I know that I'm better
I'm writing this letter
To my past self
Sitting on the shelf

[Verse 2]
Nothing lasts
It's for the best
I won't stay here
I won't stay there
'Cause now I'm happy
For You have changed me
I am so thankful
No longer painfulYou might also like
