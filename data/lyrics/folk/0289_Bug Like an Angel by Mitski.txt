There's a bug like an angel stuck to the bottom
Of my glass, with a little bit left
As I got older, I learned I'm a drinker
Sometimes, a drink feels like family

[Chorus: Mitski & Choir]
Family

[Verse 2: Mitski]
Hey, what's the matter? Lookin' like your sticker
Is stuck on a floor somewhere
Did you go and make promises you can't keep?
Well, when ya break them, they break you right back
Amateur mistake, you can take it from me

[Chorus: Mitski & Choir]
They break you right back
Break you right back

[Post-Chorus: Mitski & Choir]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 3: Mitski]
When I'm bent over wishin' it was over
Makin' all variety of vows I'll never keep
I try to remember the wrath of the devil
Was also given him by God

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
