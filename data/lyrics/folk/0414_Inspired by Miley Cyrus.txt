I'm writing down my dreams, all I'd like to see
Starting with the bees or else they're gonna die
There will be no trees or air for us to breathe
I start feeling mad, but then I feel inspired
Thinkin' about the days
Coming home with dirty feet from playing with my dad
All day in the creek
He somehow has a way of knowing what to say
So when I'm feeling sad, he makes me feel inspired

[Chorus]
We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
To think we are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up the change
I know that sounds so strange
Because you always felt so small, but know you aren't at all
And I hope you feel inspired
Oh, I hope you feel inspired

[Bridge]
How can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?
Death is life, it's not a curse
Reminds us of time and what it's worth
To make the most out of it while we're here
You might also like[Chorus]
We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
We are meant for more
There's a lock upon the door, but we hold the key to change

[Outro]
But how can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?
