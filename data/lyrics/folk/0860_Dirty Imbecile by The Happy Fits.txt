If I’m so smart and I’m so pretty, damn this town and damn this city
You never give me anything that I want
No one seems to really care; they're just wholly unaware
Of all the blood and sweat I cry before dawn

[Pre-Chorus]
But you won’t understand all the things that I am
'Cause I’m crazy in just too many ways
But I get that little feel when my heart starts beating
Lungs stop breathing, all my fibers say to run away

[Chorus 1]
Count my little scars, I’ve got dozens down inside
I come complete and invincible behind my dirty imbecile
All these things I’ve tried, boy: Be cute, be dumb, be wise, be young
So don’t tell me what to fear in the darkness of this atmosphere

[Verse 2]
Love my mum and love my daddy; sure, they messed me up but that is
Voices that they left inside of my head
Darling, dearest, don’t you see? I’m tough, I’m smart, I’m bourgeoisie
And I’ll play out this lie until we’re all dead

[Pre-Chorus]
But you won’t understand all the things that I am
'Cause I’m crazy in just too many ways
But I get that little feel when my heart starts beating
Lungs stop breathing, all my fibers say to run away
You might also like[Chorus 1]
Count my little scars, I’ve got dozens down inside
I come complete and invincible behind my dirty imbecile
All these things I’ve tried, boy: Be cute, be dumb, be wise, be young
So don’t tell me what to fear in the darkness of this atmosphere

[Bridge]
Am I good? Is all I could enough for you?
I’m so scared of when and where I’ll find the truth

[Chorus 2]
Count my little scars, I’ve got dozens down inside
I come complete and invincible behind my dirty imbecile
(Am I good? Is all I could enough for you?)
All these things I’ve tried, boy: Be cute, be dumb, be wise, be young
So don’t tell me what to fear in the darkness of this atmosphere
(I’m so scared of when and where I’ll find the truth)

[Chorus 2]
Count my little scars, I’ve got dozens down inside
I come complete and invincible behind my dirty imbecile
(Am I good? Is all I could enough for you?)
All these things I’ve tried, boy: Be cute, be dumb, be wise, be young
So don’t tell me what to fear in the darkness of this atmosphere
(I’m so scared of when and where I’ll find the truth)
[Chorus 2]
Count my little scars, I’ve got dozens down inside
I come complete and invincible behind my dirty imbecile
(Am I good? Is all I could enough for you?)
All these things I’ve tried, boy: Be cute, be dumb, be wise, be young
So don’t tell me what to fear in the darkness of this atmosphere
(I’m so scared of when and where I’ll find the truth)
