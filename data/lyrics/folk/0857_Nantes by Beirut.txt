Well it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
And I'll gamble away my fright
And I'll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile

[Chorus: Zach Condon]
Nobody raise your voices
Just another night in Nantes
Nobody raise your voices
Just another night in Nantes
[Bridge: Simone Simon & Fernand Ledoux]
...plaisanter
Oh non je t'en prie, nous ne sommes pas chez nous
Oh je t'assure que Victoire...
Non, laisse moi!
Mais qu'est-ce que tu as aujourd'hui?
J'ai que les hommes me dégoûtent, vous ne pensez qu'à ça

[Verse: Zach Condon]
Well it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
And I'll gamble away my fright
And I'll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smileYou might also like
