My breakfast is straight out the medicine cabinet
A remedy for the aftermath of my habits
Sometimes it's the ones who try to help
That hurt the most
I feel like we're playing tug of war, and I'm the rope
And I'm stretched to the limit, but you keep on pulling
And I'm gonna lose my goddamn mind
I'm gonna lose my mind

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Jesse Sendejas & Whitney Flynn]
I want to hide away in the back of a cave
At the top of a mountain where no one can hear me
And no one can see me so I don't have to deal with them
And they don't have to deal with me
'Cause relationships are overrated
Maybe I'm just tired and jaded
But I'm sorry I just like myself more than I like you

[Refrain]
So call me anti-social, call it masturbation
Either way, it's a solo operation
I'm just far more comfortable alone

[Verse 3: Jesse Sendejas & Whitney Flynn]
It appears that apathy has gotten the best of me
'Cause I'm so tired of you talking my ear off about all your problems I just can't fix
I don't appreciate this unwanted company
And your constant chatter reminds me why I'd rather you leave me be

[Refrain]
So call me anti-social, call it masturbation
Either way, it's a solo operation
I'm just far more comfortable alone

[Chorus]
'Cause people are ugly, and people are hateful
Destructive and greedy, we're proud and ungrateful
The world would be so much better off without us

So swallow a bullet or a handful of pills
We're all compost in training, and there's graves left to fill
Distract ourselves to make us feel like we're not just mistakes
Distract ourselves to make us feel like we're not just mistakes

[Bridge]
It seems that everybody always has a bone to pick
A promise to break
Never again will I make that mistake
Of trusting anyone (Trusting anyone)
Trusting anyone
This is my misanthropic confession
Human beings are a waste of breath and
Don't think I exclude myself
I'm an asshole just like you

[Chorus]
'Cause people are ugly, and people are hateful
Destructive and greedy, we're proud and ungrateful
The world would be so much better off without us

So swallow a bullet or a handful of pills
We're all compost in training, and there's graves left to fill
Distract ourselves to make us feel like we're not just mistakes
Distract ourselves to make us feel like we're not just mistakes

[Outro]
