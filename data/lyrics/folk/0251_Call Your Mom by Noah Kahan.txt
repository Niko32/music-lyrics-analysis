Oh, you're spiralin' again
The moment right before it ends you're most afraid of
But don't you cancel any plans
'Cause I won't let you get the chance to never make them

[Pre-Chorus]
Stayed on the line with you the entire night
'Til you let it out and let it in

[Chorus]
Don't let this darkness fool you
All lights turned off can be turned on
I'll drive, I'll drive all night
I'll call your mom
Oh, dear, don't be discouraged
I've been exactly where you are
I'll drive, I'll drive all night
I'll call your mom
I'll call your mom

[Verse 2]
Waiting room, no placе to stand
Just greatest fears and wringing hands and thе loudest silence
If you could see yourself like this
If you could see yourself like this, you'd've never tried it
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Stayed on the line with you the entire night
'Til you told me that you had to go

[Chorus]
Don't let this darkness fool you
All lights turned off can be turned on
I'll drive, I'll drive all night
I'll call your mom
Oh, dear, don't be discouraged
I've been exactly where you are
I'll drive, I'll drive all night
I'll call your mom

[Bridge]
Medicate, meditate, swear your soul to Jesus
Throw a punch, fall in love, give yourself a reason
Don't wanna drive another mile wonderin' if you're breathin'
So won't you stay, won't you stay, won't you stay with me?
Medicate, meditate, save your soul for Jesus
Throw a punch, fall in love, give yourself a reason
Don't wanna drive another mile without knowin' you're breathin'
So won't you stay, won't you stay, won't you stay with me?

[Chorus]
Don't let this darkness fool you
All lights turned off can be turned on
I'll drive, I'll drive all night
I'll call your mom
Oh, dear, don't be discouraged
I've been exactly where you are
I'll drive, I'll drive all night
I'll call your mom
I'll call your mom
