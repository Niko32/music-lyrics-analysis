I have seen
Seen it all in paper dreams
I watched it unfold on the screen
But I never understood
I have heard
Have heard you speak a million words
Now you're talkin' to me first
I never thought you would

[Chorus: Niall Horan & Maren Morris]
Oh, my, my, you just took me by surprise
And I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no, I, you're too good to be all mine
Now I'm lookin' in your eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind

[Verse 2: Maren Morris, Niall Horan & Maren Morris]
I was young
My heart was always on the run
But you make lovin' fun
I never knew it could be
Hey, I see you
From a different point of view
Feels too good to be true
I found my missin' piece
You might also like[Chorus: Niall Horan & Maren Morris]
Oh, my, my, you just took me by surprise
And I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no, I, you're too good to be all mine
Now I'm lookin' in your eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind

[Post-Chorus: Niall Horan & Maren Morris]
Oh, no

[Bridge: Niall Horan & Maren Morris]
Oh, my, my, when I look into your eyes
It's a sight I can't describe
Oh, I must be seein' blind

[Chorus: Niall Horan & Maren Morris]
Oh, my, my, you just took me by surprise
And I can't believe my eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind
Oh, no, I, you're too good to be all mine
Now I'm lookin' in your eyes
Oh, I must be seein' blind

[Outro: Niall Horan & Maren Morris]
Oh, I must be seein' blind
