Eurydice?

[HERMES, spoken]
Hey, the big artiste!
Ain't you working on your masterpiece?

[ORPHEUS, spoken]
Where is she?

[HERMES, spoken]
Brother, what do you care?
You'll find another muse somewhere

[ORPHEUS, spoken]
Where is she?

[HERMES, spoken]
Why do you wanna know?

[ORPHEUS]
Wherever she is, is where I'll go

[HERMES, spoken]
What if I said she's down below?
You might also like[ORPHEUS, spoken]
Down below?

[HERMES, spoken]
Down below
Six-feet-under-the-ground below
She called your name before she went
But I guess you weren't listening

[ORPHEUS, spoken]
No...

[HEREMES, spoken]
So...
Just how far would you go for her?

[ORPHEUS]
To the end of time
To the end of the earth

[HERMES, spoken]
You got a ticket?

[ORPHEUS, spoken]
No...?
[HERMES, spoken]
Yeah, I didn't think so
'Course, there is another way, but
I ain't supposed to say it

[ORPHEUS, spoken]
Another way?

[HERMES, spoken]
Yeah, around the back
But that ain't easy walkin', Jack
It ain't for the sensitive of soul, so...
You really wanna go?

[ORPHEUS, spoken]
With all my heart

[HERMES, spoken]
Huh, with all your heart...
Well, that's a start

[HERMES, muffled]
How to get to Hadestown:
You’ll have to take the long way down
Through the underground, under cover of night
Laying low, staying out of sight
There ain’t no compass, brother, ain’t no map
Just a telephone wire and the railroad track
You keep on walking and you don’t look back
’Til you get to the bottomland
[ORPHEUS]
Wait for me, I’m coming
Wait, I’m coming with you
Wait for me, I’m coming too
I’m coming too

[HERMES, muffled]
The River Styx is high and wide
Cinder bricks and razor wire
Walls of iron and concrete
Hound dogs howling 'round the gate
Them dogs’ll lay down and play dead
If you got the bones, if you got the bread
But if all you got is your own two legs
You best be glad you got ’em

[ORPHEUS and FATES]
Wait for me, I’m coming
Wait, I’m coming with you
Wait for me, I’m coming too
I’m coming too

[HERMES]
You’re on the lam, you’re on the run
Don’t give your name, you don’t have one
And don’t look no one in the eye
This town will try to suck you dry
They’ll suck your brain, they’ll suck your breath
They’ll pluck the heart right out your chest
They’ll truss you up in your Sunday best
And stuff your mouth with cotton

[ORPHEUS and COMPANY]
Wait for me, I’m coming
Wait, I’m coming with you
Wait for me, I’m coming too
I’m coming!
Wait
Wait
Wait
Wait...
