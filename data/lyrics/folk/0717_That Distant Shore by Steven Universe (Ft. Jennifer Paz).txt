It all became so lovely
Those bluest skies above me
Those funny feelings I had never felt before I met you
I thought I'd stay a while
I tried to learn to smile
So many colors I had never even known

[Refrain 1]
Maybe I'll find myself sitting on that distant shore
Maybe I'm not alone

[Verse 2]
Then I see the colors fading
Gentleness of light escaping
Shadows of my fear invading, have I seen this all before?
I know that there's something residing
A terror deep inside me
I couldn't understand how you could be so bold

[Refrain 2]
Maybe I'll find myself smiling on that distant shore
Maybe I'm not aloneYou might also like
