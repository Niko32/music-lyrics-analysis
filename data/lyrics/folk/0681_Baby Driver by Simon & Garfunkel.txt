My daddy was the family bassman
My mamma was an engineer
And I was born one dark gray morn
With music coming in my ears
In my ears

[Chorus]
They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel
(Rmm-ba-ba-ba)
Scoot down the road
What's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel
Shine the light

[Interlude]
Woo-uhh-uhh, woo-uhh-uhh, woo-uhh-uhh-do-do-do-do-do-dodoee, wee-dee-de-doee

[Verse 2]
My daddy was a prominent frogman
My mama's in the Naval reserve
When I was young I carried a gun
But I never got the chance to serve
I did not serve
You might also like[Chorus]
They call me Baby Driver
And once upon a pair of wheels
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel
(Rmm-ba-ba-ba)
Scoot down the road
What's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel

[Saxophone Solo]

[Interlude 2]
Baa-baa-baa-baa-baa-baa-aaa
Rmm-ba-ba-ba

[Verse 3]
My daddy got a big promotion
My mamma got a raise in pay
There's no-one home, we're all alone
Oh, come into my room and play
Yes, we can play

[Chorus]
I'm not talking about your pigtails
But I'm talking 'bout your sex appeal
I hit the road and I'm gone
What's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel
(Rmm-ba-ba-ba)
Scoot down the road
What's my number?
I wonder how your engines feel
[Outro]
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
