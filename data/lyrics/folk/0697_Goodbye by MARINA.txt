Heaven, if there's a star for us
Up there in your lover's universe
Shine your light down on me
Somewhere between new and old
Another life waits to unfold
Maybe one day, if we're lucky

[Pre-Chorus]
I fucked it up, I lost it all
And my life might not be what I thought
But I wouldn't change a thing
Goodbye to the girl that I'd been

[Chorus]
Goodbye to the girl that I was
Goodbye to the girl that you lost
I will never be yours again
Never wanted our love to end
Goodbye, my friend

[Verse 2]
Maybе we won't meet again
But you'll always be my closest friеnd
I hope you'll always be happy
Some mistakes are hard to learn
And broken hearts are quick to burn
And slow to heal easily
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I've been a mother to everyone else
To every motherfucker except myself
And I don't even have any kids
Goodbye to the girl that I'd been

[Chorus]
Goodbye to the girl that I was
Goodbye to the girl that you lost
I will never be yours again
Never wanted our love to end
Goodbye, my friend
Goodbye

[Bridge]
No matter what happens now
Nobody can take our love down
It's safe inside our memories
And I won't forget how you healed me

[Chorus]
Goodbye
Goodbye
I will never be yours again
Never wanted our love to end
Goodbye, my friend
It's time
I will never be yours again
Never wanted our love to end
Goodbye, my friend
[Outro]
My friend, friend, mm-mm-mm
My friend, friend, mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm, mm-mm-mm
