Poison oak, some boyhood bravery
When our telephone was a tin can on a string
And I fell asleep with you still talking to me

[Pre-Chorus]
You said you weren't afraid to die

[Verse 2]
In polaroids, you were dressed in women's clothes
Were you made ashamed, why'd you lock them in a drawer?
Well, I don't think that I ever loved you more

[Chorus 1]
Than when you turned away, when you slammed the door
When you stole a car and drove towards Mexico
And you wrote bad checks just to fill your arm
I was young enough, I still believed in war

[Verse 3]
Well, let the poets cry themselves to sleep
And all their tearful words would turn back into steam

[Chorus 2]
But me, I'm a single cell, on a serpent's tongue
There's a muddy field where a garden was
And I'm glad you got away, but I'm still stuck out here
My clothes are soaking wet from your brother's tears
You might also like[Bridge]
And I never thought this life was possible
You're the yellow bird that I've been waiting for

[Chorus 3]
The end of paralysis, I was a statuette
Now I'm drunk as hell on a piano bench
And when I press the keys it all gets reversed
The sound of loneliness makes me happier
