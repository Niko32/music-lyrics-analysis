Years, days, makes no difference to me, babe
You look exactly the same to me
Ain’t no time, crossing your legs inside the diner
Raising your coffee to your lips, the steam

[Chorus]
You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

[Verse 2]
You whisper to a restless ear, “Can you get me out of here?
This place smells like piss and beer, can you get me out?”
You were asking me how to get you free
I only know the recipe to roam

[Chorus]
You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping her left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

[Verse 3]
Old stars filling up my throat
You gave 'em to me when I was born, now they’re coming out
Laying there on the hospital bed, eyes were narrow, blue and red
You took a draw of breath and said to me
You might also like[Chorus]
You saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like me
Wrapping my left arm around your right
Ready to walk you through the night

[Verse 4]
Old friends, old mothers, dogs and brothers
There’s only so much letting go you can ask someone to do
So I keep you by my side, I will not give you to the tide
I'll even walk you in my stride, Marie

[Chorus]
'Cause I saw the masterpiece, she looks a lot like you
Wrapping your left arm around my right
Ready to walk me through the night
