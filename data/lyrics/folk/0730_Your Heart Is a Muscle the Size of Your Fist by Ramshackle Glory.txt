Dalia never showed me nothing but kindness
She would say: “I know how sad you get"
And some days, I still get that way
But it gets better, it gets better, it gets better
Sweetie, it gets better, I promise you
And she'd tell me...

[Chorus]
Your heart is a muscle the size of your fist
Keep on loving, keep on fighting
And hold on, and hold on
Hold on for your life

[Verse 2]
Ian built a cabin in the woods to live in
For years, terrifying noises kept him up at night
With a twelve gauge under his pillow
He’s living in Boston now, going to art school
I forgive him, I forgive him
Hell, I’ll admit it: I’m proud of him

Serena’s an architect and a carpenter
She’s such a feminist she says she isn’t one
'Cause, "Goddamn, my gender shouldn’t matter!"
And her motorcycle glides through the streets of Providence
Down to the warehouse district, the paint job is as stunning as
Her knowledge of medieval building techniques
You might also like[Chorus]
Your heart is a muscle the size of your fist
Keep on loving, keep on fighting
And hold on, and hold on
Hold on for your life

[Bridge]
This one goes out to Georgios, he knows how to dance
Abby Banks, your book is beautiful
And fuck anyone who says otherwise
Scott, I love you and you make me glad to be alive
I promise that I’m gonna pay you back
You always know how funny everything is
Even when I’m so serious that it’s gonna be the death of me

Like the time that our friend Chuck came over to our house
He said he needed somebody to take care of his pets
'Cause he was going out of town
I asked him, “Where,” and he said “New Mexico”
I asked if I could get a ride
He said: “No, you don’t want to follow me
Where it is I’m going”
He backed out of the driveway
That was the last time we saw him
'Cause he drove straight to his parent’s cabin
And put a bullet in his head
[Chorus]
Your heart is a muscle the size of your fist
Keep on loving, keep on fighting
And hold on, and hold on
Hold on for your life...
Your heart is a muscle the size of your fist
Keep on loving, keep on fighting
And hold on, and hold on
Hold on for your life
