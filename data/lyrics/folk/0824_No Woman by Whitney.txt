I left drinking on the city train
To spend some time on the road
Then one morning I woke up in LA
Caught my breath on the coast
I've been going through a change
I might never be sure
I'm just walking in a haze
I'm not ready to turn

[Chorus]
No woman
No woman

[Verse 2]
Midnight driving through the bay
Going back on the road
Coming up and I wish I could stay
I've been sleeping alone
I've been going through a change
I might never be sure
I'm just walking in a haze
I'm not ready to turn

[Chorus]
No woman
No woman
You might also like[Outro]
I left drinking on the city train
To spend some time on the road
