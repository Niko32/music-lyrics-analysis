I, I've been keeping secrets from you, dear
There's things in me I'm scared that you might fear
It crackles in the ground
And you, you've been coming closer to the edge
Wondering what goes on in my head
And so I shut you out

[Pre-Chorus: Victor Thell & Maria Jane Smith]
And I guess that we don't mean to be falling apart
But you will always have a special place in my heart
I never wanted this to end
Can you forgive me, friend?

[Chorus: Victor Thell & Maria Jane Smith]
'Cause I fell in the hole, in the hole, in the hole
My heart was turning cold, turning cold, turning cold
I never wanted this to end
Can you forgive me, friend?

[Verse 2: Maria Jane Smith]
And I, I promised you that we would never change
That you and me would always stay the same
How I let you down

[Pre-Chorus: Victor Thell & Maria Jane Smith]
And I guess that we don't mean to be falling apart
But you will always have a special place in my heart
I never wanted this to end
Can you forgive me, friend?

'Cause I fell in the hole, in the hole, in the hole
My heart was turning cold, turning cold, turning cold
I never wanted this to end
Can you forgive me, friend? (Hey)

[Bridge: Victor Thell & Maria Jane Smith]
So can
Can you forgive me, friend?
Can you forgive me, friend, for breaking us apart?
'Cause in the end
I didn't want this to end
Can you forgive me, friend? Forgive my ugly heart

[Pre-Chorus: Victor Thell & Maria Jane Smith]
And I guess that we don't mean to be falling apart
But you will always have a special place in my heart
I never wanted this to end
Can you forgive me, friend?

[Chorus: Victor Thell & Maria Jane Smith]
'Cause I fell in the hole, in the hole, in the hole
My heart was turning cold, turning cold, turning cold
I never wanted this to end
Can you forgive me, friend?
