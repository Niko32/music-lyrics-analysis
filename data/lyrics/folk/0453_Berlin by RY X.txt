Ooh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Come down, love
Berlin in the cold
All that fighting, all that snow

[Verse 2]
Sober nights
And Byron on my mind
Tell me I'm not going home
And I'll stop waiting by the phone

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Ooh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh
Ooh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-ooh, oh-ooh

[Verse 3]
Bedroom floor
And silence in my blood
Sorry, love, I'm running home
I'm a child of sun and the stars I loveYou might also like
