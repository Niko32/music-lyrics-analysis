It's a damn tough life, full of toil and strife, we whalermen undergo
And we don't give a damn when the gale is done, how hard the winds did blow
'Cause we're homeward bound from the Arctic ground with a good ship, taut and free
And we won't give a damn when we drink our rum with the girls of Old Maui

[Chorus]
Rolling down to Old Maui, me boys, rolling down to Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic Ground
Rolling down to Old Maui

[Verse 2]
Once more we sail with the northerly gale through the ice and wind and rain
Them coconut fronds, them tropical lands, we soon shall see again
Six hellish months we've passed away on the cold Kamchatka sea
But now we're bound from the Arctic Ground, rolling down to Old Maui

[Chorus]
Rolling down to Old Maui, me boys, rolling down to Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic Ground
Rolling down to Old Maui

[Verse 3]
Once more we sail with the northerly gale, towards our island home
Our mainmast sprung, our whaling done, and we ain't got far to roam
Our stu'n's'l bones is carried away, what care we for that sound?
A living gale is after us, thank God we're homeward bound
You might also like[Chorus]
Rolling down to Old Maui, me boys, rolling down to Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic Ground
Rolling down to Old Maui

[Verse 4]
How soft the breeze through the island trees, now the ice is far astern
Them native maids, them tropical glades, is awaiting our return
Even now their big brown eyes look out, hoping some fine day to see
Our baggy sails, running 'fore the gales, rolling down to Old Maui

[Chorus]
Rolling down to Old Maui, me boys, rolling down to Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic Ground
Rolling down to Old Maui
Rolling down to Old Maui, me boys, rolling down to Old Maui
We're homeward bound from the Arctic Ground
Rolling down to Old Maui
