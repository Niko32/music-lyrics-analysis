I saw her standing on her front lawn
Just a-twirling her baton
Me and her went for a ride, sir
And ten innocent people died

[Verse 2]
From the town of Lincoln, Nebraska
With a sawed-off .410 on my lap
Through the badlands of Wyoming
I killed everything in my path

[Verse 3]
I can't say that I'm sorry
For the things that we done
At least for a little while, sir
Me and her, we had us some fun

[Verse 4]
Now, the jury brought in a guilty verdict
And the judge, he sentenced me to death
Midnight in a prison storeroom
With leather straps across my chest

[Verse 5]
Sheriff, when the man pulls that switch, sir
And snaps my poor head back
You make sure my pretty baby
Is sittin' right there on my lap
You might also like[Verse 6]
They declared me unfit to live
Said into that great void my soul'd be hurled
They want to know why I did what I did
Well, sir, I guess there's just a meanness in this world
