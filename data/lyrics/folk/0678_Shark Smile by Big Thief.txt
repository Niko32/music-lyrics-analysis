She was a shark smile in a yellow van
She came around and I stole her glance
In my youth, a vampire
Evelyn shone quiet as roses sting
It came over me at a bad time
But who wouldn't ride on a moonlit line?
I had her in my eye, 85 down the road of a dead end gleam

[Chorus]
And she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too

[Verse 2]
It came over her at a bad time
Riding through Winona down the dotted line
Held us gunning out
90 miles down the road of a dead end dream
She looked over with her part smile
Caught up in the twinkle, it could take awhile
And the money pile on the dashboard fluttering

[Chorus]
As she said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too
You might also like[Verse 3]
Evelyn's kiss was oxygen
I leaned over to take it in
As we went howling through the edge of south Des Moines
It came over me at a bad time
She burned over the double line
And she impaled as I reached my hand for the guard rail
Ooh the guard rail
Ooh the guard rail

[Chorus]
She said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too
She said woo
Baby, take me
And I said woo
Baby, take me too
