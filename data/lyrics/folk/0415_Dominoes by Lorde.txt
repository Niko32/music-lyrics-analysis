I heard that you were doing yoga
With Uma Thurman's mother
Just outside of Woodstock
Now you're watering all the flowers
You planted with your new girlfriend
Outside on the rooftop

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another phase you're rushing on through
Go all New Age, outrunning your blues

[Chorus]
Fifty gleaming chances in a row
Then I watch you flick them down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again

[Verse 2]
I know
Know a girl who knows a
Another girl who knows the woman that you hurt
It's strange to see you smoking marijuana
You used to do the most cocaine
Of anyone I'd ever met

[Pre-Chorus]
Just another phase you're shooting on through
The whole world changеs right around you
You might also like[Chorus]
You get fifty gleaming chances in a row
And I watch you flick thеm down like dominoes
Must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again (Don't get up)
Yeah, it must feel good being Mr. Start-Again
