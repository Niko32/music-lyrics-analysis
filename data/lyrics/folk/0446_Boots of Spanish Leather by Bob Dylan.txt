Oh, I'm sailin' away, my own true love
I'm a-sailin' away in the mornin'
Is there somethin' I can send you from across the sea
From the place that I'll be landin'?

[Verse 2]
No, there's nothin' you can send me, my own true love
There's nothin' I'm a-wishing to be ownin'
Just a-carry yourself back to me unspoiled
From across that lonesome ocean

[Verse 3]
Ah, but I just thought you might want somethin' fine
Made of silver or of golden
Either from the mountains of Madrid
Or from the coast of Barcelona

[Verse 4]
But if I had the stars of the darkest night
And the diamonds from the deepest ocean
I'd forsake them all for your sweet kiss
For that's all I'm wishin' to be ownin'

[Verse 5]
Well, I might be gone a long old time
And it's only that I'm asking
Is there somethin' I can send you to remember me by
To make your time more easy passin'?
You might also like[Verse 6]
Oh, how can, how can you ask me again?
It only brings me sorrow
The same thing I would want today
I would want again tomorrow

[Verse 7]
Oh, I got a letter on a lonesome day
It was from her ship a-sailin'
Sayin', "I don't know when I'll be comin' back again
It depends on how I'm a-feelin'"

[Verse 8]
If a-you, my love, must think that-a-way
I'm sure your mind is a-roamin'
I'm sure your thoughts are not with me
But with the country to where you're goin'

[Verse 9]
So, take heed, take heed of the western winds
Take heed of the stormy weather
And, yes, there's somethin' you can send back to me
Spanish boots of Spanish leather
