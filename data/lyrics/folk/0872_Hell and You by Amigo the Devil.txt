Went to the bar
To get a little closer to myself and learn
Things I never really wanted to know
The walk got a little far
So I got into a cab that smelled like vinegar
Stains that showed what's in the girl before

[Bridge 1]
But I want to be
Where all the stupid things I say
Sounds so romantic and true

[Chorus]
Cause I'd rot in hell with you
If you'd just ask me to
I love the shitty things we do together
Live with me in this sin forever
Hell, and you -
I know you want it too
I say, take the shot, see this chance
Feel the fire and let me have this
Dance with you

[Verse 2]
We take things a little far
But you couldn't name a place I wouldn't go with you
A plane, a train, a car, I'd run
If I was dead I'd float
I'd crawl in bed with you
Even on someone else's blood
On top of someone else's love
In the worst motel we find
You might also like[Bridge 2]
Cause home is the last place
That I'd stand to be with anyone but you

[Chorus]
Cause I'd rot in hell with you
If you'd just ask me to
I love the shitty things we do together
Live with me in this sin forever
Hell, and you -
I know you want it too
I say, take the shot, see this chance
Feel the fire and let me have this
Dance with you
