How did it start? Did I fall into a nuclear reactor?
Crawl out with acid skin or somethin' worse
A hostile alien ambassador?
Or am I simply another of the universe's failed experiments?
Either way, I have been wonderin' just how it is (How it is)
I have never heard (Never heard) the tale of how I got my powers

[Verse 2: Baker]
Thrust into bein', careenin' along
On a crooked little trajectory
Dissolvin' in movement, a body in orbit
Or a roach on his way to the gutter

[Verse 3: All]
The tail of a comet burned up in an instant, the destruction of matter
There's no object to be seen in the supercollider
Just a light in the tunnel and whatever gets scattered
Life flashin' before the eye of whatever comes after
The force of our impact, the fission
The hum of our contact, the sound of our collisions
