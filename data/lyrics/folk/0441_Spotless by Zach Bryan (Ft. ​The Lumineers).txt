Turn on the TV, act like you don't see me
Tell me everything is okay
My mother is a saint and told me if I wait
Everything meant to be will stay
Well, I ain't a believer in people pleasing neither
Fucking telephones have ruined this place
Met a man in New York City, told me humans ain't as pretty
As a perfect day we'll chase for all the days

[Chorus: Wesley Schultz & Zach Bryan]
I ain't spotless, neither is you
For once in my life, I'm gonna see it through
If you want spotless, I'll always losе
I don't want love, lover, I want the truth

[Verse 2: Wesley Schultz, Zach Bryan]
Pеople die a thousand times to get to who they are
You were praying to the heavens on a late train car
You heart knows deeper seasons than my eyes ever will
I'm a self-destructive landslide if you wanna be the hill

[Chorus: Wesley Schultz & Zach Bryan]
I ain't spotless, neither is you
For once in my life, I'm gonna see it through
If you wanna leave this, that's okay
Everything meant to be is bound to stay

Remember jumpin' in the pool when we was fully clothed in August?
We were soakin', chokin', smokin' in my old shitty apartment
Then they cut off all the lights 'cause the bills were never paid
We were stealing all the power from the neighbors on vacation

[Chorus: Zach Bryan, Wesley Schultz & Zach Bryan]
I ain't spotless, neither is you
For once in my life, I'm gonna see it through
If you want spotless, I'll always lose
You gave me your love, lover, you gave me the truth

[Bridge: Wesley Schultz]
I was alone
You were bettin' on a loser, you were calling my bluff
Holding one another, is it never enough?
You were right there with me

[Chorus: Wesley Schultz & Zach Bryan]
I can't stop this, neither can you
For once in my life, I'm down to see it through
If you want spotless, I'll always lose
You gave me your love, lover, you gave me the truth
