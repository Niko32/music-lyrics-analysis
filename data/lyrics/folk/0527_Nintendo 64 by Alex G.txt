My dog just ran away and I am feeling pretty bad
I've been sneaking out at night and my parents are real mad
I’ve been taking lots of drugs 'cause they teach me not to care
Yeah, I guess that’s how you cheat because life doesn’t play fair

Mmm-mm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm

[Verse 2]
My brother told me that he's gonna kill himself tonight
With a whole bottle of Prozac or a shiny kitchen knife
He said that when he is dead I'll have his Nintendo 64
And I can play it all night long, sitting on the basement floor

[Bridge]
Mmm-mm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm

[Verse 3]
My girlfriend told me that she doesn't love me anymore
And I wish I didn't care but I thought she was really cool
So I drank a ton of liquor then I threw up in her sink
She said next time use the toilet then she offered me a drink

Mmm-mm, mmm-mm-mmm
Mmm-mm-mmm, mmm-mm-mmm
