I never said it, but I know that I
Can't picture anything past twenty-five
Not like I care to know the timing
Not like I'm looking for that silence
Self diagnosing 'til I'm borderline
I'll do whatever helps to sleep at night
Until I'm feeling like an island
Until I'm strong enough to hide it
What was I thinking looking for a sign?
As if I've ever seen the stars align
Somebody take over the driving
Somebody notice how I'm trying
Somebody notice how I'm trying

[Chorus]
When I'm toeing that line all of the time
Calling it fine, calling it fine
Toeing that line all of the timе
Calling it fine, calling it fine

[Verse 2]
How do you call it when you'rе in your head?
Like when you really keep inside of it?
I only talk into the mirror
I'm only scared of getting bigger
At least I'll never turn to cigarettes
My brother shielded me from all of that
He said that smoking was a killer
He said he knows that I've been bitter
Maybe I'm waiting for the "go ahead"
The validation that I never get
Most of the game is unfamiliar
Most of the girls are getting thinner
You might also like[Chorus]
Toeing that line all of the time
Calling it fine, calling it fine
Toein' that line all of the time
Calling it fine, calling it fine

[Bridge]
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping
All of me, a wound to close
But I leave the whole thing open
I just wanted you to know
I was never good at coping

[Outro]
I never said it but I know that I
Can't picture anything past twenty-five
Not like I care to know the timing
Not like I'm looking for that silence
I never said it but I know that I
I bury baggage 'til it's out of sight
I think it's better if I hide it
I really hope that I survive this
