Oh, well, who was I
Who was I to watch you wilt?
You ain't gotta tell me what it means
Trace the outlines of your dreams
You'll always be a flower on my skin
And the pain that I am in
Mm, it's all the same
The losing touch, the waiting game
Cross that county line
I promise to be there this time
Alright?

[Chorus]
You were a work of art
That's the hardest part
Howlin' like dogs in the light of the moon
Holdin' our breath after 132
You asked me why I wasn't sayin' a word
I'm naming the stars in the sky after you
It was a work of art
That's the hardest part

[Bridge]
To spiral out, to try and float
To see a friend, to see a ghost
Bitter-brained, always drunk
Rail-thin, Zoloft
Subtle changе, shorter days
Dead-eyеd, dead weight
Your life, your dreams
Your mind, your needs
My needs
Your needs, my needs
You might also like[Outro]
Spiral out, try and float
See a friend, see a ghost
To see a ghost, see a ghost
See a ghost
