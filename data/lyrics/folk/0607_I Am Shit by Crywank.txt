Language is scary when over-analysed
Every word that I say seems far too contrived
What are your intentions? I'm ashamed by mine
When I'm thinking too much I realise I'm unkind
Pretend that I'm nicer than I'll ever be
I'm selfish and deluded, enjoy my hypocrisy
Complain that I'm bored, when being bored is a privilege
Act like I'm suffering, there's no suffering in this

[Verse 2]
First world problems, they breed in my head
Ethical contradictions between my actions and what I've said
I should just shut my mouth as evidence piles against me
That I am so much worse than I think, exposed as a phoney

[Chorus]
I am shit, I am shit
Nah nah nuh nuh fucking dick
I am shit, I am shit
Nah nah nuh nuh nuh nuhYou might also like
