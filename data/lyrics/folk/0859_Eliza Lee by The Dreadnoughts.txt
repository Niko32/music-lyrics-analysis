The smartest clipper you can find is
Ho-way, ho, are you 'most done?
She's the Margaret Evans of the Blue Star Line
Clear away the track an' let the bullgine run!

[Chorus]
To me hey rig-a-jig in a jaunting gun
Ho-way, ho, are you 'most done?
With Liza Lee all on my knee
Clear away the track an' let the bullgine run!

[Verse 2]
O, we're outward bound for the West Street Pier
Ho-way, ho, are you 'most done?
With Galway shale and Liverpool beer
Clear away the track an' let the bullgine run!

[Chorus]
To me hey rig-a-jig in a jaunting gun
Ho-way, ho, are you 'most done?
With Liza Lee all on my knee
Clear away the track an' let the bullgine run!

[Verse 3]
Ah, and when we're out in New York Town
Ho-way, ho, are you 'most done?
We'll dance them Bowery girls around!
Clear away the track an' let the bullgine run!
You might also like[Chorus]
To me hey rig-a-jig in a jaunting gun
Ho-way, ho, are you 'most done?

Clear away the track an' let the bullgine run!
