And there's a centipede
Naked in your bedroom
Oh, and you swear to God
The fucker's out to get you

[Chorus]
And I digress
'Cause I must make you the perfect morning
I try my best
To scoop the slugger out the window

[Verse 2]
And there's a praying mantis
Prancing on your bathtub
And you swear it's a priest
From a past life out to getcha

[Chorus]
And I digress
'Cause I must make you the perfect evening
I try my best
To put the priest inside a jam jar

[Verse 3]
And there's a millipede
Angry on your carpet
Oh, and I must admit
He's staring with a vengeance
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, and I digress
'Cause I must make you the perfect morning
And I try my best
To prove that nothing's out to get you
To prove that nothing's out to get you
