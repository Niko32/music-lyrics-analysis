[Verse 1]
Peel the mask away, drop the masquerade
Lose the tough guy facade
The world's a scary place, everybody's afraid
Whether they'd like to admit-it or not, it's the truth

[Break]

[Verse 2]
Sooner or later this party gets busted
And all your friends stumble back home
But you're the loose cannon that could never be trusted
So you'll hide from the cops all alone again

[Chorus]
Tell me when the fire dies down, what the fuck will you do?
When the man comes around, what the fuck will you do?
Who's gonna be there to catch you when your plans all fall through?
When you were flyin' your white flag who never gave up on you?

[Break]

[Verse 3]
The future is terrifying, it constantly plagues my mind
Where will I be in ten years?
Will I be homeless? Or buried? Or have children and be married?
Or will I still be stuck standin' right here?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Either way it's been a privilege to have had time to spend
With my wonderful family and friends
So I'll toast to all of you and to all that you do
You're fuckin' awesome, don't you ever forget!

[Chorus]
'Cause when the fire dies down, what the fuck will you do?
When the man comes around, what the fuck will you do?
Who's gonna be there to catch you when your plans all fall through?
When you were flyin' your white flag who never gave up on you?

[Break]

[Bridge]
Build up your confidence will lead to have a breakdown
And every morning that you wake up is a let down
Find yourself a comfort or two, adjust until you're face down
Blackout, fucked up, just to help yourself forget
The world we live in is a terrifying place
Who're gonna be the ones who are there when the rest have gone away?
The ones who've turned their backs on you, they're staggerin' off the plank
Come back a fuckin' cannon, blow 'em away and watch 'em sink

[Break]
[Chorus]
Tell me when the fire dies down, what the fuck will you do?
When the man comes around, what the fuck will you do?
Who's gonna be there to catch you when your plans all fall through?
When you were flyin' your white flag who never gave up?

[Chorus]
When the fire dies down, what the fuck will you do?
When the man comes around, what the fuck will you do?
Who's gonna be there to catch you when your plans all fall through?
When you were flyin' your white flag who never gave up on you?

[Outro]
*Dog barking* He
He-he
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, Tim
*Growling*
