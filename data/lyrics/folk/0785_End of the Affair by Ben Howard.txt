The end of the after
The weight of a war
The kindness gone to bed
The weight of your laughter
Alive in the hall
Did he hear, did he hear the fumbled words you said?

[Chorus]
Living without her
Living at all
Seems to slow me down
Living forever
Hell I don't know
Do I care, do I care the thunder's rumbled sound?

[Verse]
And now I watch her
Running round in love again
Now I talk about you
When I'm with our mutual friends

[Pre-Chorus]
The end of the after
The weight of a war
The kindness gone to bed
The threat of your laughter
Alive after all
Did he hear, did he hear the fumbled words you said?
You might also like[Chorus]
Living without her
Living at all
Seems to slow me down
Living forever
Pale light on all
Do I care, do I care the thunder's rumbled sound?

[Verse]
And now I watch her
Running round in love again
Now I talk about you
When I'm with our mutual friends

[Verse]
And now I watch her
Running round in love again
Now I talk about you
When I'm with our mutual friends

[Bridge]
Could you be, could you be alone?
My hatred, my hate will bring me closer

[Outro]
This is it?
Well this is desert
And what of him?
What the hell, love?
This is it?
Well this is desert
And what of him?
What the hell, love?
This is it?
What the hell, love?
What the hell, love?
