This makes me feel like a weak man who thinks that he is strong
Must I play the chauvinist to be the man you want?
Sweaty fingers push down on your throat, you say you like it rough
But it's hard to think I do this out of love
And from my own submissive pleasure, I wanna do just as you wish
But I slap your face too lightly when you ask me to make fists
Kiss me softly, do not bite, we can explore like naughty kids
You say you're bored, want dominating
And I just stare and flinch

[Bridge]
Oh, how rude of me to bring my thoughts into your bedroom
Is it condescending to be so scared I might hurt you?
Oh, how rude of me to bring my thoughts into your bedroom
Is it condescending to be so scared I might hurt you?
