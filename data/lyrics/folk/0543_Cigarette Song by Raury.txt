It's gone
Said itâ€™s gone kill you, yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I shared my cigarette with her, yeah
I fucked her every Wednesday evening, evening, evening
Why do you always use that word, yeah
When you don't even know its meaning, meaning, meaning?
Well see I'll always be your friend
Ill always be there when the sun sets, sun sets, sun sets
But we've been gifted with the end, yeah
Who really wants to live forever, ever, ever, ever, ever

[Chorus 1]
But I can't love you right
I can't love you, I won't love you
But if you want the light
I'll provide it, I'll supply you
Said I can't love you right
I can't love you, I won't love you
But if you want the light
I'll, I'll provide it, I'll supply you
With these cigarettes
Light it up girl, have a ball, it's gonna kill you, kill you, kill you, kill you, kill you, kill you, kill you

I shared my cigarette with her, yeah
I fucked her every Wednesday evening, evening, evening
Guess I'm an owl amongst the birds, yeah
I won't remember what you tell me, tell me, tell me
Girl tell me everything tonight, yeah
I'll keep the secrets, you can tell me, (tell me) it's easy
I move in silence through the shade
It's no surprise that he can't see me, see me, see me, see me, see me

[Chorus 2]
But I can't love you right
I can't love you, I won't love you
But if you want the light
I'll provide it, I'll supply you
And if you fuck me right
You can say it, I might say it
But don't you be surprised (don't cry)
I'm only yours tonight
That's only for tonight, I'm gon' be yours tonight
(But I can't love you right)
(I can't love you, I won't love you)
(But if you want the light)
(I'll provide it, I'll supply you)
