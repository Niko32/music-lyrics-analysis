I could go off the deep end
I could kill all my best friends
I could follow those stylish trends
And God knows I could make amends
But I've got an angry heart
Filled with cancers and poppy tarts
If this is how you folks make art
It's fuckin' depressing

[Refrain]
And it's sad to know that we are not alone
And it's sad to know there's no honest way out

[Verse 2]
I'm afraid to leave the house
I'm as timid as a mouse
I'm afraid if I go out
I'll outwear my welcome
I am not a courageous man
I don't have any big, lasting plans
I'm too cowardly to take a stand
I wanna keep my nose clean

[Refrain]
And it's sad to know that we're not alone in this
And it's sad to know there's no honest way out

In this life we lead, we could conquer everything
If we could just get the braves to get out of bed in the morning
