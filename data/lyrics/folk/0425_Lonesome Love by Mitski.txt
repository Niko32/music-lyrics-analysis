I call you, to see you again
So I can win, and this can finally end
Spend an hour on my makeup
To prove something

[Verse 2]
Walk up in my high heels
All high and mighty
And you say "Hello"
And I lose

[Bridge]
'Cause nobody butters me up like you, and
Nobody fucks me like me

[Verse 3]
In the morning, in a taxi
I'm so very payin' for

[Chorus]
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely for lonesome love?
Why am I lonely?

[Outro]
