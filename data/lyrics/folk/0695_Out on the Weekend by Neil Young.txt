Think I'll pack it in and buy a pick-up
Take it down to L.A
Find a place to call my own and try to fix up
Start a brand new day

[Pre-Chorus]
The woman I'm thinking of, she loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling

[Chorus]
See the lonely boy out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy, he tries to speak and
Can't begin to say

[Verse 2]
She got pictures on the wall, they make me look up
From her big brass bed
Now I'm running down the road, trying to stay up
Somewhere in her head

[Pre-Chorus]
The woman I'm thinking of, she loved me all up
But I'm so down today
She's so fine, she's in my mind
I hear her calling
You might also like[Chorus]
See the lonely boy out on the weekend
Trying to make it pay
Can't relate to joy, he tries to speak and
Can't begin to say
