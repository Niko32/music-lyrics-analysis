Up on the mountain, caught on the rail line
Up on the mountain, caught on the rail line

[Verse 1]
My brother, let the hard drugs be
Drink your wine, smoke your weed
My brother, let the hard stuff be

[Pre-Chorus]
And wear your silver lining
Wear it close to your skin

[Chorus]
But if it's the drugs, the women, the wine, the weed
The love that took everything I own
Just take it all
And tell the ones you love you love them
Teach only what you know, and oh
You better know it well

[Verse 2]
We drove from coast to coast
Down in New Orleans where the levees broke 'cause
You were tripping, I was driving
You were running, I was hiding
And you know I know how that feels
Don't get cheated, kid, just swing from your heels
And if you get carried away
Let the music play you through the pain
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And wear that silver lining
Wear it close to your skin

[Chorus]
But if it's the drugs, the women, the wine, the weed
The love that took everything I own
Just take it all
And tell the ones you love you love them
Teach only what you know, and oh
You better know it well

[Outro]
Up on the mountain, caught on the rail line
Up on the mountain, caught on the rail line
