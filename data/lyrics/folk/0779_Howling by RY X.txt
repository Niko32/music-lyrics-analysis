Hot nights coming
Keep the car running
Lavender fingers
Swallow my pollen

[Chorus]
Gold, I swam into your spell
On the rite of God we fell
You were plush and I laid bare
You had me howling
Cold, I fell into your skin
On the night you led me under your sin
You had me howling
You had me howling

Golden siren
Under exposing
Come lay your weakness down
On the floor in the backseat
You might also like[Chorus]
Gold, I fell into your spell
On the rite of God we fell
You were plush and I laid bare
You had me howling
Cold, I fell into your skin
On the night you led me under your sin
You had me howling
You had me howling
