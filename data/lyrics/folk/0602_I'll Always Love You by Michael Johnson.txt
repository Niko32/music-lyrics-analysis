Standing by my window
Listening for your call
Guess I really miss you
After all
Time won't let me
Keep these sad thoughts to myself
I'd just like to let you know
I wish I'd never let you go

[Chorus]
And I'll always love you
Deep inside this heart of mine, I do!
Love you
And I'll always need you
And if you ever
Change your mind, I'll still
I will
Love you

[Verse 2]
Wish you'd never left me
But love's a mystery
You can break a heart
So easily
The days and nights reveal
How much I feel for you?
Time has come for me to see
How much your love has meant to me?
You might also like[Chorus]
And I'll always love you
And if you ever
Change your mind, I'll still
I will
Love you

[Bridge]
Time like a river keeps on
Rollin' right on by
Nothing left for me to do
So I watch the river rise?

[Chorus]
And I'll always love you
Deep inside this heart of mine, I do!
Love you
And I'll always need you
And if you ever
Change your mind, I'll still
I will
I'll still
I will
Love you
