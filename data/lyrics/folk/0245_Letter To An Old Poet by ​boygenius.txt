I said, "I think that you're special"
You told me once that I'm selfish
And I kissed you hard
In the dark, in the closet
You said my music is mellow
Maybe I'm just exhausted
You think you're a good person
Because you won't punch me in the stomach

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers, All]
And I love you
I don't know why
I just do, ooh, but

[Chorus: All]
You're not special, you're evil
You don't get to tell me to calm down
You made me feel like an equal
But I'm better than you
And you should know that by now
When you fell down the stairs
It looked like it hurt and I wasn't sorry
I shoulda left you right there
With your hostages, my heart and my car keys
You don't know me
You might also like[Bridge: All]
I wanna be happy
I'm ready to walk into my room without lookin' for you
I'll go up to the top of our building
And remember my dog when I see the full moon

[Outro: All]
I can't feel it yet
But I am waiting
