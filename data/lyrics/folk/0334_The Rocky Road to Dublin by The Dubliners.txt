Well, in the merry month of May now from me home I started
Left the girls of Tuam nearly broken hearted
Saluted father dear, kissed me darling mother
Drank a pint of beer, me grief and tears to smother
Then off to reap the corn and leave where I was born
Cut a stout blackthorn to banish ghosts and goblins
A brand new pair of brogues to rattle over the bogs
And frighten all the dogs on the rocky road to Dublin

[Chorus]
One, two, three four, five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin, whack follol de dah

[Verse 2]
In Mullingar that night I rested limbs so weary
Started by daylight next morning light and early
Took a drop of the pure to keep me heart from shrinkin'
Thats the Paddy's cure whene'er he's on for drinkin'
To hear the lassies smile, laughin' all the while
At me curious style, 'twould set your heart a bubblin'
They asked me was I hired and wages I required
Till I was almost tired of the rocky road to Dublin

[Chorus]
One, two, three four, five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin, whack follol de dah

In Dublin next arrived, I thought it such a pity
To be so soon deprived a view of that fine city
Then I took a stroll, all among the quality
Bundle it was stole, well in a neat locality
Something crossed me mind, when I looked behind
No bundle could I find upon me stick a wobblin'
Enquiring after the rogue, said me Connacht brogue
It wasn't much in vogue on the rocky road to Dublin

[Chorus]
One, two, three four, five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin, whack follol de dah

[Verse 4]
From there I got away, me spirits never failing
Landed on the quay, just as the ship was sailing
Captain at me roared, said that no room had he
When I jumped aboard, a cabin found for Paddy
Down among the pigs, did some hearty rigs
I played some hearty jigs, the water round me bubbling
When off Holyhead I wished meself was dead
Or better far instead on the rocky road to Dublin

[Chorus]
One, two, three four, five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin, whack follol de dah
[Verse 5]
The boys of Liverpool, well when we safely landed
Called meself the fool, I could no longer stand it
Blood began to boil, temper I was losing
Poor old Erin's Isle they began abusing
"Hurrah me soul" says I, me shillelagh I let fly
Galway boys were by and saw I was a hobblin'
With a low a' "hurray!" they joined in the affray
Quickly clear the way for the rocky road to Dublin

[Chorus]
One, two, three four, five
Hunt the Hare and turn her down the rocky road
And all the ways to Dublin, whack follol de dah
