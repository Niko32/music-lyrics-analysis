At some point, I used to wish I would disappear from this world
The whole world seemed so dark and I cried every night
Will I feel better if I just disappeared?
I was so afraid of everyone's eyes on me

[Pre-Chorus]
During those beautifully beautiful days, I was in pain
I hated myself for not being able to receive love
My mom and my dad, they're only looking at me
Itâ€™s not how I really feel but I keep getting farther away

[Refrain]
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?
What do I do?

[Verse 2]
The saying time is medicine was really true for me
As the days went by, I really got better
But sometimes, when I'm too happy
I'm afraid I'll be in pain again
I'm afraid that someone will take away this happiness

[Pre-Chorus]
Those beautifully beautiful memories were so painful
I was hurting and hurting but the pain wouldn't go away
My friends, all these people, they're only looking at me
This isn't how I really am but I keep getting farther away
You might also like[Chorus]
But still, maybe I can be
A bright light in this world
Maybe after all of that pain
I can shortly shine a light
So I couldn't give up
I couldn't fall asleep peacefully for a single night
Because maybe if I keep trying to get up like this
I will find myself

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Outro]
How painful must it have been?
How painful must it have been?
How high must my hopes have been?
