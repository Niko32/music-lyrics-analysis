I've barely been to college
And I've been doubtful
Of all that I have dreamed of
The brink of my existence essentially is a comedy
The gap in my teeth and all that I can cling to

The milk is sour
Sha la la
Oom oom sha la la
Oom sha la la
Oom oom sha la la
The milk is sour
With olives on my thumbs
And all that I have stuck to and all that I have clung to
I've felt like a dog
This world that I have trusted
Is bent over and busted and rusted by an arbitrary sonogram

Sha la la
Oom oom sha la la
Oom sha la la
Oom oom sha la la
Oom sha la la
Oom oom sha la la
Oom sha la la
Oom oom sha la la

If you don't go outside
Well nothing's gonna happen
She'll never write her number on a crumpled up napkin
She'll never be your ego
She'll never be a bandit
She'll never get to eat you like your heart's a pomegranate
I'm throwing out the milk
The olives got old
I'm tired of my mind getting heavy with mold
I need to start a garden
I need to start a garden
I need to start a garden
I need to start a garden!
Gonna start a garden in my backyard
I'm gonna start a garden in my backyard
'Cause making this song up is just as hard
'Cause making this song up is just as hard
