Met you at the dive bar to go shoot some pool
And make fun of the cowboys with the neck tattoos
Ask you easy questions about work and school

[Chorus: Baker]
I'm trying to be cool about it
Feelin' like an absolute fool about it
Wishin' you were kind enough to be cruel about it
Tellin' myself I can always do without it
Knowing that it probably isn't true

[Verse 2: Dacus, All]
I came prepared for absolution, if you'd only ask
So I take some offense when you say, "No regrets"
I remember it's impossible to pass your test

[Chorus: All, Dacus]
But I'm trying to forget about it
Feelin' like I'm breaking a sweat about it
Wishin' you would kindly get out of my head about it
Tеllin' myself, one day, I'll forget about it
Knowing that it probably isn't truе

[Verse 3: Bridgers, All]
Once, I took your medication to know what it's like
And now I have to act like I can't read your mind
I ask you how you're doing and I let you lie
You might also like[Chorus: All]
But we don't have to talk about it
I can walk you home and practice method acting
I'll pretend bein' with you doesn't feel like drowning
Tellin' you it's nice to see how good you're doing
Even though we know it isn't true
