There are three words, that I've been dying to say to you
Burns in my heart, like a fire that ain't goin' out
There are three words, and I want you to know they are true
I need to let you know

[Chorus]
I wanna say I love you, I wanna hold you tight
I want your arms around me and I want your lips on mine
I wanna say I love you, but babe, I'm terrified
My hands are shakin', my heart is racin'
'Cause it's something I can't hide, it's something I can't deny
So here I go

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I love you

[Verse 2]
I've never said, these words to anyone, anyone at all
Never got this close, cause I was always afraid I would fall
But now I know, that I'll fall right into your arms
Don't ever let me go

[Chorus]
I wanna say I love you, I wanna hold you tight
I want your arms around me and I want your lips on mine
I wanna say I love you, but babe, I'm terrified
My hands are shakin', my heart is racin'
'Cause it's something I can't hide, it's something I can't deny
So here I go
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I love you

[Bridge]
Take it in, breathe the air
What is there to really fear
I can't contain, what my heart's sayin'
I gotta say it out loud

[Chorus]
I wanna say I love you, I wanna hold you tight
I want your arms around me and I want your lips on mine
I wanna say I love you, but babe, I'm terrified
My hands are shakin', my heart is racin'
'Cause it's something I can't hide, it's something I can't deny
So here I go

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, I love you
