Was there a lifetime waiting for us
In a world where I was yours?

[Verse 1]
Paper planes and porcelain
Smell of rain through the window pane
And the sight of you
Oh, you were a good dream

[Verse 2]
I was scared to lose you then
But secrets turn into regrets
Buried feelings grow
Oh, you were a good dream

[Chorus]
Was there a lifetime waiting for us
In a world where I was yours?
Was it the wrong time, what if we tried
Giving in a little more?
To the warmth we had before

[Verse 3]
Tangled with another's eyes
Never mind, you were never mine
Glimpse of me and you
Oh, you were a good dream
You might also like[Chorus]
Was there a lifetime waiting for us
In a world where I was yours?
Was it the wrong time, what if we tried
Giving in a little more?
I'd spend a lifetime waiting in vain
Just to go back to the way we were before
Was it the wrong time, what if we tried
Giving in a little more?
To the warmth we had before

[Outro]
Is there a lifetime waiting for us?
All this time, I have been yours
