I need your body in ways
That you don't understand, but I'm losin' my patience
'Cause we been goin' over and over again
Girl, I just wanna take you home
And get right to it
Know I gotta kiss it, baby
Give it to me, lick it, lick it inside and out
You know that I just wanna make love
Want you to scream and shout
And baby, when I'm deep in it now
I'ma slow it down, 'cause ain't no speed limit
When we're movin' at the speed of sound
We gon' turn all the way up when the lights down
Why your pussy so damn good, miss lady?
Go and put that booty up, baby, one on one
You know I'ma go crazy when your legs in the air
You know your panties never gettin' in the way
You know I kinda like it, when you make me work for it (Ow!)

[Chorus]
Ayy you girl, with all di tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door
Shake that ass like boom-shakalaka (Boom), boom-shakalaka (Boom)
We don't need nobody watchin' us (Yikes!)
No eyes but your eyes
Ain't nobody here but you and me
Lickin' your private parts (Boom-shakalaka)
And I know you love your privacy (Hahaha)

You don't need a shower, you already wet
Know that pussy power, tellin' me, I ain't ready yet
I say, "Fuck it," face my fears, baby
When I lick it, I put tears in it
Put my face in it, eat it like a dinner date
You know I love foreplay, 12 Play, everything
Know my lovin' don't change
I don't really give a fuck what a hater say
'Cause you fine, baby
And it's alright 'cause you're all mine, baby (Ooh-ooh)
Girl, I'ma let you get crazy (Ow!)

[Chorus]
Ayy you girl, with all di tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door
Shake that ass like boom-shakalaka (Boom), boom-shakalaka (Boom)
We don't need nobody watchin' us (Yikes!)
No eyes but your eyes
Ain't nobody here but you and me
Lickin' your private parts (Boom-shakalaka)
And I know you love your privacy

[Verse 3]
Baby, I promise I won't tell nobody
Just long as you let me hit it like every night
I could give a fuck â€˜bout the club 'cause that pussy tight
Do a split on it, drop it, baby, show you right
I'ma split your weave, then you askin' me to stay the night
Whipped cream on your titties, then you suckin' on my dick with ice
Oh, my God, oh, my God, my bitch get me right
Ain't gotta pay for that pussy, my dick can change your life
I'm tired of missionary, wanna see you on your face
Put that ass up in the air, I'm lovin' how that pussy taste
Damn, on your side, on your side
Stop runnin' from this dick, I ain't 'bout to let you slide this time (Ow!)
[Chorus]
Ayy you girl, with all di tight up skirt
Get that ass in the bed, I'ma lock the door
Shake that ass like boom-shakalaka (Boom), boom-shakalaka (Boom)
We don't need nobody watchin' us (Yikes!)
No eyes but your eyes
Ain't nobody here but you and me
Lickin' your private parts (Boom-shakalaka)
And I know you love your privacy (Hahaha)

[Outro]
