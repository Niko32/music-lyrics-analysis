I like shinin', you be lyin'
I be grindin', you waste time
Know you wanna roll with me
'Cause you know I put it down
When I show up, I'm the one and only
No, no, no (No, no)
Yeah, pull up in the Jag
Haters gon' be mad

[Verse 2: Jaehyun, Jungwoo, Taeyong]
I be walkin' with the cheese
That's that queso (Queso, queso)
Diamonds drippin'
Better bring your raincoat (Splash)
I got them racks on me (On me)
I brought the whole lit team with me
I might pull up in a spaceship
Hop out, it don't look like I live here

[Pre-Chorus: Taeil & Johnny, Doyoung, Haechan & Taeyong, Yuta & Mark]
And now we in the zone (Oh-oh-oh)
Stand too close, might catch a cold
Crib came with a gate and a code
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Drippin' water faucet (Splash)

VVS my diamonds, I don't need no light to shine
Iced out both my wrists, now I can barely see the time
I just made a million and I'm still not satisfied
'Cause I need that bag on the regular
I spend a bag on the regular

Hundreds all blue (Hundreds)
We do what we do (Ball)
