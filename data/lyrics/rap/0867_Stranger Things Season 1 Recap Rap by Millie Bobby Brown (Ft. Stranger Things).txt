Stranger Things
Season one recap
Make some noise!

[Verse: Millie Bobby Brown]
Let's go back to Indiana circa 1983
Just four boys in the basement chillin' playin' D&D
There was Lucas, there was Willy Will and Dustin, there was a Mike
But one night, Will goes missing while he’s ridin' on his bike
Yikes!
That's when they met me, Elev'
I had no hair on my head
I had been so close to dead
Courtesy of Dr. Brenner who's huntin' me twenty-four sev'
Joyce was hanging Christmas lights in the web
Started hearing something Willy had said
This could be a message from the beyond
What happened to Barb?
She’s just gone in the Upside Down
Hopper's on top of the case while I'm throwing vans into space
I'm lying down in a tank
Trying my best to find Willy and Dustin's got pudding for days
Demogorgon's getting all in my way
Blast him to pieces just like a grenade
Will's now at home, coughin' slugs in the sink
What happened to me? I'm in the Upside Down

What about now?
The saga continues, tune in to see how
Upside down, what about now?
The saga continues, tune in to see how
All I need is my Eggo waffles, I'm in love with those
What I'm left with when I use my powers is a bloody nose
Yeah

[Outro: Millie Bobby Brown]
Bad news when you see that bloody nose
Yeah, bad news when you see that bloody nose
