Very sexy, Keisha, Becky
Mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm

[Chorus: Tion Wayne & Russ]
Pull up, pull up and dump off, dump off
Twist up your waist and jump off, jump off
Free up, free up that number
Oh my God, look at that bumper, wha' the bomba? (Mhm-mhm)
Drip like my chain, shake that arse, it's insane
Very sexy, Keisha, Becky

[Verse 1: Russ]
Like baby stop it, everything's mad if I slap this rocket (Bullet)
Fit like ten bags in AMIRI pockets (Racks)
I love this shit, I can't stop it
Baby, arch your back and slide on it
Try hit chest, neck, belly or back
Manna big man, twenty racks on tax
Very sexy, yelly, Steffy (Bullet)
Baby shake up your bum-bum (Shake it)
Don't have sex without condoms (Nah)
Cali spliff looking Hong Kong (Loud)
I don't pipe your girl-, that's my don-don
Very selective, selected corn, eject it
The way he ran off, he meant it (Gone)

Yo, both hands on the back when I tap it, grab it and slap it, Becky a savage
Lemme show you a magic trick, you can have this dick after that man vanish
Two MILFs in a whip, bro-bro said he wanted a bit, told him he can manage
This baby face an advantage, man still show a big girl what a man is
Give her my screw face, she caught me staring, what do you expect when your skirt's so short?
Out here twerking, gone past caring, she went out cheating, the girl got caught
Stepped in the place all shiny, I don't have a chain, man glow when I walk
Don't phone if you're wasting my time, got me changing my line 'cause I don't wanna talk

[Chorus: Tion Wayne & Russ]
Pull up, pull up and dump off, dump off
Twist up your waist and jump off, jump off
Free up, free up that number
Oh my God, look at that bumper, wha' the bomba? (Mhm-mhm)
Drip like my chain, shake that arse, it's insane
Very sexy, Keisha, Becky

[Verse 3: JAY1]
How many L's did I take this year? And how many times did I buck your chicky?
Had a cap on my head like 50 when I gave wood to your girl, that's dicky
And I didn't wanna holla at Becky, so I went Brighton and holla'd at Britney
And how many chicks did I swipe? Top of my head, I think about fifty
And I don't really wanna hear nonsense
Man send one text to your female, now the bad B come looking like custard
Slim t'ic with the back come detail, give her back shot, two-two, now she loved it
And the ting come quick like a e-mail, mate well done, got brain and he cuffed it
JAY bun up the place like a moshpit, viral, now I got fans in Boston
Two stepped to the dance all saucy, one gun lean, man did it like Russ did
And everybody wanna link Keisha, Becky, ease up, likkle man stop it
Bad B from kway called Lisa, shit den, wanna take wood cah I'm poppin'
[Verse 4: Tion Wayne]
Everyday I give thanks for the blessings but I repent for numerous cheffings
If you saw the way that I kweffed him, man I weren't shocked that his bredrin left him
Bet they thought the last verse was a fluke ting, free my broski inside for some bootings
Man, I'm boasy, spend racks on a Cuban and my lightskin, brownskin or cute tings
Man I love to go west, spend figures, then I go home, eat bariis and hilib
African girl arch back, I wan' 'it-it, pounded yam with okra or spinach
Snapchat-cam them boy you're all image
White girl, Soul Food, Gaucho, Nobu
Mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm, mhm-mhm

[Chorus: Tion Wayne & Russ]
Pull up, pull up and dump off, dump off
Twist up your waist and jump off, jump off
Free up, free up that number
Oh my God, look at that bumper, wha' the bomba? (Mhm-mhm)
Drip like my chain, shake that arse, it's insane
Very sexy, Keisha, Becky

[Verse 5: Sav'O]
JS, JS
They ain't made for the shit, they're soft
I done drill first, think last
All these man wan' talk 'bout drill, they do drill rap but ain't got no heart
All the things man seen and done in the field, nigga you won't know the half
And bro told me he just done that bait, so now he's in a petrol bath
Bro backed it, I told him dump off, dump off, before I back it, they run off
Hit that once, you can't be my lover, HMP, free up my brother
Ambush I got my block jumpy, jumpy, gyal on me, man they love me
Two gyal, who's holding this brucky? Oh my god, look at that bumsy
[Verse 6: Swarmz]
(Nine-nine-nine)
See my guy got bagged for the chinging, the grind don't stop so we see this dough
I told bro just slap it in reverse with a petrol can and burn them clothes
A9 got caught with the grub, oh my, so he's looking like two do one
And I pray on my life that they ride in front the jakes so the whole tings done
Big up my chocolate darling, true say that she lost the plot
Doing up-Doing up Gucci gang with her nails on fleek as she whips that pot
My bro just reading the amm, take that to the OT spot
Like we was fifteen when we had the whole 9 block like Wizard of Oz
See, back the beef, you get got g
Nine side, we're on top b
Becky come and then slop me
And Keisha mad cah she's on me
Back the beef, you get got g
Nine side, we're on top b
Becky come and then slop me
And Keisha...

[Chorus: Tion Wayne & Russ]
Pull up, pull up and dump off, dump off
Twist up your waist and jump off, jump off
Free up, free up that number
Oh my God, look at that bumper, wha' the bomba? (Mhm-mhm)
Drip like my chain, shake that arse, it's insane
Very sexy, Keisha, Becky
