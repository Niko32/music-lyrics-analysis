ItWillAllBeOverSoon

[Verse]
And I'm always where the
Sun don't shine, the tears don't show, won't
Hurt me now 'cause heart's been broke, I
Hate myself, but it won't show, I
Constantly lose all my remorse, and it's
Ten for the wolf and three for the shepherd, and it's
One for the sheep who led by your leopard, often
Gave his perception as a handle of weapon, took a
Bite of your apple, give me all you can offer, now I'm
Trapped in a changing maze, settin' my soul ablaze
Couldn't control the pace, where is this going, hey?
Heartless is recklessness, it's word of a pacifist to
Word of a masochist, I'm off of the map, my Lord, I
Spoke to a Baphomet, he said he would save me if I
Gave him one thing he needed, "What is this thing?", I pleaded
Boy, it's the key to even, yeah

[Outro]
And as I spoke, my fangs were shown
Taken aback, he smiles and tells me
"What you crave will soon be yours
But what I crave is already mine"
