Fire is raging on the battlefield
While Arwald is fighting the war of the kings
The army of Dargor, the thunder, the storm
So people are calling the brave and his sword
No time left to save the wise throne!

[Verse 2]
Shades of a past not so far to forget
The rise of the demons from their bloody hell
So come mighty warrior to light the last hope
For Tharos the dragon and your cosmic soul
Now handle your emerald sword!

[Chorus]
For Ancelot
The ancient cross of war
For the holy town of gods
Gloria, Gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory

[Verse 3]
The ride of the dead and their practice of pain
Is pounding in him as a terrific quake
You're closer and closer, now follow the smell
With your holy armor and the steel in your hand
Fly angel of bloody revenge!
You might also like[Chorus]
For Ancelot
The ancient cross of war
For the holy town of gods
Gloria, Gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Tragic and furious the clash of the steel of the gods
That so magic the power, the sword in his valorous hands
Oceans of fire are blasting the throne of the demons
And from distant red skies and thunders are calling his name
The name of the master of pain

[Chorus]
For Ancelot
The ancient cross of war
For the holy town of gods
Gloria, Gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory

[Outro]
Gloria, Gloria perpetua
In this dawn of victory!
