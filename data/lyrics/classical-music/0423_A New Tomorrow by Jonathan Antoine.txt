Through a far off valley
To another time
We will travel hand in hand now
Dear friend of mine
Though your journey's over
Ours has just begun
Onward till the morning greets us
With a brand new sun

[Chorus]
Now I believe in a new tomorrow
I believe in a bright new day
Somewhere there's light beyond the shadows
And I believe we 'll find our way

[Verse 2]
Come with me my darling
Watch the evening bloom
In your darkest moments I would
Give my strength to you

[Chorus]
And I believe in a new tomorrow
I believe in a bright new day
Somewhere there's love beyond the shadows
And I believe we 'll find our way
So take my hand I'll lead us forward
All the hurt shall pass
Everyday is brighter than the last
You might also like[Verse 3]
I never knew this feeling
Until I found you
Looking in your eyes tonight dear
I know you feel it too

[Chorus]
Now I believe in a new tomorrow
I believe in a bright new day
Somewhere there's light beyond the shadows
And I believe we 'll find our way
Yes I believe in a new tomorrow
I believe there's a bright new day
Somewhere there's love beyond the shadows
And though the road is long
Together weâ€™ll strong
If we believe we'll find our way
