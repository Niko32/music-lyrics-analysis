I heard you singing underneath the moon
Sleepyhead
Go to bed
I hear your footsteps walkin' by my room
I'm okay, here to stay

[Verse 2]
I saw you making angels in the snow
Late at night
Wonder why
I see you laughing till morning looking all aglow
Meant to be
You and me

[Verse 3]
Said all along you wanted to be free
Don't you cry
Learn to fly
I know you're ready for the light to see
Close your eyes
Say goodnight
Count to three
Follow me

[Bridge]
Follow me, fall in love
Follow me, fall in love
Follow me my love
Follow me, fall in love
Follow me, fall in love
Whatcha say, my love?
Follow me, fall in love
Follow me, fall in love
Follow me in love
Follow me, fall in love
Follow me, fall in love
Whatcha say, my love?
Follow me

[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
All of your love is rocking me to sleep
Endlessly
Cradle me
I'll catch you when you fall into a dream
Follow me
Count to three
Say goodnight
Close your eyes
You and me
Meant to be
So go to bed
You sleepyhead
