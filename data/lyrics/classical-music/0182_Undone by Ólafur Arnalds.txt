As we get bigger and bigger
The distance between ourselves and that other
Outside world becomes smaller and smaller
And this world that we are inside
Which seems so huge in the beginning
And so infinitely welcoming
Has become very uncomfortable
And we are obliged to be born
And my father says that birth is so
Chaotic and violent that he’s sure
That the moment of birth, we’re all thinking
“This is it. This is death. This is the end of my life.”
And then we’re born and it’s a surprise
Cause its just the beginningYou might also like
