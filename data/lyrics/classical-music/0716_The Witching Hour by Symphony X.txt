[Verse 1]
It was seven score and sixteen more
A dreadful scene to behold
Marble silhouettes, white statuettes
Forever gaze into time
(Caught in a web between life and death)

[Chorus]
Visions dance throughout the night
In the pale moon light
In the witching hour

[Verse 2]
Haunting minuet, immortal duet
Dance to the waltz of the souls
Stillness falls upon the aging hall
The fading chimes echo midnight
(Caught in a web between life and death, life and death)

[Chorus]
Visions dance throughout the night
In the pale moon light
In the witching hour

[Chorus]
Visions dance throughout the night
In the pale moon light
In the witching hour

Visions dance throughout the night
In the pale moon light
In the witching hour
