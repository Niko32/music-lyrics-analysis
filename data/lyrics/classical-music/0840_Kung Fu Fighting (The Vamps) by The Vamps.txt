Our chi is what we're finding
I know it's a little bit frightening
Oh but it's so enlightening

Before the battle of the fist
Comes the battle of the mind
When you don't know who you are
Just look inside
When we move into the flow
We're always gonna win
So feel the power that you know
Make sure you let it in

Everybody was kung fu fighting
Our chi is what we're finding
I know it's a little bit frightening
Oh but it's so enlightening

And we keep moving with the flow
If you can walk it, you can roll
Hunger for Justice
Let's make it grow
The more you try to take
The less you really have
When it comes to energy
You've got to give it back
