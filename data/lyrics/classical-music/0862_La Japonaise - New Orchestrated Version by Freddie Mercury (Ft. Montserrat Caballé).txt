Yoakega yobikakeru
Kokorono izumiga wakideru
Yumeno yo

I feel the power of a stranger inside me
A force of magic surrounds me
This fountain within me is overflowing

Peaceful and inviting
Beautiful and enticing

Yoake kisetsu yume kibo
Umito hikariga yondeiru

Rising sun will bless my morning with a smile
A magic pearl from the seas
Born in a willow breeze
Loyal friend my guardian angel in the sky
You've served me well all these years
Greeting with both hands trusting with no fears
Till the end
