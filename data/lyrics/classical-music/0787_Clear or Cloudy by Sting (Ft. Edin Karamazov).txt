Clear or cloudy sweet as April showering
Smooth or frowning so is her face to me
Pleased or smiling like mild May, all flowering
When skies blew silk and meadows carpets bee
Her speeches notes of that night bird that singeth
Who thought all sweet, yet jarring notes outringeth
Her speeches notes of that night bird that singeth
Who thought all sweet, yet jarring notes outringeth

[Verse 2]
Her grace like June, when earth and trees bee trimmed
In best attire of complete beauties height
Her love again like summers days be dimmed
With little clouds of doubtful constant faith
Her trust her doubt, like rain and heat in Skies
Gently thundering, she lightning to mine eyes
Her trust her doubt, like rain and heat in Skies
Gently thundering, she lightning to mine eyes

[Verse 3]
Sweet summer spring that breaths life and growing
In weeds as into herbs and flowers
And sees of service divers sorts in sowing
Some happily seeming and some being yours
Rain on your herbs and flowers that truly serve
And let your weeds lack dew and duly starve
Rain on your herbs and flowers that truly serve
And let your weeds lack dew and duly starveYou might also like
