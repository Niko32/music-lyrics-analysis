I feel it coming before it hits the window and shades
Here in the desert it finds me the same time every day
Fully aware I will hurt if I open my eyes
I keep them shut tight and go back to the time

[Chorus]
First light, I still remember
That long drive, through the cold of the winter
There burned a fire, a fire so wild and new
And a deep red, painted across the sky
Made you catch your breath as do the best things in lifе
Your heart beat, moved to rhythm of minе
Mine at first light

[Verse 2]
I opened a letter dated March the 13th, a Sunday
It said you were in love with me, made it quite clear that you'd never felt this way
It's ironic, it's funny when eyes see perfection they cry
But oh if they lose it, if they lose it they die

[Chorus]
First light, I still remember
That long drive, through the cold of the winter
There burned a fire, a fire so wild and new
And a deep red, painted across the sky
Made you catch your breath as do the best things in life
Your heart beat, moved to rhythm of mine
Mine at first light

[Chorus]
First light, can't help but remember that long drive
Watching the embers grow cold
And with eyes red, I choked on the words that were never said
Like strangers we said our goodbyes
At first–

[Verse 3]
No I won't lose you so I stand in the path of the train
And angry, the passengers say that this man is insane
But you come hold me
And say "Why would you leave me you know I'm no good on my own?" (Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah ah-ah-ah)
"Life is too cold to grow old all alone"

[Outro]
But it's all in my mind
And I'll ache if I wake
Be filled with desire
Consumed by years of mistakes
But if I close my eyes
I'm sure you'll be mine
If I close my eyes
I know you'll be mine
Till...
