In the platinum maze
Twilight cathedrals
Spread the system plague
Forging sacred thrones
In the void unseen
Merciless judgement in the church of the machine

I'm the master, looking down from the edge of space and time
Flesh and steel intertwined
I am the future
Sacrifice your soul and succumb to me
Nailed to your faith, you'll believe

Scream and no one hears my pleas
Faceless masses falling to their knees

Bow down
In the platinum maze
Twilight cathedrals
Spread the system plague
Forging sacred thrones in the void unseen
Merciless judgement in the church of the machine

Pyramids in the sky
Playing out their cosmic games
Rulers of us all
Forever cursed we live in pain
Cursed we live in pain
(Cursed we live in pain)

Artificially devised
The destroyer
Fierce intentions flow from a virtual rage
Forever lost and enslaved

Total mesh of soul and steel
Life force under my command
Twisted baptism of fire
Between machine and man

Scream and no one hears my pleas
Faceless masses falling to their knees

Bow down in the platinum maze
Twilight cathedrals spread the system plague
Forging sacred thrones in the void unseen
Merciless judgement in the church of the machine

Bow down in the platinum maze
Twilight cathedrals spread the system plague
Forging sacred thrones in the void unseen
Merciless judgement in the church of the machine
