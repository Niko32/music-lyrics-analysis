Up the staircase, first door to your left
Walls of white, a window, ten-by-ten
A treasure chest of everything I've ever known
Safe inside my childhood home

[Pre-Chorus]
Every record I have ever heard
I know every melody and every word
A little book of every dream I ever had
Sleeping in that twin sized bed

[Chorus]
All of the laughter
All the sleepless nights
Waiting for ever aftеr
Snow falling outside, keeping on the night light

[Pre-Chorus]
Cardboard boxes covеring the floor
Guess I won't be living in here anymore
Take down the posters of the pop stars on the wall
Empty room, it looks so small

[Chorus]
All of the laughter
All the sleepless nights
Waiting for ever after
Snow falling outside, keeping on the night light

[Bridge]
Take down the posters of the pop stars on the wall
Empty room, it feels so small

[Chorus]
All of the laughter
All the sleepless nights
Waiting for ever after
Snow falling outside, keeping on the night light
