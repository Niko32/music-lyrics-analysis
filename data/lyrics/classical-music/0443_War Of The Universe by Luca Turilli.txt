Cosmic terror of the universe
Beware!
Mighty enemies of mystic wars
Angels call
Soon will be born a mortal who will dare
Stars want it fall!

[Interlude]
Tears!
Cosmic!

Tears!
Cosmic!

Tears!
Cosmic!

Tears

[Verse 1]
There between two astral worlds
Lie dark seeds of eternal war
Far beyond the silent hole where
Meteors paint a crystal storm
Through the eons without space
Where swallowed is the concept:
Time
Systems burning and colliding
Form the chaos, dark and light

Black holes (Ooo-ooo-oooh)
Comets
Blazing thunders
Fragments of the divine born

[Chorus]
War of the Universe
Of cosmic energies
Of phantoms riding
The genesis of all
Sons of the Universe
Forever fighting
Through every age
Condemned to face this
Long holy war

[Interlude]
(Tears!)
Cosmic!

Tears!
Cosmic!

Tears!
Cosmic!
Tears

[Verse 2]
Parallax of suns create
Geometry of moons unborn
Spread the knowledge of the creatures
Between curious there and not

[Pre-Chorus]
Comets' riders (Ooo-ooo-oooh)
Astral fighters
Heroes of celestial shores

[Chorus]
War of the Universe
Of cosmic energies
Of phantoms riding
The genesis of all
Sons of the Universe
Forever fighting
Through every age
Condemned to face this
Long holy war

[Refrain]
Cosmic terror of the universe
Beware!
Mighty enemies of mystic wars
Angels call!
Soon will be born a mortal who will dare
Stars want it fall!

The war
That will be known for
Condemned to avenge this known world
