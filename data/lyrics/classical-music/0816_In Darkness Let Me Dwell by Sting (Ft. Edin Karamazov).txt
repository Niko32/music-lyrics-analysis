In darkness, let me dwell, the ground, the ground shall sorrow be
The roof despair, to bar all, all cheerful light from me
The walls of marble black, that moistened, that moistened and still shall weep, still, shall weep
My music, my music hellish, hellish jarring sounds, jarring, jarring sounds to banish, banish friendly sleep
Thus, wedded to my woes, and bedded in my tomb
Oh, let me live in dying, oh let me live in, let me live in, live in dying
'Til death, 'til death do come
'Til death, 'til death do come
'Til death, 'til death do come

[Outro]
