I am the snowflake in the winter evening
I am the low and high
I am the birth and death
I am your final breath
I am the one that gave you life and freedom
Choosing your own way

Everything you've ever known
Every seed that you have sown
Came from me, I made you
My creation is supreme
No mistakes in God's great perfect cosmic play
This is all my perfect dream

I am the beginning and the end of time
I am the alpha, I am the omega
I am the alpha I am the omega
My whole creation stands before me tonight

I am the day and night
I am the mirage
I am the fear and anger
I am the dark and light
I am the echo
I am the shadow, I am a star that guides you, Until the end of time
I am a familiar stranger
You might also likeEvery seed that you have sown
Everything you've ever known
My creation is supreme
Came from me, I made you
This is all my perfect dream
No mistakes in God's great perfect cosmic play
I am the alpha, I am the omega

I am the beginning and the end of time
I am the alpha I am the omega
I am the alpha, I am the omega
My whole creation stands before me tonight
I am the alpha I am the omega
I am the beginning and the end of time
My whole creation stands before me tonight
