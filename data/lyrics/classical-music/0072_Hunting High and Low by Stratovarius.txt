I feel the wind in my hair
And it's whispering, telling me things
Of the storm that is gathering here
Full of power I'm spreading my wings

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm leaving my worries behind
Feel the freedom of body and mind
I have started my journey
I'm drifting away with the wind, I go

[Chorus]
I am hunting high and low
Diving from the sky above
Looking for more and more once again
I'm hunting high and low
Sometimes I may win, sometimes I'll lose
Its just a game that I play

[Verse 2]
After the storm there's a calm
Through the clouds shines the ray of the sun
I am carried from all of my harm
There is no one that I can't outrun
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm leaving my worries behind
Feel the freedom of body and mind
I have started my journey
I'm drifting away with the wind, I go

[Chorus]
I am hunting high and low
Diving from the sky above
Looking for more and more once again
I'm hunting high and low
Sometimes I may win, sometimes I'll lose
Its just a game that I play

[Chorus]
I am hunting high and low
Diving from the sky above
Looking for more and more once again
I'm hunting high and low
Sometimes I may win, sometimes I'll lose
Its just a game that I play

I am hunting high and low
Diving from the sky above
Looking for more and more once again
I'm hunting high and low
Sometimes I may win, sometimes I'll lose
Its just a game that I play (fading out)
