Little darling, it's been a long cold lonely winter
Little darling, it feels like years since it's been here

[Chorus: Jacob]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say, oh
It's all right

[Verse 2: dodie]
Little darling, the smiles are returning to their faces
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been here

[Chorus: dodie]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say
It's all right

[Interlude: Jacob]
Everybody near and far
Sing that rainbow all night long
Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle

[Bridge: Both and (Jacob Collier)]
Here it comes
Here it comes (Come home)
Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes (Djesse has a sky like a merry-go-round, baby)
Here it comes
Here it comes
Here it comes

Little darling, I feel the ice is slowly melting
Little darling, it seems like years since it's been clear

[Chorus: Jacob Collier & Both]
Here comes the sun
Here comes the sun, and I say, oh
It's all right

[Post-Chorus: dodie]
It's all right
It's all right, it's all right
It's all right
One, two, three, four!
