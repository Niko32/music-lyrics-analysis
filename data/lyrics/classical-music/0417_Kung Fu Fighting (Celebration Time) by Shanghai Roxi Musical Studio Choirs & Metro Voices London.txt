每一个人都 功夫在身
努力寻找气之魂
虽然它有时 会让人慌神
却点亮 我的心灯

Everybody was Kung fu fighting
Our Chi is what we're finding
I know it is a little bit frightening
Oh but it's so enlightening
Before the battle of the fist
Comes the battle of the mind
When you don't know who you are
Just look inside
When we move into the flow
We're always gonna win
So feel the Power
And let it in
Woah ho ho oh
Kung Fu Fighting
Woah ho ho oh
What we're finding
Woah ho ho oh
Little bit Frightening
Woah ho ho oh
So Enlightening
Everybody was Kung fu fighting
