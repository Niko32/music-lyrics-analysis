Keep it down, so I can win the loot!

[OWEN]
Try, I will, but I still got to fart. (loudly) No, toot!

[HEATHER & NOAH]
Shhhh!

[HEATHER]
Toot on, but you're still out of luck
You suck the lemon chuck

[GWEN]
Wait till you’re voted out for being such a lout!

[COURTNEY]
I'll dance a jig when Chris shoves you out the plane!

[ALEJANDRO]
When you don't hold back and lead the pack
Truly there is nothing stopping you, you, you

[LESHAWNA]
Swimming in your eyes
It’s butterflies
And suddenly there's nothing I can't do. Sorry, Harold

Wait, something's itching in my brain!
Someone's back in the game!
My former flame!
And Tyler's your name!
You're Tyler just the same!
Oh, Tyler, Tyler, Tyler, Tyler back you came

[TYLER (spoken)]
You remember me? Ha! She remembers me! YEEEEEESSSSSSSSS!!
