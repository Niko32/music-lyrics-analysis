Morning breaks beyond the night
And she's a world away
Through crowded streets
This quiet hooded stranger makes her way

[Faythe]
Please, excuse me
Sir, can you help me?
Where can I find this man?

[Villager]
Sorry, can't speak
Someone is waiting

[Faythe]
Yes, I understand

[Narrator]
As her will starts to fade
And all but disappears
Like a ghost, suddenly a boy is standing there
And all is clear

[Faythe]
I'm your friend
Trust me, don't be scared
I am looking for your father and I promise I can help
Now take my hand, we haven't time to spare
You might also like[Narrator]
Hopeful and innocent, sensing no danger
He sees humanity behind the stranger's eyes
Her true identity
Will be revealed when she sheds her disguise

[Faythe]
My intentions are faithful!
There's a chance we can still end this game
I'd be forever grateful
To see him once again

[Arhys]
You dare to stand before my eyes!
You're one of them, why would I trust you?

[Faythe]
It's not like that, I can't go back!
Hope fades away with each passing second

Lost in this moment
Is where I want to stay
This can't be broken, we need to find a way Gabriel!

I would wait a lifetime
Just to see your face
But all we have is one more day
[Gabriel]
I remember your father was moved by my song
I know when he sees we're united that he'll understand
We will walk this road together
We will face this hand in hand
With music and love on our side we can't lose this fight

Tomorrow our dream comes alive
