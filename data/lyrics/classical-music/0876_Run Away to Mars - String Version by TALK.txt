Your colour's fading
'Cause I kept you waiting
And it's a wild, wild world
And you're a wild, wild girl

[Pre-Chorus]
Our sun's still shining, but it seems half the size
And it's a wild, wild world out here
Before my time runs out

[Chorus]
What if I run away to Mars?
Would you find me in the stars?
Would you miss me in the end if I run out of oxygen?
When I run away to Mars

[Verse 2]
I can't tell which way's home
I've been gone for so long
It's an empty world up here
Whoa-oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I skip stones and wonder how long 'til I'm discovered
It's a quiet life up here
Before my time runs out
You might also like[Chorus]
What if I run away to Mars?
Would you find me in the stars?
Would you miss me in the end if I run out of oxygen?
When I run away to Mars

[Bridge]
Three, two, onе, I miss you
Oh, oh-oh-oh
I'm sorry I got issues

[Chorus]
What if I run away to Mars?
Would you find me in the stars?
Would you miss mе in the end if I run out of oxygen?
When I run away to Mars
