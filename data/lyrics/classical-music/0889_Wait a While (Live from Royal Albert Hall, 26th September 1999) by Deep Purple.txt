[Verse 1]
Wait before you go
And you will know, what I am feeling as you leave
I understand, your need for some time
Some solitude

[Chorus]
Wait a while, before you go
You should know by now, my heart belongs to you

[Verse 2]
I know that you must leave
And I can see, that it's not easy for you
Now that I'll be here, I know that my soul
Is always near you

[Chorus]
Wait a while before you go
You should know by now I love you and so I will wait a while for you

[Bridge]
Shake the wine and the leaves start falling
Spill the wine and all our dreams come tumbling down
All around
You might also likeThe sands of time are slipping through my fingers
You and I, still the memories linger on
And on

[Verse 3]
Now I know if I can only let go
And wait a while, you'll be here again with me
The same old friends we've always been

[Chorus]
Wait a while before you go
You should know by now I love you and so I will wait a while
Wait a while
Wait a while
For you
For you
You
