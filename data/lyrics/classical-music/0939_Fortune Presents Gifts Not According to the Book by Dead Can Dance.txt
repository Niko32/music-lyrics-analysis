In distributing honours and possessions
She gives awards to some
And penitent's cloaks to others

[Refrain]
When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles

[Verse 2]

Of his cottage and goat pen
And to whomever she fancies
The lamest goat has born two kids

When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles

[Verse 3]
Because in a village a poor lad
Has stolen one egg
He swings in the sun
And another gets away with a thousand crimes

[Refrain]
When you expect whistles it's flutes
When you expect flutes it's whistles
