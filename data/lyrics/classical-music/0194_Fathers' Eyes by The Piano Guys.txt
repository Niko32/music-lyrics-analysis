Hush, my child
As the night calls for your sleep
Rest your head
As I place you in His keep
I don't have the strength to do this alone
So I pray that He will guide you back home

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Through a father's eyes
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Through a father's eyes

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Through a father's eyes

[Verse 2]
Hush, my child
As the night calls for your sleep
Rest your head
As I place you in His keep
Through a father's eyes
Through a father's eyes
You might also like[Outro]
Only through our Father's eyes
