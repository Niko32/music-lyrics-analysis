Dies irae, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Teste David cum Sybilla
(Teste David) cum Sybilla
(Teste David) cum Sybilla

[Verse 1]
Gothic is that enormous portal
That leads to the grey wide hall
The masterwork of dark art
So holy to have...

[Pre-Chorus]
Fear of heavens carved in a wild frame
So attractive, drug for my brain in awe
Rex tremendae majestatis
Cum salvando salvas gratis
Pains of ancient, genial talent

[Chorus 1]
And I feel all around
This wonderful sound
Of my divine abstraction
Stendhal old vision
Paint my new syndrome
Sacred hidden truth
Dies irae, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla

Angels and perfect straight lines
Gargoyles protecting from old evil
Now trapped in naked marble
That rides from crypts to...

[Pre-Chorus]
Fear of heavens carved in a wild frame
So attractive, drug for my brain in awe
Rex tremendae majestatis
Cum salvando salvas gratis
Gems of silent, great creation

[Chorus 2]
Mighty voice of the gods
Reveal in the hall
The sacred frames of angels
Ancient cathedral
Speak of your era
Capture my free mind
Dies irae, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla

[Refrain]
Dies irae, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla, villa
[Guitar Solo]

[Refrain]
Dies irae, dies irae
Dies illa, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Dies irae, dies irae
Dies illa, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla

[Chorus 1]
And I feel all around
This wonderful sound
Of my divine abstraction
Stendhal old vision
Paint my new syndrome
Sacred hidden truth
Dies irae, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla

[Post-Chorus]
Dies irae, dies illa
Solvet saeclum in favilla
Teste David cum Sybilla
(Teste David) cum Sybilla
(Teste David) cum Sybilla
