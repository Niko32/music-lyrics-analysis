Love, hold my hand
Help me see you with the dawn
That those that have left
Are not gone

[Verse 2]
But they carry on
As stars looking down
As nature's sons
And daughters of the heavens

[Chorus]
You will not ever be forgotten by me
In the precession of the mighty stars
Your name is sung and tattooed now on my heart
Here I will carry, carry, carry you
Forever

[Verse 3]
You have touched my life
So that now cathedrals of sound are singing
Are singing

[Verse 4]
The waves have come to walk with you
To where you will live in the Land of Youth
Land of Youth
You might also like[Chorus]
You will not ever be forgotten by me
In the precession of the mighty stars
Your name is sung and tattooed now on my heart
Here I will carry, carry, carry you
Here I will carry, carry, carry you
Forever
