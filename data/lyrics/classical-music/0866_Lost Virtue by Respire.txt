Shine like sarcoma

Dominion of rust and ruin
Rotting still, rotten still
Dorsal vestige rise, resist

Catch them proudly all laugh into the flames

You can feel it in the air
You can hear it in the static
A lineage of slaughter
Use and consume

You can hear it in the air
You can feel it in the static
Our lineage of laughing into the flames

How fitting it will be to be absolved of this
Archaic tragedy of desire and death

All might must fall
As night turns dawn
Eclipsed by time

Shed these bounds (if it’s all wrong)
Air your light (let it all burn)
When we’re gone (it goes on)
You might also likeAs nothing
Totality
