Sittin' on the bleachers alone
Wonderin’ where it went wrong
The ringin' of bells and the sound of the tone
I haven't heard it in years
Walkin’ in the rain past your home
Feet soakin' wet, four missed calls on your phone
Light in the window of where I belong, but
I see two shadows up there

[Chorus: d4vd & Laufey, d4vd]
So, this is how it feels
To fall in love with you
To always think of you
To always dream of you
Yes it hurts so much to fall in love with

[Verse 2: Laufey]
Sorry for leaving like that
You don't deserve to get caught in my mess
Loving you is just so difficult
I don't know how I should tell you that
I've fallen for somebody еlse
Happened so quickly I lost mysеlf
A shadow of you drifts along by my window
Or did I imagine that?
You might also like[Chorus: d4vd & Laufey, d4vd]
So, this is how it feels
To fall in love with you
To always think of you
To always dream of you
Yes it hurts so much to fall in love with you

[Bridge: d4vd]
So if this is how it feels
Tell me if our love is real
There's some type of strange appeal  to the way it was so effortless
I, I cannot help it

[Chorus: d4vd & Laufey]
This is how it feels
To fall in love with you
To always think of you
To always dream of you
Yes it hurts so much to fall in love with you
