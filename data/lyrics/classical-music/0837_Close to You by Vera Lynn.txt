Close to you
I will always stay
Close to you
For you’re far away
You will always be near
As though you were here by my side
No matter where in my dreams I find you there

[Verse 2]
Close to me
Sharing your caress
And you’ll see
All my happiness
Wherever you go my heart will go to
What can I do
It only wants to be close to you

[Verse 1]
Close to you
I will always stay
Close to you
For you’re far away
You will always be near
As though you were here by my side
No matter where in my dreams I find you there
You might also like[Verse 2]
Close to me
Sharing your caress
And you’ll see
All my happiness
Wherever you go my heart will go to
What can I do
It only wants to be close to you
