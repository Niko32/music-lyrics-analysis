So all you people give freely
Make welcome inside your homes, woo!
Thank God you people give freely
Don't turn your back
On the lesson of the Lord
All prime ministers (Yeah)
And majesty around the world
Open your eyes, look, touch and feel
Rule with your heart
(Rule with your heart)
Live with your conscience
(Live with your conscience)
(Love) Love, love and be
(Love) Love, and be free
We're all God's people
(We're all God's people)

[Verse]
Gotta face up, better grow up
Gotta stand tall and be strong
Gotta face up, better grow up
Gotta face up, better grow up
Gotta stand tall and be strong
Gotta face up, better grow up
We're all God's people
(Gotta face up, better grow up)
(Gotta face up, better grow up)
Yeah, yeah

Yes, yeah
Yes, there was this magic light
I said to myself
I'd better go to bed
And have an early night
Then I, then I, then I
Then I went into a dream

Rule with your heart
And live with your conscience

We're all God's people give freely (Yeah)
Make welcome inside your homes
Let us be thankful, he's so incredible
