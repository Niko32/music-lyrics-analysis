The good from all spread evenly
No lords, no slaves
We are tolerant and brave
Forward unafraid
And thus I take your hand
As one we stand
Dignity!
Unity!
Togetherness in this land!

Times undone we stayed out of the sun
The wealth of all accrued to one
And fear and hate filled our overflowing plate
In the dark, we'd wait
And then a crash, a storm, a brand new golden morn
Win again!
Begin again!
This fine never-ending dawn!

Dream, oh dream
The wonders you have seen
The place you are and whos you've been
The simple plan
The equality of man
Each gives all they can
So save your words of doom
Leave your terror and your gloom
Educate!
Liberate!
Emerge from your broken womb!
You might also likeWe stand free of inequality
The good from all spread evenly
No lords, no slaves
We are tolerant and brave
Forward unafraid
And thus I take your hand
As one we stand
Dignity!
Unity!
Togetherness in this land!
