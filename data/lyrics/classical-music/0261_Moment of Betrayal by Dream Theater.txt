[Verse 1: Gabriel]
Brace yourself, my brother
I have breaking news!
The Noise Machines lie still tonight
There's no time to lose

No more threats of bloodshed
No more pain and fear!
Ravenskill will brave the storm
Our victory is near

[Pre-Chorus 1: Gabriel]
You are acting very strange!
Nervous and on edge
I will be a voice for change!
Brother, give me strength!

[Chorus: Arhys]
Burning rose, secrets sold
Moment of betrayal
Kiss of death, blood revenge
Moment of betrayal

[Verse 2: Arhys]
I have sworn to live and die
By the warrior's code
Never leave a man behind
May God redeem my soul
You might also likeI will give you what you need
My brother for my son
Guilt and shame will burden me
Until my days are done

[Pre-Chorus 2: Arhys]
Meet me tonight where the stars touch the sky
He'll be alone there with nowhere to hide

[Chorus: Arhys]
Burning rose, secrets sold
Moment of betrayal
Kiss of death, blood revenge
Moment of betrayal

[Bridge: Arhys]
He will be defenseless
I'll look on, say I put up a fight
There will be no witness
They will call you a hero tonight

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Arhys]
Burning rose, secrets sold
Moment of betrayal
Kiss of death, blood revenge
Moment of betrayal
[Outro: Arhys]
Threats and lies, changing sides
Moment of betrayal
Risking all, savior's fall
Moment of betrayal

[Instrumental Outro]
