I hear footsteps closing in
I recognize them from my early days
The times are different the image remains the same
Repeating backflashes remembering the name

[Pre-Chorus]
Approaching visions of things
I can't recall
A familiar smile awakes the pain

[Chorus]
Unkept promises
The night awaits
The act of confidence
The kiss of Judas
I feel the lips on my cheek
The kiss of Judas
Haunts me once again

[Verse 2]
In your private chamber you're all alone
The well earned silver pieces falling to the floor
The flame of the candle casting movement to the wall
Your eyes filled with guilt keep staring at the door
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Approaching visions of things
I can't recall
A familiar smile awakes the pain

[Chorus]
Unkept promises
The night awaits
The act of confidence
The kiss of Judas
I feel the lips on my cheek
The kiss of Judas
Haunts me once again

[Chorus]
Unkept promises
The night awaits
The act of confidence
The kiss of Judas
I feel the lips on my cheek
The kiss of Judas
Haunts me once again

Unkept promises
The night awaits
The act of confidence
The kiss of Judas
I feel the lips on my cheek
The kiss of Judas
Haunts me once again
