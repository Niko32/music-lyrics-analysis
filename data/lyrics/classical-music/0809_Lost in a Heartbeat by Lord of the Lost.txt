But I'm so good in playing this game
I've played the game all day all night
A million times I cross the line
But in the end just anguish remains

When everything's destroyed
We find a heart inside the void

Is it you? Is it me?
Is it true what I feel?
Or am I just lost in a heartbeat?

Is it you? Is it me?
I want to believe
I feel like I'm lost in a heartbeat

Is it as fake as you are true?
Is love as great as life is cruel?
We're lost in a heartbeat
When everything's destroyed
We find a heart inside the void
Left behind
Is it yours or is it mine?

Imagine you were me, did you ever try to see?
Can you smell the guilt, the taste of poison?
Whatever happens I'll be here
Trying to be a better man
Even if my heart is frozen
You might also likeIs it you? Is it me?
Is it true what I feel?
Or am I just lost in a heartbeat?
Is it you? Is it me?
I want to believe
I feel like I'm lost in a heartbeat

Is it as fake as you are true?
Is love as great as life is cruel?
We're lost in a heartbeat
When everything's destroyed
We find a heart inside the void
Left behind
Is it yours or is it mine?

When everything's destroyed
We find a heart inside the void

I'm lost in a heartbeat
I'm lost in a heartbeat
