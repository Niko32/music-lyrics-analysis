I'm not a maestro
I don't have a direction
So, what would I aim for?
It's not like I'm conductin'
Gave all my knowledge
If I've learned anything
I judge my flaws and I
Will not call it a night
Show must go on
But do not applaud
Where do I belong?
It is right here, right here

[Verse 1]
It's showtime, and I'm due mine
You won't close the curtains on me this time
Got the spotlight and I'm gon' shine
Spent my darkest hours on the sidelines
Sensin' hatred when they commentatin'
Tried to shake things up and that ain't stage fright
I'ma take flight
Grand finale is I'm a perfect 10
I'm a puppeteer pullin' strings tight
I don't disappear and the secret is:
I'm conductin' right in front of plain sight
You'll come to find
I'ma mastermind behind the universal language
Woken wide
Never utilized
Gone beyond the measure, read between the lines
'Cause I feel alive
Used my voice and now these riffs are rippin' through the mic
You might also like[Verse 2]
Just a performer with composure
Who's approached and provoked
A broad clause at an audience that's responded with the cold shoulder
On short notice
Anticipated from the get-go
Let's get goin'
I'm closin'
Gathering up all the components
Supposin', it's showbiz
I'ma leave it on the high note
Orchestrate, compose and guide you
Open the doors and go right through
Do this on a daily basis
Take the stage and then I grace it
You get out what you put in
And this is more than entertainment

[Bridge]
Respect don't come often in a world full of haters
But that's music to my ears 'cause I don't have to gain it
A bow in my hands is a brush to a painter
Arranging my placement
Arranging my placement
Respect don't come often in a world full of haters
But that's music to my ears 'cause I don't have to gain it
A bow in my hands is a brush to a painter
Arranging my placement
Arranging my placement
[Verse 3]
I stand before you as humbled and honored
Been on a roll, voluble
Know who you're talkin' to
Do I got to go in detail?
Identities aren't always unveiled
There's lessons to be taught
That is what I'm tryna teach them
And you learn something new every day
Your mind is an instrument, don't let them play it
I know, at events, it can get you to switch your mood
What I'm portrayed as depends on your point of view

[Chorus]
I'm not a maestro
I don't have a direction
So, what would I aim for?
It's not like I'm conductin'
Gave all my knowledge
If I've learned anything
I judge my flaws and I
Will not call it a night
Show must go on
But do not applaud
Where do I belong?
It is right here, right here
