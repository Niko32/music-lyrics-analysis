My Bonnie lies over the ocean
My Bonnie lies over the sea
My Bonnie lies over the ocean
Oh bring back my Bonnie to me

[Chorus]
Bring back, Bring back
Bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
Bring back, bring back
Oh bring back my Bonnie to me

[Verse 2]
Last night as I lay on my pillow
Last night as I lay on my bed
Last night as I lay on my pillow
I dreamt that my Bonnie was dead

[Chorus]
Bring back, bring back
Bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
Bring back, bring back
Oh bring back my Bonnie to me

[Verse 3]
The winds have blown over the ocean
The winds have blown over the sea
The winds have blown over the ocean
And brought back my Bonnie to me
You might also like[Chorus]
Bring back, bring back
Bring back my Bonnie to me, to me
Bring back, bring back
Oh bring back my Bonnie to me

[Outro]
Bring back, bring back, bring back
Bring back my Bonnie to me
