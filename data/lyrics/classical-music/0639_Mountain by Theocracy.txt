I'm searching to find what's beyond each horizon
To the end of one world and on to a new one
Always chasing golden sunsets
I'm struggling out of the depths of the valley
And my weary legs have failed me once again
So I give my broken soul to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And in my weakness is Your strength realized
Consume me in the fire of Your glory once again
And help me rise

[Chorus]
Rise, taking flight
To the zenith of life
Rise to the top of the mountain with You
The world disappears
Into the valley below me
As I'm lost in the glory of You

[Verse 2]
Step by step the climb gets harder
My being weakens as I struggle farther and farther
Flesh is weakness, darkness, sickness
My dreams are shattered, my ambitions crumbled
My will defeated, my spirit humbled once more
I am hopeless, helpless without you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And I must decrease so that You may increase
And when I find you're all I have
I found you're all I need to help me rise

[Chorus]
Rise, taking flight
To the zenith of life
Rise to the top of the mountain with You
The world disappears
Into the valley below me
As I'm lost in the glory of You

[Post-Chorus]
I cannot fight this battle on my own
Have mercy
I'm fallen weakness clothed in flesh and bone
Consume me
I stand in awe of who you are
And what I feel I cannot explain
Forged in the flame, broken again

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Take me to the places I can't go
Transcending
I'm sick of living in the status quo
New Beginning
And when it seems I've given up
On eagle's wings you lift me up again
And this time I know
And this time I know
This time I know
In the end
You carried me
