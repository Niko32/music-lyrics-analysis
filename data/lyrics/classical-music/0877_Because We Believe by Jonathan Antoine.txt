Once in every life
There comes a time
We walk out all alone
And into the light
The moment won't last but then
We remember it again
When we close our eyes

[Chorus]
Like stars across the sky
We were born to shine
All of us here because we believe

[Verse 2]
Walk to the light
And never look back
And always remember your dreams and your hopes
But then we remember it again
When we close our eyes

[Chorus]
Like stars across the sky
We were born to shine
All of us here because we believe
You might also like[Outro]
Keep on trying
When you are alive
Like stars across the sky
We were born to shine
You 'll shine
