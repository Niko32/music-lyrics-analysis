I've never been in love before
Now all at once it's you
It's you forevermore
I've never been in love before
I thought my heart was safe
I thought I knew the score

[Pre-Chorus]
But this is wine
It's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish song
And out my song must pour

[Chorus]
So please forgive this helpless haze I'm in
I've really never been
In love before

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
But this is wine
It's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish song
And out my song must pour
You might also like[Chorus]
So please forgive this helplеss haze I'm in
I've really nеver been
In love before

[Outro]
I've really never been
In love before
