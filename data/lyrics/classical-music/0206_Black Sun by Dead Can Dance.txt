Murder!
I've seen the eyes of the living dead
It's the same game, survival
The great mass play a waiting game
Embalmed, crippled
Dying in fear of pain
All sense of freedom gone

Black sun in a white world
Like having a black sun in a white world

I have a son, his name is Eden
It's his birthright beyond estranged times

Give me 69 years
Another season in this hell
It's all sex and death
As far as eyes can tell
Like Prometheus we are bound
Chained to this rock of a brave new world
Our god-forsaken lot

And I feel that's all we have ever needed to know
'Til worlds end and the seas run cold

Another season in this hell
There is sex and death
In mother nature's plans

Like Prometheus we are bound
Chained to this rock of a brave new world
Our god-forsaken lot
