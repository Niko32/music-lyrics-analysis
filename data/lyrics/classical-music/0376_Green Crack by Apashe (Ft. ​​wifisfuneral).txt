[Pre-Hook: Wifisfuneral]

Cried about this shit
Died up for this shit
Got out for a lick

Water whip a brick

[Verse 1: Wifisfuneral]
Hey, uh, yeah
But where's the object?
I need to stop cuz I'm too astonished
Okay I'm smoking green crack
Inside of the wood is blanca
Told Lil Woadie breath back
The choppa hit like E. Honda
And I'm just high on drugs
Never needed love
I just press my feelings and press my guns
Okay, like
Risk yo' neck, I give you none
Okay, like
The due is part, but I ain't gone
Okay, like
Give you my soul, this shit is tough
Until then
