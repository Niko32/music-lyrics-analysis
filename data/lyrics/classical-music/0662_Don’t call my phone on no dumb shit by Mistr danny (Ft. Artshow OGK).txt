[Verse 2]
Now listen here my old girl keep calling my phone
She want my dick
But i don’t care
I don’t give a fuck
I don’t give her none
And i can hit her up
And still catch a nut
And bounce
Cause i don’t give a fuck

It's been about eight months since i last gave her dick
Plus she keep calling me talking about all that shit
About the hoes i’ve been quote unquote fucking and shit
I said bitch please
Leave me alone

Please stop calling my phone
I wasted all that time with you
You had it all
But it was too good to be true
I guess i shouldn't have hit it that good
Cause you thought i was cheating and lying to you

I always told you the truth
Now you lost me
I'm riding around the dmv with my broski
And we might hit up some hoes on the way home
While we hitting the patron
While we hitting the dab and that strong

I’m relapsing
Cause i'm tryna relax
Not fuss and fight like we did almost every fucking night
Stop calling my phone
Don't call my phone
Stop calling my phone
Don't call my phone on no dumb shit
Yeah
