The ones you touched when you ran past
Me on the way to class
"We're late"
You said
"Come run with me"

But crumpled up and thrown away
I tore apart my heart today
Just ripped to shreds, you saw me then
"Its late"
You said
"Come walk with me"

Moonlight falls upon my windowsill
I watch the world go by
In time
Can you save me from my dreams?

From
Whispers of
The stars aligned
It rises up
And breaks the tide

To prophecies
And valentines
To waking up
In the end times
You might also like
My god its crushing me
Tangled round my body like countless chains
Black seas split by twisted spires
Holding my eyes open, I'm so tired

All my nightmares
They never change but
I'll think of you tonight


I snap awake, another day
Another sleepless night to face alone
Without you by my side
Why can't you just
Why can't you just be mine

But once again
We're only friends
Not even friends, it's just pretend
But in my head's not good enough
Today, I thought
I'll make you mine

Sunlight falls upon your perfect smile
I saw you from afar
Who's she?
Why's your hand on her cheek?

You broke my heart
With a secret kiss
My pillows stained
With teardrops

The voices come
But louder now
With words I do not remember

My god it's crushing me
Tangled round my body like countless chains
Black seas split by twisted spires
Holding my eyes open I'm so tired

And all my nightmares they never change but
I'm wide awake tonight

Suddenly
The routine breaks
The whispers come
And fade away

Two silhouettes
Their shadows tall
You and I
Together after all
My god its you and I
Dancing on the air like new years flames
Under sickly green moonlight
I can see us smiling in the sky

My god I now believe
The coming of the old one sets me free
Black seas split by ryleh spires
Voices entwined together like a choir
All my nightmares they never change but
I'll think of you tonight
