[Hook]
Am I an angel or a devil
I’m only human so I guess both
Am I an angel or a devil
I’m only human so I guess both

[Verse 1]
Godspeed for the last time
My rear view’s like my past life
My demons mad that I’m too fast
Furious when I zoom past
Bite the dust while I dash (Huh)
The villain gets the last laugh (Huh)
Thought I had the white hat
But, I did some dirt, now it’s black
Who want smoke, I got gas
Who gon’ choke, who gon’ gag
Who gon’ boast, who gon’ brag
Who want most of this wrath
When I go to my path

[Hook]
Am I an angel or a devil
I’m only human so I guess both
Am I an angel or a devil
I’m only human so I guess both

[Chorus]
Am I an angel or a devil
The question leaves them unsettled
Heaven’s gates told me: "hell no"
Demons said I ain’t special
Antagonist, watch me meddle
Tell the world, make it tremble
The question leaves them unsettled
Am I an angel or devil

[Pre-Drop]
Guess both!

[Drop]

[Verse 2]
The bond that we build cannot be broke
Kin, these are family ties
Let’s ride 'til the wheels, fall off the road
And reconnect in the sky
The blood that we shed and that we cried
Keeping with us 'til we die
We had a hell of a ride
But now it’s time for goodbye
[Hook]
Am I an angel or a devil
I’m only human so I guess both

[Outro]
Am I an angel or a devil
Am I an angel or a devil
