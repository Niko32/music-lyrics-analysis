Now the scent has left my trail
Who will find me, take care and side with me
Guide me back safely to my home
Where I belong, once more

Where is my star in heaven's bough
Where is my strength, I need it now
Who can save me, lead me to my destiny
Guide me back safely to my home
Where I belong, once more

Who will find me, take care and side with me
Guide me back safely to my home
Where I belong, once more

How can I go on?
