The boy had a way with words, he sang, he moved with grace
He entertained so naturally, no gesture out of place
His road in life was clearly drawn, he didn't hesitate
He played, they saw, he conquered as the master of, as the master of his fate

[Verse 2: Montserrat Caballé]
The girl had an iron soul no-one could recognise
Material ambition that her gentleness disguised
She gave herself to him certain of his fame
Wanted him for luxury, for limelight and his name

[Bridge: Choir]
And then he sang to her

[Chorus 1: Freddie Mercury]
I love you for your silence, I love you for your peace
The still and calm releases that sweep into my soul
That slowly take control

[Chrous 2: Montserrat Caballé]
I love you for your passion, I love you for your fire
The violent desire that burns me in its flame
A love I dare not name

[Verse 3: Choir and Freddie Mercury]
His rise was irresistible (yeah) - he grew into the part
His explanation simply that he suffered for his art
No base considerations of some glittering reward
The prize was knowing that his work was noticed and adored
You might also like[Chorus 1: Choir and Freddie Mercury]
I love you (yes I love you) for your silence, I love you for your peace
The still and calm releases that sweep into my soul
That slowly, slowly takes control

[Verse 4: Choir and Freddie Mercury]
Yes he told the truth (he told the truth), yes he told the truth
Accepting every honour with a masterly display
Of well-rehearsed reluctance to be singled out this way
He started to believe that he was all they said and more (and more)
While she forgot, she forgot the reasons (reasons)
She had wanted him before

[Chorus 1: Choir and Montserrat Caballé]
(I love you) I love you for your passion (for your passion)
I love you for your fire
The violent desire that burns me in its flame (burns me in its flame)
A love I dare not name

[Chorus 1: All]
The still and calm releases (releases)
That sweep into my soul (sweep into my soul)
That slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly)
Slowly (slowly) slowly (slowly) take control

[Verse 5: Freddie Mercury and Montserrat Caballé]
And when at last they fell apart, she wished that she could be
The hardened heart of yesterday, as cynical as he
By changing for the better, she had changed things for the worse
The words that made them happy once now echoed - echoed as a curse
