Release
The sword of Damocles
Just release it
To the authorities

[Verse 1]
We have been given
The same fortune cookies
You and I and
All of our progenies

[Verse 2]
Raise kindness
Above all else
Avoid the books of
Hatred behind the shelves

[Verse 3]
I will caress your
Caress your curly hair
With affection
Many a good reason to cut off your head
Then and there

[Chorus 2]
Release
Release
The Sword of Damocles
Release
Just release it
Release it
I’m begging
I'm begging
You on my knees
I'm begging you on my knees
You might also like[Verse 4]
There is no reason
Release
To hide it from the sun
Release
I am a tyrant
Tyrant, release it
Trust me, you are not the one and only
And trust me, you are not the one and only
And trust me, you are not the one and only
Lonely person

[Chorus 3]
Release
The sword of Damocles
Release
The sword of Damocles
Just release it
Cut the thread
Why don’t you please
