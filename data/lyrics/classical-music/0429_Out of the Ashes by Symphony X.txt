Beyond the gate there is a bed of snakes where evil lays
Oh, I hear laughter
I forged the iron bars that someday will imprison me

Ooh, mother will you help me (ooh)
Mother will you help me (ooh)
To find a reason to go on

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Out of the ashes of my youth I rise a man (and through the eyes)
And through the eyes of truth I finally understand (ahh)
The way

I've been beaten with his words and whipped with his lies
He will not break me down, no matter how hard he tries
Pray for my lost soul
Out of control the storm inside me rages on and on and on

Mother will you help me (ooh)
Mother will you help me (ooh)
To find a reason to go on

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Out of the ashes of my youth I rise a man (and through the eyes)
And through the eyes of truth I finally understand (ahh)
The way
