Who will become the house's queen?
It is me Fern Brady, me Fern Brady
I'm the rightful queen
Dilapidated house filled with mystery
Whoever bloody knows what we will see
Only one contestant will achieve
The height of victory
And the tasks were serendipitous
They were gift to the Taskmistress
All the other contestants
They were boot-licking sycophants
Dara's a big bald imbecile
Mr. Kearns is obsequious
And Sarah & Munya are losers
And I'll stamp on their toesYou might also like
