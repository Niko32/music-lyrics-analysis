Would that I were a jewel
A shattered jewel
That all my shining brilliants
Might fall at thy feet
Thou dark one

[Verse 2]
Would that I were a garment
A shimmering, silken garment
That all my folds
Might wrap about thy body
Absorb thy body
Hold and hide thy body
Thou dark one

[Verse 3]
Would that I were a flame
But one sharp, leaping flame
To annihilate thy body
Thou dark oneYou might also like
