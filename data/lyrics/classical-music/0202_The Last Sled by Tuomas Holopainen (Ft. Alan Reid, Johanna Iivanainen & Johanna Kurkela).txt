"There’s gold, and it’s haunting and haunting;
It’s luring me on as of old;
Yet it isn’t the gold that I’m wanting
So much as just finding the gold
It’s the great, big, broad land ’way up yonder
It’s the forests where silence has lease;
It’s the beauty that thrills me with wonder
It’s the stillness that fills me with peace."

[Verse 1]
The great, broad land 'way up yonder
Haunting him as of old
Yet, it ain't the gold itself, so much as finding the gold

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Farewell, White Agony Creek
Farewell, the three long years
Can't leave behind what's in this sled

[Chorus]
Things we lost
The things we couldn't share
Another rainbow's end
Another memory
Fortuna favet fortibus
Hold on to all that's dear to you
As the last sled to Dawson finally arrives
You might also like[Verse 2]
The stillness that fills him with peace
The beauty of the wild
Rainbow's end with golden dreams
Starlit sky and coffee & beans

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Farewell, White Agony Creek
Farwell, the three spring thaws
One day I will return to you

[Chorus]
Things we lost
The things we couldn't share
Another rainbow's end
Another memory
Fortuna favet fortibus
Hold on to all that's dear to you
As the last sled to Dawson finally arrives
