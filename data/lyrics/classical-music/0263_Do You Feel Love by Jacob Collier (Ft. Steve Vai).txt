Love
Do you love?
Do you feel the
Do you feel the love?

[Verse 1]
You don’t wanna get too close ‘cause I feel dangerous
You like it
Your heart beat is strong now
Whenever you’re with me, I get so mysterious
You want it (I want it)
There’s a tingling in your fingers

[Verse 2]
You can take off your clothes, I’m so precarious
I like it
My heart beat is strong now (Wiggle, wiggle, wiggle)
I never really do this but I’m so delirious
And I like it
Oh, that tingling in my fingers, now

[Refrain]
Love you
I want you
Got-got-got-got to get you
Love you
I want you
Got-got-got-got to get you

I don’t wanna say too much but you’re spontaneous
I like it
My heart beat is strong now
Whenever I’m with you, you get so enrapturous
I want it
There’s a tingling in my fingers

[Verse 4]
You promised you would never kiss me but it’s glorious (Oh, oh)
You like it (I like it)
Your heart beat is strong now
I never really do this but tonight I’m dangerous (So dangerous)
You can feel it (You know I can feel it)
That tingling in your fingers
