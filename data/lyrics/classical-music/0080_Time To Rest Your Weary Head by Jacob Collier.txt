The time has come for me to tell you
All  the things I really feel about you
'Cause  lately time's been moving on
And every day we seem to grow a little older, too
The more I think of you the less I seem
To  know the way I feel about you
And  all I think is all I know
And all I know is all I want to think about is you

[Verse 2]
I  used to think I knew it all
And that the love you gave was mine for keeping
I guess I cared too much for you back then
To see the simple magic of it all
I  long to see the things we saw
When we were young and could not see so clearly
When all the world was just a blur of coloured lines
That I'd trace most sincerely back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'd say

[Chorus]
"Time to rest your weary head
Take your wings and go to bed
I know you want to know it all, my darling"
And I'd say
"Set me down and rock me
Rock me to sleep"
You might also like[Verse 3]
I see the sparkle in your eyes
You say I'm beautiful and I believe you
And I will never feel more beautiful
Than when I'm wide awake beside you
I'll wander far and wide and wonder
How it feels to fall in love with someone
Without the need to show her everything I've learnt
About the world since you've been gone

[Pre-Chorus]
And you'd say

[Chorus]
"Time to rest your weary head
Take your wings and go to bed
I know you want to show it all, my darling"
And I'd say
"Set me down and rock me
Rock me to sleep"

[Verse 4]
There was a time it seemed the time itself
Was free and would go on forever
Wanted to cling to it but now I see
Its fading is its greatest treasure, ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
And you would say

[Chorus]
"Time to rest my weary head
Take my wings and go to bed
I know you want to feel it all, my darling"
And I'd say
"Sit me down and rock me, oh
Sit me down and rock me, oh darling
Sit me down and rock me
Rock me to sleep"
