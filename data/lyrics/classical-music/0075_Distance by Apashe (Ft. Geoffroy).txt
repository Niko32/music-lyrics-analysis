Mm, mm
Mm, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't even know what you like and you don't like
You don't even know what you like and you don't like

[Chorus]
Oh, 'cause I never really wanted you to notice
And I, distance myself from you
You don't even know what you like and you don't like
Oh, guess you never even wanted to know this
And I, distance myself from you
You don't even know what you like and you don't like

[Build]
You don't even know what you like and you don't like

[Drop]
Given my love to you (Shouldn't)
Given my love to you
Given my love to you
Given my love to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Mm, mm
You don't even know what you like and you don't like
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, guess you never even wanted to know this
And I, distance myself from you
You don't even know what you like and you don't like

[Build]
You don't even know what you like and you don't like

[Drop]
Given my love to you
Given my love to you (Shouldn't)

[Outro]
Mm, mm
Mm, mm
