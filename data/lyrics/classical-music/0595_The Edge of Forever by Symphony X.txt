Lie in pieces on the floor
Finds himself in an empty room
Her voice calls out to him
He opens the door, but there's no one there
No one there

Draped in a silken glow of moonlight through the mist I see
A lucid cathedral appears to me
Pray for a glimpse of touch of sunlight chain our shadow down
Night settles in, my love
You never make a sound
You never make... a sound

Love is flowing from my fingertips
Never in control of this domain
All around me, my essence lay
Watch the vultures circle through the pouring rain

Close your eyes and try to remember
Discordant lullabies of days gone by
Close your eyes on the edge of forever
A chance to dream, fast asleep your nightmare ends

As the walls converge around me
Castles crumbling down
Everything is not as it seems to be
You might also likeOnce more
I feel I must return
No more
Will my soul burn
Dawn breaks the ground, my love
And with it you fade away...

Close your eyes and try to remember
Discordant lullabies of days gone by
Close your eyes on the edge of forever
A chance to dream, fast asleep your nightmare ends

Close your eyes and try to remember
Discordant lullabies of days gone by
Close your eyes on the edge of forever
A chance to dream, fast asleep your nightmare ends

Oh My love, Live Again!
