With all the taste I desire
It's all good if you let me dive
With some sharks on the ground

You lose your routine
You lose your routine
You lose your routine
'Cause I found my path

What the hell are you trying?
Now I know there is something more
What happened to you?
Still standing on my path
Are you still denying?
Now I know there is something more
That this is the truth
It's all in you!

What do you come for?
What did you expect to find?
What do you live for?
What did you expect to find?
What do you live for?
What did you expect to find?
What do you live for?
What did you expect to find?

And foundless all my fears
Stop running back to old times
Stop running back to old times

You lose your routine...
'Cause I found my path

What the hell are you trying?
Now I know there is something more
What happened to you?
Still standing on my path
Are you still denying?
Now I know there is something more
That this is the truth
It's all in you!
