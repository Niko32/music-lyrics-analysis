Our daily dead!
Curse the son for this sight

Lie strewn upon the ground
Can we not offer humility? Humility
Breath hungry, life lost, faith starved
Can we not offer humility?
Can we not offer humility?

Give us this day
Our daily dead
Curse the son for this sight

Lie strewn upon the ground
Can we not offer humility? Humility
Breath hungry, life lost, faith starved
Can we not offer humility?
Can we not offer humility?

Digger dig deep, feel for sights and sounds
Press your ear against the earth, upon the ground

Runner, ride out, against the turning tide
The sun beats down upon the land set aside

Press your ear against the earth, upon the ground

Runner, ride out, against the turning tide
The sun beats down upon the land set aside

Foreboding fates will not cease
Laying my death before me
Arrows split against my hide
I am everyone, everyone in my eyes
Everyone in these eyes
I will witness, witness the Fall of Efrafa!
I will witness, witness the... Fall!

Give us this day!
Our daily dead!
Can we not offer humility?
Humility
