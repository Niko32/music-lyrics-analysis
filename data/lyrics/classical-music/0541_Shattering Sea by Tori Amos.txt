That is not my blood on the bedroom floor
That is not the glass that I threw before
He gets his power from tide and wave
But grains of sand are my domain
His tempest surged an angry flash
Then through my arms formed a sea of glass

[Interlude]

[Bridge]
Shattering sea, closing my eyes
Shattering sea, closing my eyes
Shattering sea, closing my eyes

[Verse 2]
Every line, every curve, every twist
Every turn of every brutal word
Every turn, every line, every twist
Every line, every curve, every twist
Every curve of every brutal word

[Interlude]

[Outro]
That is not my blood on the bedroom floor
That is not the glass that I threw beforeYou might also like
