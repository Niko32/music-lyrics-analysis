I just want to take you home
Call a taxi in the snow
When the driver can't see
Steal a kiss from me

[Pre-Chorus]
Realized I forgot the keys
Think that it was meant to be
Cause we sat outside
You looked in my eyes

[Chorus]
When the sun goes away in the autumn
And the leaves trickle down from the trees
The heat of the summer’s forgotten
You'll be here so lucky for me

[Verse 2]
You don't tell me to shut up
Even when I talk too much
You smile at me
Say, "don’t worry"

[Chorus]
When the sun goes away in the autumn
And the leaves trickle down from the trees
The heat of the summer's forgotten
You'll be here so lucky for me
You might also like[Instrumental Bridge]

[Outro]
You'll be here so lucky for me
