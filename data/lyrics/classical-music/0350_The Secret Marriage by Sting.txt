No earthly church has ever blessed our union
No state has ever granted us permission
No family bond has ever made us two
No company has ever earned commission
No debt was paid no dowry to be gained
No treaty over border land or power
No semblance of the world outside remained
To stain the beauty of this nuptial hour

[Chorus]
The secret marriage vow is never spoken
The secret marriage never can be broken

[Verse 2]
No flowers on the alter
No white veil in your hair
No maiden dress to alter
No bible oath to swear
