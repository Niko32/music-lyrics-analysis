[Narrator]
The evening stars shine brightly over Heaven's Cove
As night descends in silence, the fated scene unfolds
Consumed with trepidation, Arhys hears his brother's voice:

[Gabriel's Voice]
"As you're facing the path that divides
I will always be here by your side."

[Arhys]
I feel my pulse begin to race
Beads of sweat drip down my face
I have made a grave mistake

What have I done?
My blood for my son?
It's not too late
I won't betray him

[Daryus]
I knew the day had come and you could be tempted
To give up the Chosen One and finally end this
Do anything for your son, a terminal weakness
Now you're as good as done
You might also like[Arhys]
I didn't have a choice and I was defenseless
I didn't believe his voice and fighting was senseless
But now I can see the truth, I've come to my senses
I shouldn't have trusted you

[Narrator]
Arhys was never aware
His son had followed him there
Confused and deathly afraid
X watched his hero be brave

[Arhys]
On the path that divides, you were there by my side
There will be no betrayal tonight
I found courage and strength, in the words you once sang
Tore the truth from the lies, on the path that divides

[Instrumental Break. Daryus and Arhys clash swords. Daryus quickly overpowers Arhys with all his might.]

[Daryus]
You dare defy your prince?
Well you just threw your life away
Along with Xander's dreams
You chose the wrong man to betray!
[Narrator]
Two hungry warriors clash in the shadows of the night
But that's the cost with every fight
And Arhys' fight for hope cost him his very life
