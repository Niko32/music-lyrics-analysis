From a tender age, I was cursed with rage
Came swingin' like a fist inside a battin' cage
I went swimmin' with the Devil at the bottom of a lake
And he left me there by my lonesome
He was tall and mean with venom eyes so green
Wanted reconciliation, but my tongue was in my teeth
I couldn't find the floor, so I was kickin' with my feet
But they weren't there, they were stolen

[Chorus]
There is a lighthouse
In thе middle of the deep
And I'm still stranded on thе shoreline there
And nobody hears me scream
And I'll lure you like a landslide
And I'll show you lovely things
If you rescue me, but they're make-believe
The lighthouse by the sea

[Verse 2]
I met a sailor on a ship with promise in his eyes
He kissed me on the mouth and dug his fingers in my thighs
But a sailor ain't a savior 'cause they only tell you lies
So I left him there 'til the sunrise
Well, the waves were tall and they were crashin' down
He's layin' in the water, begging God to let him drown
So I showed him all my teeth and then I laughed out loud
'Cause I never wanted savin', I just wanted to be found
You might also like[Chorus]
There is a lighthouse
In the middle of the deep
And I'm still stranded on the shoreline there
And nobody hears me scream
And I'll lure you like a landslide
And I'll show you lovely things
If you rescue me, but they're make-believe
The lighthouse by the sea

[Bridge]
Well, that should teach a man to mess with me
He was never seen again and I'm still wanderin' the beach
And I'm glad I met the Devil 'cause he showed me I was weak
And a little piece of him is in a little piece of me

[Chorus]
There is a lighthouse
In the middle of the deep
And I'm still stranded on the shoreline there
And nobody hears me scream
And I'll lure you like a landslide
And I'll show you lovely things
If you rescue me, but they're make-believe
The lighthouse by the sea
[Outro]
And the waves come crashing down
And the waves come crashing down
And the waves come crashing down (And the waves come crashing down)
And the waves come crashing down (And the waves come crashing down)
And the waves come crashing down (And the waves come crashing down)
And the waves come crashing down (And the waves come crashing down)
And the waves come crashing down (And the waves come crashing down)
And the waves come crashing down
