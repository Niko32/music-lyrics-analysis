I wear my scary mask when I'm afraid I don't belong
You can't read my brain until it's off
Not coming off, not coming off
Get up

[Chorus: Poppy]
I'm never gonna take it off, so don't touch me
Never gonna take it off, stop looking at me
Never gonna take it off, so don't touch me
Never gonna take it off, stop looking at me

[Post-Chorus: Jason Aalon Butler]
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright
You ain't gonna see me tonight

[Break: Poppy, Jason Aalon Butler, & Both]
M-A-S-K, am I okay?
M-A-S-K, am I okay?
M-A-S-K, am I okay?
M-A-S-K, am I okay?
Pop, pop, pop, pop (Are you wearing your mask?)
Pop, pop, pop (Are you wearing your mask?)
I wasn't me but I ain't scared now
I wasn't me and I don't care now
I wasn't me, I ain't scared now
I wasn't me, I don't care now

[Post-Chorus: Jason Aalon Butler]
I'm alright, I'm alright, I'm alright

[Outro: Poppy & Jason Aalon Butler]
I said don't look at me
Well, you heard the woman, so fucking look away
I'm never gonna take it off, so don't touch me
Never gonna take it off, stop looking at me
