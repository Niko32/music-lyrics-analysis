I'll sow my seeds with a metric grosse
No footsteps go beyond it
I'll eat the dirt where the rooster crows
Flesh rodeos, yeehaw, it's
Check your pulse in your teardrops
Make you a cyclops
Breakin' the branches off your family tree
Keep you up like a fluffer girl
Ain't that enough, sir?
Look in the sewer for my pedigree
Your truly cause repeats its pulse
And makes your tears, if you need it to
Make me blow out my brain or I'll point it at you
While I'm thinking of you
But I'm hangin' tough!

[Chorus]
Day, by, day, by, day, by, day, by
Day, by, day, by, day, by, day, by

[Bridge]
Listen closer to your mother
You can hear an ocean roar
Sittin' quiet in the corner
Put another record on
God hates a coward, sonny
Got a date with your VCR
Watch another action movie
Dream of me
You might also like[Verse 2]
On the only piano
Wrote the fuckin' concerto
Shoot pool with your eyeballs
Rack 'em up
Make a meal of your asshole
Gnaw on your fat soul
Dipping your heart in my vinegar
Like a million disappeared
Just how long did you think they would live
Prepare yourself
Come on defend
And everyone defend
And if you ever want to be
And give me something to kill
I'll never finish my plate
Or I'll burn it up

[Chorus]
Day, by, day, by, day, by, day, by
Day, by, day, by, day, by, day, by
