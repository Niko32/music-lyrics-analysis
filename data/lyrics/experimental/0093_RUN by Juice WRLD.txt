Father forgive me, for you know, that I'm always sinning
And I (And I), and I (And I), mhm (Mhm), mhm, mhm
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Excuse my language, that's a hang-up on how shitty I'm feeling
And I (And I), told (Told), uh
I'm sorry, I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute
And I, and I survived the night
Father forgive me, for you know, that I'm always sinning
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Oh, why'd you lie? You lied, you lied, you lied, you lied
Excuse my language, that's a hang-up on how shitty I'm been feeling
(Realize) Realize, that this life (This life, this life, this life)
I'm sorry, I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute

Nobody knows
