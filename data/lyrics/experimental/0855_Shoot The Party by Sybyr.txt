Yuh, fuck off with that mess, I'm tired of hidin' (Yuh)

Yuh, fuck outta my ear, I'ma shoot the party (Woah)
Yeah, hella fuckin' anger, come and try to stop me
(Fuck outta my head) I'ma shoot the party
Yuh, hella fuckin' anger, come and try to stop me
Yuh, fuck out my ear, I'ma shoot the party
Yuh, hella fuckin' anger, come and try to stop—
