Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
All damn night, been awake, aw yeah (No, yeah)
Run away, baby ain't my love (True, uh)
Hoping I wouldn't wait on ya (It's true)
Anything you say is on you (They know, uh)
Hoping I run away from love (True, uh)
Hoping I, I ride, aw yeah (I do)
Run away baby, can't find 'em (I know)
Hoping I don't want— wait what? (Oh)

[Refrain]
I hold my head up high and I wave real low
I lift my hands, no lie, and run away, I know
And when I wave goodbye, they all wave hello
And when I wave goodbye, they all wave hello

[Verse]
I do my thing, met your man, Mr. Barrio
I do my thing, met your man, Mr. Barrio
I do my thing, met your man, then I bleed real slow
I do my thing, watch me man, watch me better than you (Oh)
