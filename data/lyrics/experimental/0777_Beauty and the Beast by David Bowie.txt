Weaving down a byroad
Singing the song
That's my kind of highroad
Gone wrong

[Chorus]
My-my, smile at least
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

[Verse 2]
Something in the night
Something in the day
Nothing is wrong but darling
Something's in the way
There's slaughter in the air
Protest on the wind
Someone else inside me
Someone could get skinned, how?

[Chorus]
My-my, someone fetch a priest
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast, darling

[Instrumental]
You might also like[Chorus]
My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast
My-my
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast

[Bridge]
I wanted to believe me
I wanted to be good
I wanted no distractions
Like every good boy should, my-my

[Verse 3]
Nothing will corrupt us
Nothing will compete
Thank God heaven left us
Standing on our feet

[Chorus]
My-my, Beauty and the Beast, my-my
Just Beauty and the Beast
You can't say no to the Beauty and the Beast, darling
My-my, my-my
