'Cause we lost everything
We had to pay the price

[Verse 1]
I saw in you what life was missing
You lit a flame that consumed my hate
I'm not one for reminiscing but
I'd trade it all for your sweet embrace

[Post-Verse]
'Cause we lost everything
We had to pay the price

[Verse 2]
There's a canvas with two faces
Of fallen angels who loved and lost
It was a passion for the ages
But in the end guess we paid the cost

[Bridge]
A thing of beauty - I know
Will never fade away
What you did to me - I know
Said what you had to say
But a thing of beauty
You might also like[Chorus]
Will nеver fade away
Will nevеr fade away

[Verse 3]
I see your eyes, I know you see me
You're like a ghost, you're everywhere
I'm your demon, never leaving
A metal soul of rage and fear

[Post-Verse]
That one thing that changed it all
That one sin that caused the fall

[Bridge]
A thing of beauty - I know
Will never fade away
What you did to me - I know
Said what you had to say
But a thing of beauty - I know
Will never fade away
And I'll do my duty - I know
Somehow I'll find a way
But a thing of beauty
Will never fade away
And I'll do my duty
[Chorus]
We'll never fade away
We'll never fade away
We'll never fade away
We'll never fade away
