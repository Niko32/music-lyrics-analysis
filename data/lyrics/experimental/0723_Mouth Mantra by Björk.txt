My throat was stuffed
My mouth was sewn up
Banned from making noise
I was not heard

[Verse 2]
Remove this hindrance
My throat feels stuck
I was not allowed
I was not heard
I was not heard
I was not heard
I was not heard

[Verse 3]
There is vocal sadness
I was separated
From what I can do
What I'm capable of

[Verse 4]
Need to break up
Vicious habits
Do something I haven't done
I haven't done before
You might also like[Bridge]
In vow of silence
I explore the negative space
Around my mouth
It implodes
Black hole
With jaw fallen in
In fallen jaw
Jaw fallen in
I am not hurt
I am not hurt

[Verse 5]
This tunnel has enabled
Thousands of sounds
I thank this trunk
Noise pipe, noise pipe

[Verse 6]
I have followed a path
That took sacrifices
Now I sacrifice this scar
Can you cut it off?

[Outro]
