(I can't think of nothing)
(I'd like to do a nursery rhyme)

[Verse 1]
You crazy babe Bathsheba, I want ya
You're suffocatin', you need a good shed
I'm tired of living, Shebe, so gimme

[Chorus]
Dead!
Dead!

[Verse 2]
We're apin', rapin', tapin', catharsis
You get torn down and I get erected
My blood is workin' but my, my heart is

[Chorus]
Dead!
Dead!
Dead!

[Bridge]
Hey, what do you know?
Your lovely tan belly is starting to grow
You might also like[Verse 3]
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper
Uriah hit the crapper, the crapper

[Chorus]
Dead!
Dead!

[Outro]
Dead! Dead!
Dead!
