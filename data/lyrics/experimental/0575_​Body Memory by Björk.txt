First snow of Winter
I'm walking hills and valleys
Adore this mystical fog!
This fucking mist!
These cliffs are just showing off!

[Refrain 1]
Then the body memory kicks in
I mime my home mountains
The moss that I'm made of
I redeem myself

[Verse 2]
I've been wrestling my fate
Do I accept this ending?
Will I accept my death
Or struggle claustrophobic?
Fought like a wolverine
With my destiny
Refuse to accept what was meant to be

[Refrain 2]
Then the body memory kicks in
And I trust the unknown
Unfathomable imagination
Surrender to future
You might also like[Verse 3]
Oh, how to capture all this love
And find a pathway for it
Like threading an ocean through a needle
River through a keyhole
Can't fathom the grasp
I can't grasp the fathom

[Refrain 3]
Then my body memory kicks in
My limbs and tongue take over
Like the ancestors before me
Show me the flow

[Verse 4]
My sexual DNA
X-rays of my Kama Sutras
Summons different bodies
Compares spines and buttocks
And back of necks

[Refrain 4]
Then my body memory kicks in
It simply takes over
Bestiality
I redeem my body
[Verse 5]
I wasn't born urban
Toxic doesn't agree with me
Love lured me here
Into a stagnant state
My myths, my customs, ridiculed
Vacuum packed molecules

[Refrain 5]
Then my body memory kicks in
On this Brooklyn dance floor
Sweating with these rhythms
Rotate this matrix

[Verse 6]
All trapped in legal harness
Kafkaesque
Farce like patriarchy
Avoided to confront it

[Refrain 6]
Then the body memory kicks in
My warrior awakens
My turn to defend
Urban didn't tame me
[Refrain 7]
Then my body memory kicks in
All bosoms and embraces
Oral, anal entrances
Enjoy the satisfaction
If the other is growing
