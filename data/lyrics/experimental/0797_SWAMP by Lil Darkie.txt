Mayday, sewer flooding
Evacuate immediately
Mayday, sewer flooding
Evacuate immediately
(Get the fuck outta here!)
Boss, the gaskets blown
We're holding it back as long as we can

[Verse 1]
Every day
I wake up, my mind filled with stuff I can't say
Blackened muck and it backin' up in my brain
Stack and puff, like ain't that enough for my pain?
Actin' tough will not get the fuckin' swamp drained

[Bridge]
The swamp never drained (Drain)
The swamp never drained
The swamp never drained
â€‹srettam yllaer gnihton taht dna yraropmet si gnihtyreve taht detpecca evah tub ,ytilaer siht ni ecalp ym detpecca evah I .htaed detpecca evah I
Hahahahaha
Hello, monkeys
Hahahahaha
Swamp (Hahaha), swamp
Yo' (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

Take me back to the back of the class, bitch, stand for the flag, salute
Take me back to the mass when my grandfather passed in the past and I'm on them pews
Afraid of the dark, I just left my brain at the park, aw shoot (Huh)
Fuck all the hate and the city and the state, you're doin' what they want you to
F-f-fuck the system, fuck division
Always hearing, never listen
Disappearin' from your vision
Fuck your laziness and reckless indecision
You are just a maggot on a mission (Faggot, pissin')
I don't give a fuck about a pussy nigga, bitch
I gotta get it, gotta get it, my nigga, to generate
Another nigga growin' bigger, the figure inseminated
Hella faded when I puff on the stick
The tar stickin' made of bigger shit that sit in the pit
I gotta spit it, gotta get it out, floodin' my skin
This shit build up, breakin' down the barrier quick

[Interlude]
I have allowed this shit to build up for too long
I have said nothing for too long
Yuh
Yuh, yuh, yuh
Yuh (Alright, listen up you stupid sons of bitches)
Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
[Verse 3]
I'm tired of feelin' so depressed
Breathin' all this smoke into my chest
Everywhere I go, I make a mess
I don't wanna end up like the rest
Anything can end up on the test
Always been a mission to take those
The same niggas wishing you the best
Never wanna see a nigga blow
Never wanna pull up to a show
Do not hit my motherfuckin' phone
I got psilocybin in my dome
I know what you're hiding, what you on
Mouth breathing, clout seizing, couch sleeping
Piece of fucking garbage, nigga
Stop breeding, stop fucking, stop sucking
Stop all that for starters, nigga
Niggas doin' punk shit for likes
You ain't nothin' like the punk shit you like
Cut yourself and put your hair in spikes
Niggas playin' dress up, like some dykes
Oh, does that offend a bit? Right
Do not get it motherfuckin' twisted
I don't give a fuck if you tight
And I'ma do my business from a distance
Rappers talkin' shit about the right
But they the ones that's givin' to the system
Benefittin' from it when we fight
The government will never fuckin' listen
I ain't gonna stand here and cap
I ain't gonna stand here and lie
Yo' favorite rapper lying when he rap
Yo' favorite rapper liable to die
Yo' favorite rapper take it in the back
Feeding, givin' money for attention
Designer drip, blowin' hella racks
Ain't nobody focused on ascension
Everyone a hypocrite, facts
I am just a maggot on a mission
I ain't cuttin' anybody slack
The rapper is the new politician (Yeah, huh)
The rapper is the new democrat
Republican, better remember that
We always talk about 'bout where we are never at (Huh)
The rapper is the new Bill Clinton
Lookin' for an evil bitch, Hillary
Baby blood inside a goblet filling me
Military coppin' mad artillery
Drain the swamp (Huh)
Oh really, nigga? But I thought I did
These other sucker niggas pray to God I got a problem
Thought I'd solve it with a thought I'm in
I woke up today (Goo-Good morning), I just wanna go back to sleep
Liked it better when I couldn't even tell you motherfuckers had a back to me
[Outro]
What's the matter, you scared? (Huh)
I can't see anything
Are you over here?
Hello?
Hello?
