Ooh, ooh
Hey, hey

[Verse 1]
So what's the price?
We're like mosquitoes to light, in a sense
I feed off bioluminescence
Love and intent
So it's a quick fix
What else does life have to give but the pain
Generated inside our own brains?
It's a sick game, yeah

[Chorus: Arianna Reid & Daniel Caesar]
Submit to me, come get down on one knee
I'm your saviour and I'll give you everything that you need
(That you need)
Submit to me, come get down on one knee
I'm your saviour and I'll give you everything that you need

[Verse 2]
Blaspheming the spirit
I just don't want to hear it, too deep
What I've sown I'll continue to reap
I'll earn my keep
It was all good intentions
Did I forget to mention? My God
Just tryna get money with my dogs
Is that so wrong?

Submit to me, come get down on one knee
I'm your saviour and I'll give you everything that you need
(That you need)
Submit to me, come get down on one knee
I'm your saviour and I'll give you everything that you need

[Verse 3]
Lately you've been on a wave
Seen you lit up in the place
Sometimes you're sad, I see it on your face
I can tell you're not okay
I know you're only seeking out the beauty
In fulfilling your duty
The answers it seems
Are inside your own dreams

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Good God, Jehovah, what's this I see?
My mortality's staring back at me
Niggas think I'm scared
Niggas think I'm a bitch
Like I ain't come prepared and I ain't know what this is
I've slept like Jacob, a rock for a pillow
Run swift like Elijah, away from the middle
Seen the world, overindulged maybe a little
But now your boy is up, and I'm fit as a fiddle
Oh Lord, Jehovah, what's this I see?
Bourgeoisie tryna silence me
They don't know what I've been through
Don't know what I pree'd
Seen shit that you see up in your TV screen
Follow me to salvation
Your mind still 'pon plantations
The shepherd, holds information
Gives it out as its taken
Yeah, yeah
