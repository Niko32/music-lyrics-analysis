Our love was my womb
But our bond has broken
My shield is gone
My protection is taken
I am one wound
My pulsating body
Suffering being

[Verse 2]
My heart is enormous lake
Black with potion
I am blind
Drowning in this ocean

[Verse 3]
My soul torn apart
My spirit is broken
Into the fabric of all
He is woven

[Verse 4]
You fear my limitless emotions
I am bored of your apocalyptic obsessions
Did I love you too much?
Devotion bent me broken
So I rebelled
Destroyed the icon
You might also like[Verse 5]
I did it for love
I honoured my feelings
You betrayed your own heart
Corrupted that organ

[Verse 6]
Family was always
Our sacred mutual mission
Which you abandoned

[Verse 7]
You have nothing to give
Your heart is hollow
I'm drowned in sorrows
No hope in sight of ever recover
Eternal pain and horrors

[Verse 8]
I am a glowing shiny rocket
Returning home
As I enter the atmosphere
I burn off layer by layer
