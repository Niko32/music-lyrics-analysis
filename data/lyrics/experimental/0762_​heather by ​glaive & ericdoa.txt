Woah, woah, oh
Woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1: glaive]
I don't like how you talk to me so constantly
And you probably thinking "Wait, wait, what could he offer me?"
I need all these strangers to get off of me
They watching me like, "Where will he go?" like, "What will he do?"
I heard this rumor 'bout him, but I don't know if it's true
'Cause I've never been better, I gave that bitch Astrid my sweater
But I bought another and gave it to Heather

[Chorus: ericdoa]
I got it on me, lil' baby, I make 'em lay down
Grown men askin' me questions like what I make now
I want everything inside his pockets like it's a shakedown
And if he swing, man, we get to jumpin' like it's a playground
Ayy, I don't know what you want from me
Bringing up times when you wanted me
Anything you want, I got all those things
Ha, yeah, I got all those things

[Verse 2: ericdoa]
I got a hard head, but it's not nothing new
You hit me up last night, look' for some' to do
I think it's fucked up that you're making me choose
Ayy, I've had enough, it's quite rough being stuck to you
Shut your mouth, ayy, I'm tryna get up, but I don't know how
From dawn 'til dusk, we'll be at your house
Get this shit turned up, jump inside the crowd

I'm M.I.A., no one ever seems to know where I be at
They on my ass, I don't do much, I smile at her and I just laugh
They always mad, so I just brush it off and act like I can't help it
After everything that happened, how come I cannot be selfish? I swear

[Chorus: ericdoa]
I got it on me, lil' baby, I make 'em lay down
Grown men askin' me questions like what I make now
I want everything inside his pockets like it's a shakedown
And if he swing, man, we get to jumpin' like it's a playground
Ayy, I don't know what you want from me
Bringing up times when you wanted me
Anything you want, I got all those things
Ha, yeah, I got all those things
