I think, maybe
Hold on, I'll try to give it another go
(Bo-Bo-Box cutters)

[Chorus: Karm the Tool]
My my, I think we have a spy
I'll swing my fist, you turn your face, I hit the other side
I-I'll-I'll die, so, why can't I decide?
My brain might self-destruct, I'll lose myself to suicide-suicide
My my, I think we have a spy
I'll swing my fist, you turn your face, I hit the other side
I'll-I'll die, so, why can't I decide?
My brain might self-destruct, I'll lose myself to suicide-suicide

[Verse 1: Karm the Tool & Yung Skayda]
Wockhardt on my dresser and I'm saving it for later (Yuh, yuh, yuh)
Look at your bills, my bills elevator
I woke up feeling fruity, guess I'm feeling like a hatеr
Where I come from, you can't flip, you ain't a skatеr
And this is just a neighborly conversation with neighbors (Shh)
They do not have a gun to me pointed under the table (Sh, sh, hush away)
And if you were to kick up and make another distraction (Ayy, ayy)
I could hit the door and be out if I am enabled (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
I won't be what you want to be, I-I-I-I–, E-E-E-E–
Kill my pets, label me a freak, I-I-I-I–, E-E-E-E-E-E–
I've lost bets but that's on me, I-I-I-I–, eh-eh-eh-eh-eh-ah–
Kill my friends, fuck the police, eh-eh-eh-eh-eh–

My brain might self-destruct, I'll lose myself to suicide-suicide (Yeah, yuh-yuh-yuh)

[Verse 2: Yung Skayda]
I lean on my dresser, huh
Thinking everyday, huh
"How could I be extra, huh?"
I'ma find a way, uh
You can despite me all you want but I'll be paid, uh
You can drink my piss from a glass, lemonade, yeah
Me like this type of instrumental, yeah (Instrumental)
Avatar moves, elemental (Elemental)
Weed mad loud like a kettle (Like a kettle)
Crank that bass, no treble, yeah (No treble)
You can hit me on my seven digits (On my digits)
Text me, baby, yeah, I meant it (Oh, goddamn)
Try not to get sentimental (Stupid bitch)
Yeah, you like me, baby, yeah, I get it (You an idiot)
Lucky like a lottery, please don't try to talk to me (What? What? What?)
I'ma try to walk away if you try to talk to me (Shut the fuck up)
Baby wanna fuck in my truck that's parked in my farm
Take her 'round the barn, show lil' shawty that I'm hard (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
[Chorus: Karm the Tool]
My my, I think we have a spy

My brain might self-destruct, I'll lose myself to suicide-suicide
My my, I think we have a spy
I'll swing my fist, you turn your face, I hit the other side
I'll-I'll die, so, why can't I decide?
My brain might self-destruct, I'll lose myself to suicide-suicide
