I don't love you baby-baby
I don't
Bladeecity  (Love you baby-baby)
One thousand diamonds

[Verse 1: Bladee]
I stay out of sight, it's a satellite life
Got a shadow ice knife, Gucci lenses on my eyes
Bank account match my clothing size
That explains the price of my shoes
I got news, you can get cut up like fruit
Bladee one sound like Akon when I make songs
Say some' wrong, you may run, you get rained on
Someone rather than no one, I got no one (One)
I was so wrong, waited so long (Waited so long)
You were no one, hold on (Hold on)
I should go home to the chrome zone (Go home; ahh)
No ozone, sold my soul, now my soul's gone (Ahh)
I hold the map, I got the keys to the city (Ahh, ahh)
GTB, I see machines in the city
Helicopters when we leave in December (Oh, oh, oh)
On my LG, call my team, we assemble ('ssemble)
I'm beyond, I don't believe in the system (System)
You can sing, I press delete, I don't listen (Listen)
I got items, I'm complete for no reason (Reason)
Got no meaning, pull the card, get a reading

Thaiboy Goon, I got that weed in my system
You can sing, I press delete, I don't listen
I got cash, I pull up clean for no reason
On my iPhone, call my team, now I'm beamin'
Thaiboy Goon, I make the scene when I'm dreamin'
GTBSB, we riding with no ceilin'
Yung Thaiboy Goon, I'm posted in the buildin'
You can sing, I press delete, I don't listen

[Outro]
I don't love you baby-baby
I don't love you baby-baby
I don't love you baby-baby
I don't love you baby-baby
