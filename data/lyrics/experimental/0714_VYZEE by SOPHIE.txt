Shake, shake, shake it up and make it fizz
If that's what you wanna do
If that's what you wanna do

[Verse 1]
If you want to make them scream
Look at me, it's simple
We'll make it easily
If you need that something, but don't know what it is
Shake, shake, shake it up and make it fizz
You've got to twist your body
Twirl it all around
Make it pop and sizzle
Now squish it on the ground
If you need that something, but don't know what it is
Shake, shake, shake, it up and make it fizz

[Chorus]
We can go crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
If that's what you wanna do
We can go crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
If that's what you wanna do
If that's what you wanna do
If that's what you wanna do
You might also like[Verse 2]
If you squish it in your hand
Make it pop, red and white
Tomato soup can
If you need that something
And that's really what you want
Shake, shake, shake it up and make it fizz
You've got to stir that mixture
Make it really thick
Let it drip all over
Now give the spoon a lick
If you need that something and that's really what you want
Shake, shake, shake it up and make it fizz

[Chorus]
We can go crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
If that's what you wanna do
We can go crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
If that's what you wanna do

[Bridge]
Hey, we can jump up
We can get down low
Mix it all up
We can go loco
Whatever you want
There's nothing we can't do
'Cause we can go up
And that's what we gon' do
We can jump up, up, up
Make them say "Mmm yeah, wow, that's nice"
Smash it all up
Let it drip-drop low
Whatever you need
Just tell me and we'll go
'Cause we can stay here or we can go
We can go
We can go
[Outro]
(Crazy and then pop)

(If that's what you wanna do)
(We can go crazy and then pop)
(Crazy and then pop)
Shake, shake, shake it up and make it fizz
If that's what you want to do, do, do
If that's what you want to do
If that's what you want to do
Crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
If that's what you want to do
We can go crazy and then pop
C-c-c-crazy and then pop
Crazy and then pop
If that's what you want to do
Shake, shake, shake it up and make it fizz
