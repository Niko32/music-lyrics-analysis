Take 'em up, take 'em out
Bring 'em out dead

[Verse 1: Evil Nigga & Onyx]
I gots one question
Where did you get lessons?
I'm just so stressed
And I want your blessings (Bring 'em out dead)
Don't get me wrong, I was fibbin'
Hah, you just a toilet I piss in, hah
LMAO, LOL, sheesh
Bitch, I'm just fuckin' around (Bring 'em out dead)
Piss, piss, piss on the kitchen floor
Blood on my dick and my head feeling broke
This isn't what you deserve
But all I wanna do is handle my urges (Bring 'em out dead)
Evil Nigga gotta burn all the rest
Fuck what you thought about passing a test
Drowning every single soul I don't like
Under heavy pressure water without a fight (Bring 'em out dead)
