It ain't a secret, if I give you my heart, then you can keep it
See, your love is a drug and I been fiendin'
I'm a addict, I'm a addict, girl, I need it (Oh)
Girl, keep it, if I give you my heart, you better keep it (Keep it)
Keep it, girl, keep it, if I give you my heart, you better keep it (Exhale)

[Post-Chorus]
Butterflies when you're on my mind, I can't breathe well
Any night you ain't by my side, I can't sleep well
'Bout time I won at this game of love, took a few L's
If you ain't here, we on FaceTime, runnin' up my phone bill

[Verse]
You helpin' me with confidence, I know that I'm the shit still
My anxiety has me wired, but girl, you help me sit still
You my only pharmacy, you always keep my script filled
Runnin' through these highs with me, you know how this shit feel
Always keep my guys with me, niggas that'll die for me
But I know you ride for me, you would homicide for me
Shootin' at any bitch, if you ever have a rivalry
Empty out the clip, wait, then pull off with my bae
Let's go back to my place, then turn it to our place
Started in the doorway, kissing through the hallway
Trippin' over Gucci slippers, almost took a fall, ayy
I'm not like these goofy niggas, you can have my heart, ayy-ayy
You might also like[Bridge]
Once upon a time, in a land far, far away
There was a love so divine
The same love ended up in my face

[Chorus]
It ain't a secret, if I give you my heart, then you can keep it
See, your love is a drug and I been fiendin'
I'm a addict, I'm a addict, girl, I need it (Oh)
Girl, keep it, if I give you my heart, you better keep it (Keep it)
Keep it, girl, keep it, if I give you my heart, you better keep it (Exhale)

[Post-Chorus]
Butterflies when you're on my mind, I can't breathe well
Any night you ain't by my side, I can't sleep well
'Bout time I won at this game of love, took a few L's
If you ain't here, we on FaceTime, runnin' up my phone bill
