Imagine a future and be in it
Feel this incredible nurture, soak it in
Your past is on loop â€” turn it off
See this possible future and be in it

[Refrain 1]
Hold fort for love forever
We're just momentary vessels
We're just carrying

[Verse 2]
Trust your head around
Guide your stare elsewhere
Your love is already waiting
You're already in it

[Refrain 2]
Hold fort for love forever

[Interlude]
Watch me form new nests
Weave a matriarchal dome
Build a musical scaffolding
Between sleep and awake
Day and night
Between night and day

You say I mirror peoples' missions at them
Now you mirror at me who I used to be
What I gave to the world
You've giving back at me

[Refrain 2]
Hold fort for love forever
