White on white translucent black capes
Back on the rack
Bela Lugosi's dead
The bats have left the bell tower
The victims have been bled
Red velvet lines the black box

[Chorus]
Bela Lugosi's dead
Bela Lugosi's dead
Undead, undead, undead
Undead, undead, undead

[Verse 2]
The virginal brides file past his tomb
Strewn with time's dead flowers
Bereft in deathly bloom
Alone in a darkened room
The count

[Chorus]
Bela Lugosi's dead
Bela Lugosi's dead
Bela Lugosi's dead
Undead, undead, undead
Undead, undead, undead
Undead

Oh Bela

Bela's undead
Oh Bela
Bela's undead
Oh Bela

[Outro]
Undead
