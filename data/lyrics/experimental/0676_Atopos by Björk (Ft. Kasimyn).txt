Are these not just excuses to not connect?
Our differences are irrelevant
To only name the flaws
Are excuses to not connect

[Verse 1]
I bow to all that you've given me
Thank you for staying while we learn
To find our resonance where we do connect
To find our resonance where we do connect

[Verse 2]
If we don't grow outwards towards love
We'll implode inwards towards destruction
If my plant doesn't reach towards you
There's internal erosion towards all
Pursuing the light too hard is a form of hiding

[Chorus]
Are these not just excuses to not connect?
Our differences are irrelevant
To insist on absolute justice at all times
It blocks connection

[Outro]
Our union is stronger, our union is stronger than us
Hope is a muscle
That allows us to connect
Hope is a muscle
Hope is a muscle
Hope is a muscle
Hope is a muscle
That allows us to connectYou might also like
