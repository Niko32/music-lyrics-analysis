Hm
You know, if you're a writer, start writing
Haha
(If you’re not trying to go to a party, then write songs)
If you write songs, write songs
(If you're not trying to go to a party then start writing right now)

[Verse 1: Daniel Caesar]
See, I can write down what I see
I'm hanging by the thread of my misery
Been feeling like there’s nothing out there for me
Still waiting on a feeling got away from me

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & Jacob Collier]
I'm trying to restore the feeling
God damn wouldn't it be nice?
I know that my mind is willing
Can't seem to get this right
I'm trying to restore the feeling
God damn wouldn't it be nice?
I know that my mind is willing
I just gotta get my body right
Won't you sing it now?
Eh-eh-eh, eh, eh-eh-eh, eh

Right now I can't seem
To fight the feeling, demons here waiting on me
I’m hanging by my pride, my energy
Is draining slowly, please don’t cry, shorty
Ay, miss me with that "How you been, how you doing?"
In Paris talking fluent, like they know my influence
Took a lot of talent to make thousands out of toonies
But that's exactly what I’m doing
I got Danny Caesar cooing
I'm peeling back Backwoods, I guess I'm back to work
Make a mill' off a classic verse
Will I make a mill’ or a classic first?
(I'm feeling)

[Chorus: Daniel Caesar & Jacob Collier]
I'm trying to restore the feeling (Oh-oh)
God damn, wouldn't it be nice? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I know that my mind is willing (Oh-oh)
Can't seem to get this right (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I'm trying to restore the feeling (Oh-oh)
God damn, wouldn't it be nice? (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
I know that my mind is willing (Oh-oh)
I just gotta get my body right (Oh-oh-oh-oh)
Go restore that feeling
[Outro: Jacob Collier & Daniel Caesar]
Restore, feel
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Mind is willing
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Go restore that feeling
Feeling, feel, I can't feel it
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Go restore that feeling
