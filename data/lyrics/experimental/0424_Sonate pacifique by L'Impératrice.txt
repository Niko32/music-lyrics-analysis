I'm feeling my heart
Beating with the rhythm of her body slowly moves
I love this feeling
Mm-mmm
Yeah, yeah

Well I can't deny it, mm
She turns me on and I can't control this burning desire
I wish we could
Having fun under the sun

I don't know what it is but there is a trick in her
Who works on me
So well
And I can't deny it, mm
She turns me on like a firecracker in the summer sun

I can feel my mind
Slowly fading with the smell of her perfume
And when she's dancing
Oh damn
Mm-mmm

She turns me on
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene
With a gangsta lean, wooh-ooh
She turns me on
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene
With a gangsta lean, wooh-ooh
She turns me on
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene
With a gangsta lean, wooh-ooh
She turns me on
Diamond in the back, sunroof top
Diggin' the scene
With a gangsta lean, wooh-ooh

She turns me on
