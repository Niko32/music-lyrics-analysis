House party in a Hyde Park road with the Function One's yelling "guys come over
Front yards in a state, some girls doin’ NOS well away from the heat and the odours
"Name, please"
"Yeah, I'm on plus-one, sir and my mates are too" so we swerve past the bouncer
Crew splits, some go house, grime heads downstairs and I move to the girl on the counter like
"Hello, ma Cherie, I be off my nut
Got a few beers bubbling about my gut
Like your eyes, hair, thighs, mouth and rounded bumper
Lausse The Cat, you can take my number
Take my hand do a twirl "gottdamn"
And I swear I ain't never seen as pretty of a girl
Eyes glimmering be looking like pearls
Bit cheesy I know but my sleazy approach won’t work yet...

[Verse 1: Lausse the Cat]
...but you can be my mistress
I'll be your furry assistant
Purpose be serving your thirst ridden wishlist
Cursed to increase all your thoughts hedonistic
A purrve in the sheets see my chirpse your hibiscus
Your ass be my biscuit
'bit egotistic
But gives in the sheets like a service at Christmas
First month free til' I swerve in the distance
And don't ask why it's my terms and conditions"

Instead smiles and says "I admire your wishful thinking what's your name"
I said Lausse The Kitten
And we talked in the kitchen a fable of nonsense
Rushed up the stairs
Hopscotching the long steps
Pranced round the top floor in search of a locked bed
Nix on the keys; tell the boys what went on next

[Pre-verse 2: Lausse the Cat]
And they sexed all month
So I guess you could call it puppy love
And of course kitten kicked in the end
Before the lust turned dry
And as tough as the girl seemed
Cursed she fell with thoughts unsolved
Called the cat but he already had a new girl by his side

[Verse 2: Lausse the Cat]
Sorry my darling
Should have been clearer
L never stays long
He just disappears to
Bodybag hearts for a scarf in the winter
When the spark goes I don't linger
Commenced by lust yet
Trust will desist it
Hey honey I think it’s best I insist I get
The fuck out of this picture
Don’t cry, don't give a shit
Let a new romance be an elixir
Would you prefer if I left you the morning after
No calls, no talks or laughter
Just sauce and flesh
And shamed walks through parks
And no constant sex from said sex toy
[Pre-verse 3: Lausse the Cat]
Don’t get vexed
Heard love songs sung by a fuccboi
Shouldn't be alarmed if I duck
Oi, don't start slating my name cos' I’m not entertained no more
I made it clear it's a fling
Cos' I don't really wanna
Come to the point where I spunk on your thigh
After 10 minutes straight
Cos' I'm comfy inside
And I bust on your thigh
Cos' we only do it sideways now
Now we're done exploring
We know what excites us
You know what my minds like
I know when you're done soon
Rushed through sex now before bed and never noon
Thrice in the week the excitement done left us now
So I'll say "yo babe imma cut soon"
"Spoon me"
"Fuck that"
"Don't be a cunt Cat"
"Sorry, imma go bun some hash where my don's at?"
"Right here"
"Yes lad"
"Let's get seshed out"
"Give me a sec with this girl then I'll get back"
Walked to the girl sitting down on her side
Saw him approach, thought he switched up his mind
Flipped her around got the girl upside down
With her neck to the floor (stop) as he distanced her thighs (what are you doing?)
Fisted her ass as he ran past the cervix
Reached to her heart ripped it out with a firm grip
Gulped it in one then the cat disappeared
Left Lucy with one bad heart and her tears
