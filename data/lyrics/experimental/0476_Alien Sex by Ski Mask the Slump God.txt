[Intro]
Yuh, yuh

[Verse]
She need a father figure, I need a shot of liquor
So come here, baby, arch your back, 'cause I'm a posture fixer
Pass my crumpets and elixir, Harry Potter wizard
Touchin' money, different colors like I'm playin' Twister
Huh, brand-new Prada getter
I can't fuck with shawty unless I can make a dollar with her
All my bitches act like tools, but they Scissor Sisters
Shittin' on them, I'm like, "Cool, they just kitty litter"
Huh, yeah, hasta la vista
I'm tryna put somethin' in your egg like it's Easter
Breaking Bad, when I whip my wrist, I break a beaker
In my head, just tryna control me like a dealer
Huh, on the hunt for a hun like Attila
Keep a shell on me like a armadillo
What's that smell on me? That Chanel on me
I'm a fire breathin' dragon, light the spell on me

[Verse]
Tryna get to the bottom of me, I am an anomaly
Made you think of Insidious, got a monster inside of me
I'm talkin' an entity, ask me what that meant to me
I say the lottery (Okay), 'cause nobody bother me (Okay)
I am a philosopher (Uh-huh), something like the Socrates (What else?)
And when I shoot the pistol (Mm-hm), I'm Megan with the knees (Yuh)
They number two like pencil, couldn't really fuck around with me (Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh)
I'm something like your dental 'cause my wisdom knocked-out teeth, bitch (Yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh)
Okay (Uh-huh), okay (Ayy)
Say you gettin' chips, baby, Frito-Lay (Free, ayy)
Been gettin' bread since before the back page
Been gettin' bread like a jar of mayonnaise
Okay (Okay), okay (Ayy)
You got bad energy, I might burn some sage
The human centipede, shittin' on 'em all day
Sneakin' and geekin', I tweak out, Nick Cage (Water!)
Fish fillet, caviar, duck confit
Don't be alarmed, this is a regular Monday (Hee)
No candy bar, yes, I'm thinkin' 'bout a payday
You are my food, look at my plate, I'm 'bout to say grace (Ayy)
This that make ya stank face like the mace spray (Mace spray)
Uhm, this my flow, I hit it first like I'm Ray J (Ray J)
Uhm, jump, mayday, uhm, jump, mayday
Like it's Friday, and I'm Day-Day on a vacay' (Ayy)

Alien sex (Yuh, yuh), I am not impressed (Water!)
Well, if you must confess, better say it with your chest, bitch
