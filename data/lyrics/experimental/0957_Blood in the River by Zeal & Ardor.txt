[Aleister Crowley Sample]
Lord visible and sensible
Of whom this earth is but a frozen spark
Turning about thee with annual and diurnal motion
Source of light, source of life
Let thy perpetual radiance hearten us
To continual labour and enjoyment;
So that as we are constant partakers of thy bounty
We may in our particular orbit give out light and life
Sustenance and joy
To them that revolve about us
A good lord is a dead one
The riverbed will run red
