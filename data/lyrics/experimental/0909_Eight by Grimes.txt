Try this, try this
Try this, try this
Try this, try this
Try this, try this

[Verse 1]
It's always something
It's always something
I know you're running and we know, hey
I feel my heartbeat
You tell me nothing
You tell me nothing in this town, no

[Chorus]
Go where you wanna go
When you get there, you'll be wishing you were back home
Oh, go where you wanna go
Because the sky is lifting and I can't stop drifting along

[Verse 2]
I'm singing with a lifeline
You want a lifeline
I'm singing for you softly
And when you got me
I am gone you know
You might also like[Chorus]
Go where you wanna go
When you get there, you'll be wishing you were back home
Oh, go where you wanna go
Because the sky is lifting and I can't stop drifting along

[Outro]
Try this, try this
Try this, try this
Try this, try this
Try this, try this
Try this, try this
Try this, try this
Try this, try this
Try this, try this
