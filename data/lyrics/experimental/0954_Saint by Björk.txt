She always knows when people need stroking
And is attracted to deathbeds and divorces
I dreamt she cared for my dying grandfather
Lying naked face down on his bed

[Verse 2]
She insists on total presence
And knows how to get through to the rest of us
She has entered me thousandfold often
And undone knots at my most awkward

[Refrain 1]
Music, music loves too

[Verse 3]
She reaches out to orphans and refugees
Embraces them with thermal blankets
Her favourite childhood moments
Were at a hospital for the disabled

[Verse 4]
I've seen her offer empathy to widows
She attends funerals of strangers
Her strongest memory
Is feeding children with leprosy

Music heals too
I'm here to defend it
