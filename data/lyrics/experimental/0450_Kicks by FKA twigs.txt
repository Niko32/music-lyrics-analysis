When I am low
I feel for you
Time passes by
Feeling for you

I explore
Stroke my side
Yes, I do
Feel for you

[Pre-Chorus]
So I tell myself, it's cool
For me to wait for you
Just for you
I collect my thoughts and breathe
Because I take your lead
Take your lead

[Chorus]
Tell me, what do I do when you're not here?
What do I do when you're not here?
Tell me, what do I do when you're not here?
What do I do when you're not here?
I get my kicks like you
You might also like[Verse 2]
When I'm alone
I don't need you
I love my touch
Know just what to do

[Pre-Chorus]
So I tell myself, it's cool
To get my kicks like you
Just like you
I just touch myself and say
I'll make my own damn way
Own damn way

[Bridge]
Tell me, what do I do
When you're not here?
Tell me, what do I do?
Baby, it's clear

[Chorus]
Tell me, what do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
What do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
(When you're not here)
Tell me, what do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
What do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
I get my kicks like you (When you're not here)
Tell me, what do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
What do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
(When you're not here)
Tell me, what do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
What do I do when you're not here? (When you're not here)
I get my kicks like you (When you're not here)
[Outro]
What do I do...
When you're not here?
I get my kicks like, I get my kicks like
I get my kicks like you
Tell me...
What do I do?
Baby, it's clear
