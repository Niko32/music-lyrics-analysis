Eyes in the sky crying geysers
How dare I have private desires
Don't rain on my papier-mâché
Don't rain on it, don't rain on it
[Verse 1]
Possession of the pussy weapon
My sacral chakra heaven's threatened
It's just flesh, it's just flesh
I can be grotesque, move my body like chess

[Bridge]
So you're scared of me now, huh?
So you're scared of me now, huh?
Oh, you're scared of me?
Oh, you're scared of me?

[Chorus]
Eyes in the sky crying geysers
How darе I have private desirеs
Don't rain on my papier-mâché
Don't rain on it, don't rain on it

[Verse 2]
Say you want my body, let me give it to you
Is that what you want, blood and guts?
Pussy teeth to imprison you
Little pills, I don't wanna get high
I feel an ache where my mind was
I try to think, but it's no use
Tumbleweed, bloody knees
I would crawl through broken glass to get homeYou might also like
