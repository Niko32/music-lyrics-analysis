Don't call me by my name
All of this is temporary
Watch as I slip away for your sake
All of this is temporary

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, maybe I could hold you in the dark
You won't even notice me depart
Secondhand thread in a secondhand bed
With a second man's head
Leavin' through the door without a word
You won't even notice, little bird
Better off dead, so I reckon I'm headed to Hell instead

[Chorus]
So don't wait for me, don't wait for me, wait-ah
It's not a happy ending
Don't wait for me, don't wait for me, wait-ah
It's not a happy ending

[Verse 2]
Jesus needed a three-day weekend
To sort out all his bullshit, figurе out the treason
I've been sеarching for a fortified defense
Four to five reasons
But Jesus, you've got better lips than Judas
I could keep your bed warm, otherwise, I'm useless
I don't really mean it 'cause who the fuck would choose this?

Well, maybe I could hold you in the dark
You won't even notice me depart
Secondhand thread in a secondhand bed
With a second man's head
Leavin' through the door without a word
You won't even notice, little bird
Better off dead, so I reckon I'm headed to Hell instead

[Chorus]
So don't wait for me, don't wait for me, wait-ah
It's not a happy ending
Don't wait for me, don't wait for me, wait-ah
It's not a happy ending
Don't wait for me, don't wait for me, wait-ah
It's not a happy ending
Don't wait for me, don't wait for me, wait-ah

[Bridge]
All of this is temporary
All of this is temporary
All of this is temporary
All of this is temporary

[Outro]
Dark, you won't even notice me depart
Secondhand thread in a second man's bed
With a second man's head
All of this is temporary
All of this is temporary
All of this is—
