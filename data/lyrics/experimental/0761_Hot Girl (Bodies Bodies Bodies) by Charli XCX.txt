Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
I'm a hot girl, pop girl, rich girl
I'm a bitch girl, fast girl, catch me if you can, girl
You a swerve, girl, who the fuck are you, girl?
You just wanna be me
I'm a hot girl, pop girl, rich girl
I'm a bitch girl, fast girl, catch me if you can, girl
You a swerve, girl, who the fuck are you, girl?
You just wanna be me

[Verse 1]
Pull up to the mansion, pull up to the party
All my friends are so hot, we gonna get it started
Pull up to the mansion, but you are not invited
Lip gloss on and I look good

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a hot girl, pop girl, rich girl
I'm a bitch girl, fast girl, catch me if you can, girl
You a swerve, girl, who the fuck are you, girl?
You just wanna be me
I'm a hot girl, pop girl, rich girl
I'm a bitch girl, fast girl, catch me if you can, girl
You a swerve, girl, who the fuck are you, girl?
You just wanna be me

Woo, woo, ha
Aha, aha, yeah, yeah
Aha, aha, yeah, yeah
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo

[Verse 2]
I'm a hot girl and I come in different flavours
All the hot boys got me as their screensaver
Tall green, money green just like Bottegas
Takin' off my clothes in the window for the neighbours
'Cause I'm really hot (Yeah)
Dancin' in stilettos on the table top (Whoop-whoop)
Rodeo Drive's where I like to shop (Ha)
And I can race you there in my Bentley truck (Vroom, vroom)
'Cause when I pull up and step out, I shine (Yeah)
I know Tony, I'm cuttin' the line (Hi, Tony)
Yeah, I'm buttery, creamy and fine (Mwah)
My acrylics around my white wine (Ching)
I travel 'round the globe (Yeah)
Paris Fashion Week and I'm in the front row (Bonjour)
But I'm goin' skiing even when the slopes are closed
'Cause I'm so hot with snow up my nose

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a hot girl, pop girl, rich girl
I'm a bitch girl, fast girl, catch me if you can, girl
You a swerve, girl, who the fuck are you, girl?
You just wanna be me
I'm a hot girl, pop girl, rich girl
I'm a bitch girl, fast girl, catch me if you can girl
You a swerve, girl, who the fuck are you, girl?
You just wanna be me
[Outro]
You just wanna be me
I'm a hot girl
You just wanna be me
You just wanna be me
