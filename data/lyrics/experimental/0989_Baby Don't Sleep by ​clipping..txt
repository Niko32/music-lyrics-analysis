What the fuck is you thinking? Better yet, where the fuck is you going?
Year factor, no star mapping; out here, nobody knowing
Time flying, and you figure you'd fly right along with it
Not hearing no warnings; in the morning, you go get it
Like, thruster, throttle, play that out; move a half a moon around a galaxy
You play that down like it’s nothing
Nothing out of nothing leaves you wishing every day that they was still around
Sulking in the corridor, corroding while you mill about
‘Bout a million miles a millimeter, doesn't really mean nothing
‘Cause your body is bone marrow and blood, can never be trusted
It won’t last to the nearest destination, you couldn't function
So you load into the chamber and treat sleep like it’s a punch-in
Space is wavy, follow formant, analyze it spectrally
The specter in the spectrum, on inspection, is an entity
You call it "God," or "man," or "woman"; "love" or "hope"—it's all the same
A nickel-bag philosophy, a beta boost inside a brain

[Pre-Chorus]
No home, you've been there; clearly off safety
No destination, no time for waiting
Saviors are fiction, memories fading like ghosts, ghosts
Go

[Chorus]
Baby, don't sleep; baby, don't sleep too much
Baby, don't sleep; baby, don't sleep too much
Baby, don't sleep; baby, don't sleep too much
Baby, don't sleep (Baby, don't sleep)

Conversation is tough when you think too much 'bout the metals
Most time is spent silently just monitoring your levels
Scanning for the Clay Ark and the blood pressure, and, "Stay dark"
It's off long enough so your days aren’t just arbitrary, though they are
Nothing is familiar, so the strange become the family
Analogies of old are useless—when was last you had a tree?
For reference or for reverence, irrevocable amnesty
For sure, by now, you’re so far gone, to track would be insanity
Ingrain all the membranes; you get conscience as a dark spot
Heavier than the other antimatters in your stark thoughts
Can’t shake what you’ve done no matter how far you outrun it
Mask that with the false fact that somebody is coming
Delusional is easier than self-examination
But you gotta make a choice of where you're going because staying is surrendering
Since you might be the last, that’s not an option
Get your shit together, loverboy—stop looking at the clock

[Pre-Chorus]
No home, you've been there; clearly off safety
No destination, no time for waiting
Saviors are fiction, memories fading like ghosts, ghosts
Go

[Chorus]
Baby, don't sleep; baby, don't sleep too much
Baby, don't sleep; baby, don't sleep too much
Baby, don't sleep; baby, don't sleep too much
Baby, don't sleep (Baby, don't sleep)
