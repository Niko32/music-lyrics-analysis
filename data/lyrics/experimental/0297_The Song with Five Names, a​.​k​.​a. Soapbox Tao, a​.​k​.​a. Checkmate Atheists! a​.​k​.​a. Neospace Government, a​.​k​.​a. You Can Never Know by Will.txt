Why, I can’t see, that I am the “me” that I was born into
And what’s the source of you?
In your head, in your head, in your head
And yet you believe it’s true, well you do
Like you knew anything ever
Never trust in yourself or anyone else, we’ve always all been wrong
And we built these walls strong
Even I might define, won’t deny that I’m trying while my
Eyes do defy and belie quiet liars as I
Say what I say any way I may be saying it, but
I've been wrong before

[Chorus]
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You should know better than that by now
It’s not profound to know that you could, you could
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You should know better than that by now
It’s not profound to know that you can never know
[Post-Chorus]
You can never know
You can never know
You can never know

So don’t you forget that all you project is just to protect you from
The void within the form
Yes or no isn’t null; yes it is; no, I don’t know
Yes or no? Isn’t it a silly question? Ask it anyway, 'cause
What we are is (Gotta get to the bottom of this)
What we are not (Gotta get to the bottom of this)
אֶהְיֶה אֲשֶׁר אֶהְיֶה (Gotta get to the bottom of this)
What myths must make us man?
What is “is?” What is not? What is “what?”
What’s up, party people? What?
What I wonder? Why I’m not “whatever”
What the fuck? ‘Cause

[Chorus]
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You should know better than that by now
It’s not profound to know that you could, you could
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You should know better than that by now
It’s not profound to know that you can never know
[Post-Chorus/Guitar Solo]
You can never know!
You can never know!
You can never know!
[Bridge]
I noticed that the sunshine is a gaslight
I’m hoping that this one might be my past life
My Lord, I know enough to get my facts right
And that’s good enough for me
And everything and everyone will die soon
And we’ll have nothing left for us to lie to
No matter what we seek you’ll never find truth
And that’s good enough for me
So give me that old time religion
Gimme that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It’s good enough for me
So give me that old time religion
Gimme that old time religion
Give me that old time religion
It’s good enough but not enough
To be good enough for me

[Chorus]
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You should know better than that by now
It’s not profound to know that you could, you could
You can break a shovel when you break new ground
You dig dirt up when you dig deep down
You should know better than that by now
It’s not profound to know that you can never know
