Rebel child, looking for a way, looking for a way
Your head looks unsettled, child
Looking for a way, looking for a way
I don't think you know what it takes
The daytime is going away
I'm on vibes, take this ride, we'll compromise it
She said, "Do you see love in my eyes?"

[Chorus: Jaden]
Don't talk down to me, baby, I'm drowning
I'm so glad you found me
She let me keep pink packs at her house
Man, the wrist bust down
Pink piece, yeah, and they rowdy
Matter of fact, I need you now

[Verse 1: Jaden]
She on a different continent, I got a flight again
Telling travel getting faster like a fighter jet
Always fighting, man, we don't see eye-to-eye I guess
Man, the vision so vivid, there was side effects
I was whipping down Pacific with a lot of packs
Got me feelin' psychedelic 'bout a story
Let me tell it, it's a boy in his bedroom with a pencil
'Bout to renovate the world, man, he thought he couldn't do it
Then from heaven fell a girl
She grew a marble feather in her hair
She was swimming through the air
Then she turned to him and looked
And said, "Do you think that we would work?"

Don't talk down to me, baby, I'm drowning
I'm so glad you found me
She let me keep pink packs at her house
Man, the wrist bust down
Pink slip when they rowdy
Matter of fact, I need you now

[Post-Chorus: Jaden]
Roll around the city so cloudy
Girl, come back to the house
Come lay down on the couch with me
We ain't got no business going out

[Verse 2: Jaden]
Oh, girl, I miss your love, I miss your love
This ERYS all I know
You the one I'm thinking of, I need your touch
But you leave me all alone when I hop out
Got me dreamin' I was kissing the stars
We was running on the beach, girl, my head is so dark
She told me "I could never leave", then she gave me her heart
I told her

[Chorus: Jaden]
Don't talk down to me, baby, I'm drowning
I'm so glad you found me
She let me keep it back to the house
Man, the wrist bust down
Pink slip when they rowdy
Matter of fact, I need you now
[Post-Chorus: Jaden]
Roll around the city so cloudy
Girl, come back to the house
Come lay down on the couch with me
We ain't got no business going out

[Bridge: Willow]
He took his glass and filled it with the sea
I had one drink and everything turned pink

[Beat Switch]

[Interlude: Jaden]
Time to get it
Got the vision, shoelace in the spot
Got a fist full of guap, 'bout to-

[Beat Switch]

[Verse 3: Jaden]
We the fireplace, lotta big flames
When I showed up, swear the club was going sideways
Man, they try to hate, I can't reciprocate
They think they right, I'm going left until they get it straight
I gotta switch up on the game, I gotta innovate
I gotta get that extra quinoa on my dinner plate
Switch the program, it ain't working with their interface
Man, they thought they was the hottest 'til the winter came
All these posers make me wanna fucking suffocate, ayy
Get a closeup, I just gave myself another fade
All the opposition always wanna run away
Need a feature from me, I'ma need a hunnid K
Yuh, bust down, mouth out in Venice (Venice)
Ball with the neck, all tennis (Tennis)
All y'all talk too heavy (Heavy)
Have my young boys go get 'em
Pink Crown Vic, no Benzes, huh
My jeweler a dentist, yuh
They saw my drip and had a wet dream
That's a hell of a fetish
Night sky, let's go get it
Tell 'em I only eat lettuce
They'll never know where my head is, dawg
True shit, that's why I said it
Impressed with- forget it
MSFTS run too reckless
Always got the dark cloud above me, lil' homie
I'm dripping forever
Bust down my umbrella
I'm the next one, go tell 'em
How many hundreds he selling?
And I just killed Coachella
