Huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh

[Chorus]
Big bottle of dirty water
Onto the street, walk around dirty Pradas, I feel like F1lthy
Gotta win something, just let me have it
Just let me hold something, I'm not an expert

[Verse 1]
If you stand for nothing, what would you fall for?
Fell through a trap door, turned to an actor
Just let me try one time, that's all I ask for
That's all I ask for, nothing too special
If we could merge to one, then we could build something
To recreate myself, I have to kill something
If you would want me dead, I would be into it
I just want your attention

[Bridge]
Be my star, three wishes (Three wishes)
One that is you (One that is you)
I'm almost gone, grey city
Darkness falls again, one last time
You might also like[Verse 2]
Step on spiders in my Prada loafers
Got them in Austria
Windows open because I got claustrophobia
Paranoid but I feel sober
DG9 CEO striker, bloody Nikes
Living dirty forever, trying to die nicer
Dio, freeze you, I'm a icer
Dirty weed, it smell like rubber
I've been workin' undercover
I can't go out like a sucker
Bloodless I don't wanna go there
Run the city like it's Gotham
Link ten bags, I had to lock 'em
Virgin blood, I like it fresh man
See three stars, I must collect them
Evil calling, I neglect it
Ecco2k, we talkin' to dolphins
I won't talk to no imposter
Quit this shit, I pulled the Joker
Sit down with me, start it over
Hot or cold, I'm coming closer
I can't go out like a loser
I can't go out when it's sunny

[Chorus]
Big bottle of dirty water
I do the street, walk around with dirty Pradas, I feel like F1lthy
Gotta win something, just let me have it
Just let me hold something, I'm not an expert
[Outro]
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh, huh, huh, huh
Huh (Damn), huh (Shh)
