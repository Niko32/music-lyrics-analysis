Jane Cum
In a year, I'll say, "Your hair got long"
And you'll tell me how the band got good
Like dust kicked up from a tire

[Verse 2]
Full force through the high beams
I was rushing from phantom pain
Sweat away our clothes hatching

[Chorus]
Jane Cum, you swallow me whole
Jane Cum, swallow

[Verse 3]
Soulless animal, keep feeding on my meat
All my tiny bones between your teeth

[Chorus]
Jane Cum, you swallow me whole
Jane Cum, swallow

[Outro]
