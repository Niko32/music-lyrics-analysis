Now that I know what I know
There's nothing new under the moon
Spent many nights on you
Oh I, oh I

[Verse]
I don't give a damn 'cause it don't make a difference
I can't get mad 'cause I know I went missin'
Cupid takes aim and puts holes in ambition
Can't go back home 'til I finish the mission

[Chorus]
Now that I know (Now, now), what I know (What I)
There's nothing new (Nothing), under the moon (Oh, no)
Spent many nights (Many), on you (On you)
Oh I (Oh, oh), oh I (Oh, oh)

[Outro]
Complexities, come get with me
In spite of these complexities
Complexities, come get with me
In spite of these complexitiesYou might also like
