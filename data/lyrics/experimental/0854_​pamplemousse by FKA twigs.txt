You know you love it
You know you love—
You know, you know, you kno, you know
You know you love it

[Verse]
Me and the girls with our phones out (Know)
Eight Simi-Haze-looking Girl Scouts, wow
Weave smells like La Croix, pamplemousse
Moon stars in your face
Vogue filter face
Talk to me, swipe up to dream
Tap my heart and make it feel like you see me

[Chorus]
You know you love it (Love)
You know you love (Love)
You love to tell 'em that you don't, but yeah, you love it (Love it)
You know you love it (Huh)
Gotta get you some (Yeah)
Get that attention, yeah, you love it (Never slow it down)
You know you love it (Love)
You know you love (Love)
You love to tell 'em that you don't, but yeah, you love it (Love it)
You know you love it (Huh)
Better get you some (Yeah)
Get that attention, yeah, you love it (Never slow it down)

Okay, twigs
I know everyone probably annoys you about this
But that song with Dua Lipa, "Why Don't You Love Me Anymore"
When are you gonna release it?
I'm tired of listening to it on loop—
Listen, when it came out, I was goin' through a breakup
I used to walk around Paris, with, on repeat, for this song
We need it to be released, please, twigs, come on
Make my wish come true
