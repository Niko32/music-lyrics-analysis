If she don't love me
What can I do?
Just put on my best pair of shoes
Because, oh, I'm me
Because she said, "He's the one
That drill the charms
Honey, that's so wrong"
I just want to know what's wrong with me
Being in love with you?
(Yeah)
(Hey, Frank!)

[Verse 1: Sonny Cheeba]
Yeah
Ninth grade had the jingles of the swinging rainbow jacket
Lost lingo, Bronx's only Django
Snap, he'd got less tougher
That's where my props go
That's where my pops went
See, my percentage is a pennant to the planet
Knock it out the ball park, Frankie
I should not tire this tire
To a better love, let the wings spread
It'll always come back, baby
Come back, shellac black, baby
A comeback, flat black paint on a Chevy
You might also like[Chorus: Six Boys in Trouble]
If she don't love me, what can I do?
Just put on my best pair of shoes
Because, oh, I'm me
Because, yeah, I'm me
Because, oh, I'm me
Because I'm me, I'm me

[Verse 2: Sonny Cheeba]
Never mind my tone when I told Pretty Tony
Listen to my tone, you ain't catchin' you a Tony
Award-winning walk when you running with a shottie
Why you running from us?
Why you messing with us?
We ain't got no guns, we just let the bears witness
The Grizzly, maybe Polar
You ain't ready, you ain't ready 'ready rolled up
Pulling a machete, cut the bamboo paper
And let's roll out, baby, like Frankie

[Chorus: Six Boys in Trouble]
I just want to know
What's wrong with me?

[Instrumental Break]
[Spoken Outro]
Watch the shit, it's good
