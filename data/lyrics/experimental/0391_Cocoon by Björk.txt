Who would have known
That a boy like him
Would have entered me lightly
Restoring my blisses?
Who would have known
That a boy like him
After sharing my core
Would stay going nowhere?

[Chorus]
Who would have known
A beauty this immense?
Who would have known
A saintly trance?
Who would have known
Miraculous breath?
To inhale a beard
Loaded with courage

[Verse 2]
Who would have known
That a boy like him
Possessed of magical
Sensitivity?
Who would approach a girl like me
Who caresses, cradles his head
In her bosom?
You might also like[Verse 3]
He slides inside
Half awake, half asleep
We faint back
Into sleephood
When I wake up
The second time
In his arms, gorgeousness
He's still inside me

[Chorus]
Who would have known?
Who, who would have known?
A train of pearls
Cabin by cabin
Is shot precisely
Across an ocean

[Outro]
From a mouth
From a
From the mouth
Of a girl like me
To a boy
To a boy
To a boy
