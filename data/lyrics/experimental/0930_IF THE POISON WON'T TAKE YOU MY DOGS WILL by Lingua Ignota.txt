Aileen
I'll only say this once
I am the best friend you'll ever have
All this, all this is meaningless
Without me

So will you join me?
Will you join me?
If you lay your life down, no man can take it

Will you join me?
Will you join me?
Abandon your body so no man can break it

Aileen
I'll only say this once
Life is cruel, and time heals nothing
And everyone you love will leave you
But not me

So will you join me?
Will you join me?
If you lay your life down, no man can take it
You might also likeWill you join me?
Will you join me?
Will you join me?
Make worthless your body, so no man can break it
Humble yourself
If the poison won't take you my dogs will
Unburden yourself
No shadow will darken your door like mine will

Kyrie eleison
