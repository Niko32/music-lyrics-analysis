DJ Varg in the mix
Dirty hands
You make it look so easy
(Drain Gang)

[Chorus]
I need a break, can I live?
I need to change something quick
I pay the price for the sin
I'm at the gate, let me in (At the gate, let me in)
I take my life for the risk
I roll a dice, need a six

[Bridge]
Red and black blood, I bleed for you
Dirty my life, I clean for you
Dirty my life, I clean for you
Dirty my life, I clean for you
I dream of life, it might come true
I dream of life, it might come true

[Chorus]
I need a break, can I live?
I need to change something quick
I pay the price for the sin
I'm at the gate, let me in (At the gate, let me in)
I take my life for the risk
I roll a dice, need a six
(Drain Gang)

Plastic bag, dirty glue, dripping on my shoe
And I'm on my ones, trying to drink a juice
Backstab what you choose, what you trying to do?
Evil spirits in my head, they're trying to get to you
New face, good guy, the raven got far
Cut up three times, "T" stands for Trash Star
I hear you whisper, I know it gets hard
You'll always be with me, birth mark, dust park
I lost my face twice, so I cannot play nice
I spit myself out, yeah, it doesn't taste right
Fuck the world, love the world that's in my mind (It's bad)
Reap what you sow in the night time (It's bad)
Kill for me

[Bridge]
It's bad, it's bad

[Verse 2]
I'm not the one, it's a scam
Wash my dirty hands
I am not the one
Blood upon my tongue
I'm not the one, it's a scam
Stay up on the job
I do not deserve
I am not of worth
I'm the one four times
Tell them hit my line
Tell you that it's fine
But you know I'm lying
I'm not the one, it's a scam
Off the dirty xans
Off the dirty grams
[Outro]
One cell
One cell
