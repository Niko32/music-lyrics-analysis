GAWVI, get 'em

[Verse 1: Andy Mineo]
Ooh, I feel like Usain in the cheetah print
Talk fresh game, I don't need a mint
RIP the game, shh, I need a minute
Ok, let's proceed with it
I'm in the house, gotta deed with it
These bozos always sneak dissin'
They takin' shots, I'm Hakeem with it
Like no, no, this league business (No, no)
Who you really know?
I've been movin' under oath
Yeah, my connect is way up
I don't keep it on the low
So tell my fam I'll be ok
I sleep right where that reaper play
Even if I DOA I wake up and I see glory
'Scuse my French, s'il vous plait
Ain't no bench, we don't play
You might catch me on the "A"
End the verse like Salt Bae, ayy
League

[Hook: Andy Mineo]
'Bout to be some havoc like it's Mobb Deep
Vrrrm, 'bout to hit the top speed
Uh, ayo GAWVI when you drop the beat
Make sure you wish 'em God speed
Uh, zoom
Vroom, vroom, vroom

In my bag, yeah, I don't play (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Way too much to navigate, you know my ways
Who come test me? Bet that tomb is empty
Know you can't offend me, talk that trash, my crew is hefty, oh
KB, KB, KB you so FLA, yes
I just let that Son shine, every word I state, yeah (Yeah)
Who that, who that, who that? That's that HGA (HGA)
Kingdom on my lips, that's hallowed be thy name, yeah
Too much sauce, sofrito all on my bars
Every Latino, my sauce
Sazon with that pollo, frita loco
My dog's from New York, Haiti, global, South the coast
All around the world support
Jesus, yes, that's all we want
God speed!

'Bout to be some havoc like it's Mobb Deep (Mobb Deep)
