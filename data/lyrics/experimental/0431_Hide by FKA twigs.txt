Space
The only thing I ever knew
Place
With the time I know I'll have to choose, now

[Chorus 1]
Stay beneath the ground
Hide away from you
I'd sink into the crowd
If it meant that I'd escape your eye

[Verse 2]
Hate
The only thing I give to you, now
Face me
If you think that you can take another route, out

[Chorus 2]
I let my sight be slayed
If it meant that I could form a view
(Hide away from you)
I found another way
To caress my day, todayYou might also like
