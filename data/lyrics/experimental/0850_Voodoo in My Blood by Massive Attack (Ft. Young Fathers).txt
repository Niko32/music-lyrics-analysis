Voodoo in my blood is livid
Blood take, I'm chillin'
Chill me got the soul of a mimic
It's not quite right, you must be a cynic
Sign of the wars is my grinning
Come in to my time and see me
Sock it to me, sock it to me, timid

[Pre-Chorus: Young Fathers]
I'm yours, I'm yours
Why does the blood always stick to your teeth?
Momma, stop giving me grief!
Why does the blood always stick to your teeth?
Momma, stop giving me grief!
Why does the blood always stick to your teeth?
Momma, stop giving me grief!

[Chorus: Young Fathers]
Barely, barely grieving
Keep the front door open
Wipe that cheeky grin and come on, now
Barely, barely grieving
Keep the front door open
Wipe that cheeky grin and come on, now
