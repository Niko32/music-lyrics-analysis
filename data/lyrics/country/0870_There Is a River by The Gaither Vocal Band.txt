And it flows from deep within
There is a fountain
That frees the soul from sin
Come to this water
There is a vast supply
There is a river
That never shall run dry

And there was a thirsty woman
She was drawing from the well
You see, her life was ruined and wasted
And her soul was bound for hell
Oh, but then she met the Master
And He told about her sin
And He said, "If you'll drink this water
You'll never thirst again"

There is a river
And it flows from deep within
There is a fountain
That frees the soul from sin
Oh, come to this water
There is a vast supply
There is a river
That never shall run dryYou might also like
