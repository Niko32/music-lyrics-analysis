The frost, it looks like dust settled on the world
After everyone's long been gone
But me, I was hidin', or forgotten, the only one left
Now the world is mine alone

[Chorus]
With no one, no one to share the memory
Of frost out the window
This morning after you're gone
And the house is mine alone

[Verse 2]
You're my best friend, now I've no one to tell
How I lost my best friend
The frost, it looks like we've been left in the attic
But you're not here to see

[Outro]
It's just witness-less meYou might also like
