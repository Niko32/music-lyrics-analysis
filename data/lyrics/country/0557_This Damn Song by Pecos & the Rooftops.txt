Well, I don't wanna hear the good side of this goodbye
If you wanna go, baby, just leave
Don't tell me that you still care and that I'll always be special
'Cause those words don't mean a damn thing
And hate that I'm still up, drunk as fuck
4 a.m. writin' this damn song
But I guess I'm okay, not bein' okay
Give it time and I'll soon move on (Mm)

[Verse 1]
You said my life was too fucked up to be with you
But here you go to the bar 'til two
And I wanna know what he has that I don't
Well, I was ready for the real thing
No more shame in this life I live because I would change for you
Don't know the hope you gave to me
But I guess I'm okay, just need some cocaine
And a bottle that'll float my mind
Take a trip to another world, where you would be mine

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna hear the good side of this goodbye
If you wanna go, baby, just leave
Don't tell me that you still care and that I'll always be special
'Cause those words don't mean a damn thing
And I hate that I'm still up, drunk as fuck
4 a.m. writin' this damn song
But, I guess that I'm okay, not bein' okay
Give it time, baby, I'll move on

I found a couple of your long hairs in the passenger seat
Where you looked over and smiled at me
I guess a picture ain't worth as many words as they say
And don't tell me that it's okay, I'll find my own way
Don't need your excuse to ease my pain
I guess it's just time for me to work on me

[Chorus]
And I don't wanna hear the good side, there ain't no good side
You ain't ever gonna see what I see
Don't tell me that you still care and you'll always be there
'Cause those words are just messin' with me
I hate that I'm still up, drunk as fuck
4 a.m. writin' this damn song
But, I guess I'm okay, not bein' okay
Give it time, baby, I'll move on
