Sunshine beatin' on the good times
Moonlight raisin' from the grave
String band playing worn-out honky-tonks
Pretty young thing goin' dancin' in the rain

[Verse 2]
High-heel lady spittin' at the nickajacks
Businessman with a needle and a spoon
Coyote chewin' on a cigarette
Pack o' young boys goin' howlin' at the moon

[Chorus]
Hey darlin', sleepin' on the blacktop
Hey darlin', runnin' through the trees, honey
Hey darlin', leavin' for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me

[Verse 3]
Three dead in a crash on the number 4
Two witnesses below and up high
Not sure whose will be done
You can call me a sinner for wonderin' why

[Chorus]
Hey darlin' sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin', running through the trees, honey
Hey darlin', leaving for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me

[Verse 4]
Corn liquor tastes sweeter in this town
Could it be it's the same as the last?
I swear I've seen your face elsewhere before
Just as familiar as a bottle and a glass

[Chorus]
Hey darlin', sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin', running through the trees, honey
Hey darlin', leaving for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me
Hey darlin', sleeping on the blacktop
Hey darlin', running through the trees, honey
Hey darlin', leaving for the next town
Less'n my sense catches up with me

[Outro]
Less'n my sense catches up with me
