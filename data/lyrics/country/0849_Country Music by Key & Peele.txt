Well, I'm just a good old american boy
With a heart that's red, white, and true
I'm dreamin' of the girl with the red hair and freckles
And her eyes like the skies of blue
Keep her safe from the homies in the wrong side of town
Where they're smokin' the reefer and acting like clowns
Keep that pretty white dress from getting dirty and brown
'Cause that's the American way

Some folks wear their hats way off to the side
With their pants down low and a gun tucked inside
Take their beer by the 40 and their chicken deep-fried
I think we all know who we're talking about
The only dark I like is when I turn off the lights
The only hood I love is pointy and white
Can't trust you if I can't see your face at night
I think we all know who we're talking abou-

Hidey-lidely-lidely-lee
Gimme a rope and find me a tree

The banjos are strummin'
And the drums are a-banging
Let's get the boys together, and have ourselves a hangi-
