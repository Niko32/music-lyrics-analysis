And a small bag to go pick someone up
And a small jar that burns me with its coldness
Three, four very beautiful barbies to dance with
The sun in the distance I see pass
My homie passes me a tobacco to roll up
I can feel my heart starting to beat
It had been a while without feeling that
I don't know what that is, I think they call them butterflies

[Verse 2]
It's been a long time and I can't stop looking at her
Beautiful lips, a spectacular face
I approach her and the truth is, I don't know if I should greet her
But it's not something bad, I should just do it
What a beautiful girl, believe me, that was the truth
I touched her shoulder and she instantly looks at me
Her hand touches me and leads me to dance
I was crazy about the way she looked at me
And as she approaches me and makes me dance
Her body close to mine would make me vibrate
But I'm scared and I don't want to fall in love
But it's late and believe me, I like this

[Interlude]

Two, three songs and she doesn't stop dancing
I don't care as long as I'm with her
Three, four drinks and the party gets better
We met while the song was playing
I don't even have to tell y'all, y'all already know what happened
She rolled in my bed and just as the sun came up
We slept together, she had me going insane
And here ends the story of this tale

[Verse 4]
I'm still here, in the club, smoking a blunt
Always watching out in case I come across her
Days go by and I haven't seen her again
I pray to God to make her come back now
I close my eyes and I remember her face
How she danced, smiled, and her particular gaze
Moon, tell her that you can see her now
Tell her to come back and that I'll wait for her here
