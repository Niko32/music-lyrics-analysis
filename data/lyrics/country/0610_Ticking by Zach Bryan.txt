I'm cuttin' ties with things that bind my heart to this world
I love you and I'm willin' but I cannot keep you, girl
Philly by the morning and Ohio by the night
The thing about a long rope is you can't hold on too tight

[Verse 2]
Wooden floors and coffee cups
Stepped on and all used up
But I reckon that's what mornings are for
And everyone thinks they know me now
In these close-minded leave-me towns
But I'm too young to even know myself

[Chorus]
There's wheels runnin' down the interstate
Lord, I'll wait another day, 'cause I ain't close to you
There's time tickin' on the interstate
And Lord, I hate that I ain't close to you

[Verse 2]
And all my friends have moved away
Some got jobs and some got saved
They talk to me like I'm still that kid
The fightin', fiendin', Okie son
The restless, reckless, hopeful one
Who once was proud of everything he did
Do you remember twenty-five
Long legs and lovin' time?
Seems like ten lifetimes ago
I'm cuttin' ties with things that bind my heart to this world
I love you and I'm willin', but I really have to go
You might also like[Chorus]
There's wheels runnin' down the interstate
But, Lord, I'll wait another day, 'cause I ain't close to you
There's time tickin' on the interstate
I'm fightin' fate
And, Lord, I hate that I ain't close to you

[Outro]
I'm cuttin' ties with things that bind my heart to this world
I love you and I'm willing, but I cannot keep you, girl
Philly by the morning and Ohio by the night
The thing about high hopes is you can't hold on too tight
