No one wants to stay at home
Nobody wants to be alone
When you come knocking, I'll be at your door
I don't ever wanna stop
I'm gonna give it all I've got
And when they ask me, "Who could ask for more?"

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't stand still
I won't slow down

[Chorus]
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
I wanna go out dancing

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna go out
I wanna go out dancing

[Verse 2]
This is where I wanna be with you
Your arms wrapped around me
And fireworks reflecting in your eyes
This is how I wanna feel
The wine, the kiss, the music real
And getting down, riding all the highs
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Can't stand still
I won't slow down

[Chorus]
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
I wanna go out dancing

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna go out
I wanna go out dancing

[Bridge]
Everybody's got a story
Let it be your blaze of glory
Burning bright, never fade away
And when the final curtain falls, we could say we did it all
The never ending of a perfect day

[Pre-Chorus]
Can't stand still
(Can't stand still)
I won't slow down
(Won't slow down)
[Chorus]
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
When I go out, I wanna go out dancing
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
I wanna go out dancing

[Post-Chorus]
I wanna go out
I wanna go out
(I wanna go out dancing)
I wanna go out
I wanna go out
(I wanna go out dancing)
