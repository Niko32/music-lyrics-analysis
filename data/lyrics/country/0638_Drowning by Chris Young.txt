Still got your number in my phone
And even though you don't know I listen
I still call and wait 'til the tone
Just to hear you saying, "Leave a message"
Since you've been gone I've had to find
Different ways to grieve
There's days that I don't even want it on my mind
But tonight I'm weak

[Chorus]
So I'm gonna pull out pictures, ones with you in 'em
Laugh and cry a little while reminiscin'
By myself, I can't help
That all I think about is
How you were taken way too soon
It ain't the same here without you
I gotta say missin' you comes in waves
And tonight I'm drowning

[Verse 2]
Yeah, I know you're in a better place
And one day I'll see you again
But it's killin' me we can't be face to face
I miss my best friend, so tonight
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm gonna pull out pictures, ones with you in 'em
Laugh and cry a little while reminiscin'
By myself, I can't help
That all I think about is
How you were taken way too soon
It ain't the same here without you
I gotta say missin' you comes in waves
And tonight I'm drowning

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, tonight I'm drowning

[Bridge]
I know it's a part of life
But I wasn't ready to say goodbye

[Chorus]
So tonight I'm gonna pull out pictures, ones with you in 'em
Laugh and cry a little while reminiscin'
By myself, I can't help
That all I think about is
How you were taken way too soon
It ain't the same here without you
I gotta say missin' you comes in waves
And tonight I'm drowning
[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, tonight I'm drowning
