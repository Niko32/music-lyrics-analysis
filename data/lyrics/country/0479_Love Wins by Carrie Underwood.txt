A stray bullet and a mama cries
Her baby won't be comin' home tonight
Sirens screamin' down the avenue
Just another story on the evening news, oh, whoa

[Verse 2]
Politics and prejudice
How the hell'd it ever come to this?
When everybody's gotta pick a side
It don't matter if you're wrong or right, no

[Pre-Chorus]
And so it goes
But I hold onto hope and I won't let go ‘cause

[Chorus]
I… I believe
You and me are sisters and brothers
And I… I believe
We're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah, I… I believe
In the end love wins
You might also like[Verse 3]
Sometimes it takes a lot of faith
To keep believin' there will come a day
When the tears and the sadness, the pain and the hate
The struggle, this madness, will all fade away, yeah

[Chorus]
I… I believe
You and me are sisters and brothers
And I… I believe
We're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah, I… I believe
In the end love wins

[Bridge]
Love is power, love is a smile
Love reaches out, love is the remedy
Love is the answer, love's an open door
Love is the only thing worth fightin' for, yeah

[Chorus]
I… I believe
You and me are sisters and brothers
And I… I believe
We're made to be here for each other
And we'll never fall if we walk hand in hand
Put a world that seems broken together again
Yeah, I… I believe
In the end love wins
[Outro]
Love will, love can, love still, love wins
Love will, love can, love still, love wins
