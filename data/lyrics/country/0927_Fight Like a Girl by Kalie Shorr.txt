He’s calling out my name
He says I'm, just a featherweight
He thinks the slightest breeze could blow me over
What he doesn’t know is I've got a slingshot and a stone
And I can win with no one in my corner
So don't you even try to hold me back

[Chorus]
I got my high heels on with my boxing gloves
I can knock you out with a one-two punch
I'm perfume sweet and whiskey strong
I damn sure ain't no underdog
I might fall down but I get back up
I shine brightest when the going's tough
You say I can't - well, darling, watch me
You can't stop me 'cause I fight like a girl

[Verse 2]
I'm little but I'm loud
Just wanna make my mama proud
And you can tell without a doubt that I'm her daughter
She raised me to believe
That I can be anything
So when you push me I'll just push back harder
You might also like[Chorus]
I got my high heels on with my boxing gloves
I can knock you out with a one-two punch
I'm perfume sweet and whiskey strong
I damn sure ain't no underdog
I might fall down but I get back up
I shine brightest when the going's tough
You say I can't - well, darling, watch me
You can't stop me 'cause I fight like a girl

[Bridge]
I fight hard, I fight tough, I fight fair
Won't stop fighting until I get there
No, I ain't afraid to cry
Everybody's gotta feel something sometimes
I fight hard, I fight tough, I fight fair
Won't stop fighting until I get there
No, I ain't afraid to cry
I ain't afraid to fight

[Chorus]
I got my high heels on with my boxing gloves
I can knock you out with a one-two punch
I'm perfume sweet and whiskey strong
I damn sure ain't no underdog
I might fall down but I get back up
I shine brightest when the going's tough
You say I can't - well, darling, watch me
You can't stop me 'cause I fight like a girl
[Outro]
I fight hard, I fight tough, I fight fair
Won't stop fighting 'til I get there
No, I ain't afraid to fight
I fight like a girl
