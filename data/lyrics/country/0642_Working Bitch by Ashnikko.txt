I'm a working bitch
Ain't got no time for dick
You wish you could sway my attention
I'm working, bitch
Ain't got no time for dick
Sure as fuck can't sway my attention

[Verse 1]
Too tired to entertain little boys
I'm the boss of my business, I should invoice, and
One strike, two, I'm self-employed
Swear my blue vibrator brings me more joy
If you wanna play second fiddle to my job
Wanna be side-dick in a one-stop shop
Let me know, huh
Let me know, huh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I do well for myself, nothing you do is extraordinary
Taxing on my mental health and my last boyfriend was cautionary

[Chorus]
I'm a working bitch
Ain't got no time for dick
You wish you could sway my attention
I'm working, bitch
Ain't got no time for dick
Sure as fuck can't sway my attention

I love my, I love my, I love my, I love my
I love my day job, fuck a blowjob, what's the point?
It's all déjà vu, they don't give me what I want
Money, make some, makin' money better than the dick
Pussy Play-Doh, pussy like her pockets, thick
Now he look stressed 'cause he know that I don't need him
Mouth open, baby bird, I'm not gonna feed him
Yeah, I'm big, I'm boss

[Chorus]
I'm a working bitch
Ain't got no time for dick
You wish you could sway my attention
I'm working, bitch
Ain't got no time for dick
Sure as fuck can't sway my attention

[Post-Chorus]
'Cause I do well for myself,  nothing you do is extraordinary
Taxing on my mental health and my last boyfriend was cautionary

[Bridge]
I'm a working bitch
Working bitch
Working bitch
[Chorus]
I'm a working bitch
Ain't got no time for dick
You wish you could sway my attention
I'm working, bitch
Ain't got no time for dick
Sure as fuck can't sway my attention

[Outro]
I'm a working bitch
Working bitch
Working bitch
I'm a working bitch
Working bitch
Work-working bitch
I'm a working bitch
