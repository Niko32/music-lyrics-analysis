I know your life on earth was troubled
And only you could know the pain
You weren't afraid to face the devil
You were no stranger to the rain

[Chorus]
So go rest high on that mountain
Son, your work on earth is done
Go to heaven a-shoutin'
Love for the Father and the Son

[Verse 2]
Oh, how we cried the day you left us
We gathered round your grave to grieve
Wish I could see the angels faces
When they hear your sweet voice sing

[Chorus]
So go rest high on that mountain
Son, your work on earth is done
Go to heaven a-shoutin'
Love for the Father and the Son

[Instrumental Break]

You're safely home in the arms of Jesus
Eternal life, my brother's found
The day will come, I know I'll see you
That sacred place on that Holy ground

[Chorus]
Go rest high on that mountain
'Cause son, your work on earth is done
Go to heaven a-shoutin'
Love for the Father and the Son

[Outro]
Go to heaven a-shoutin'
Love for the Father and the Son
