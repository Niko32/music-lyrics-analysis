[Chorus]
I finally quit smokin' cigarettes
And I don't go downtown drinkin' 'til it's dawn
The best parts of you are here, but you're still gone

[Verse]
And, Lord, I've been tryin' to smile like you told me
Laugh like the old me, it comes out all wrong
The best parts of you are here, but you're still gone
And I still tie that double knot
The one you taught, that gets caught on the banks
The best parts of you are here, but you still ain't

[Chorus]
I finally quit smokin' cigarettes
And I don't go downtown drinkin' 'til it's dawn
The best parts of you are here but you'rе still gone
[Part II: Long Island]

[Verse]
I heard your father got sick of Long Island
I'vе been tryin' like hell to call
My mind ain't well and I just can't tell you why
I heard they shut down the old bar we'd go to when we needed rest
We'd always stay out too late Tuesday nights
You said I was the perfect gentleman
You used to hold me by my gentle hands
These ain't the hopeful hands you held before
And I've been drinkin' so much lately, it seems a damn double blade
'Cause when I'm drunk I dream you're dancin' down the shore
You might also like[Chorus]
I heard your father got sick on Long Island
I've been tryin' like hell to call
My mind ain't well and I just can't tell you why
I heard they shut down the old bar we'd go to when we needed rest
We'd always stay out too late Tuesday nights

[Outro]
I heard your father got sick on Long Island
I've been tryin' like hell to call
My mind ain't well and I just can't tell you why
I heard they shut down the old bar we'd go to when we needed rest
We'd always stay out too late Tuesday nights
