All those LA west coast silicone women
Really think they're hot
But it's no fun titty fuckin' titties when the titties are hard as rocks
And up in New York City all them uptight bitties
Like to shave their cooch
But I prefer a little fur on my burger
If you're wantin' me to tell the truth

[Chorus]
I like my puss in boots
A girl who knows how to honky tonk
Hums along to a Waylon tune
While she's hummin' on my cock and balls
I want a girl in a cowboy hat
Her tongue knows where my butthole's at
Bush pokin' out her Daisy Dukes
I like my puss in boots
Boots

[Verse 2]
Well the girls in Chicago, they can spit, they can swallow
When they're on their knees
But it's hard to stay hard when you're fuckin' in a car it's four degrees
All the girls in Milwaukee wanna slob on my cocky
But I have to pass
Cause I only get wood when my dick is up a good ol' Southern ass
You might also like[Chorus]
I like my puss in boots
A girl who knows how to honky tonk
Hums along to a Willie tune
While she's hummin' on my cock and balls
I want a girl in a cowboy hat
Her tongue knows where my butthole's at
Bush pokin' out her Daisy Dukes
I like my puss in boots
Boots

[Bridge]
Don't want them high heels on
When you're slidin' up and down my dong
And keep them fuckin' flip flops and your birkenstocks
Away from my hillbilly cock

[Chorus]
I like my puss in boots
A girl who knows how to honky tonk
Hums along to a Wheeler tune
While she's hummin' on my cock and balls
I want a girl in a cowboy hat
Her tongue knows where my butthole's at
Bush pokin' out her Daisy Dukes
I like my puss in boots
Boots
