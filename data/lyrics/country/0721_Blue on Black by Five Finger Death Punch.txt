Night falls and I'm alone
Skin, yeah, chilled me to the bone
You turned and you ran, oh, yeah
Oh, slipped right from my hands

[Chorus]
Yeah
Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream, never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's like blue on black

[Verse 2]
Blind, oh, but now I see
Truth, lies, and in between
Wrong can't be undone, oh, no
Well, it slipped from the tip of your tongue

[Chorus]
Yeah
Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream, never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's like blue on black
You might also like[Solo]

[Bridge]
Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much

[Chorus]
Blue on black, tears on a river
Push on a shove, it don't mean much
Joker on jack, match on a fire
Cold on ice, a dead man's touch
Whisper on a scream, never change a thing
Doesn't bring you back
It's like blue on black

[Outro]
Yeah, blue on black
Yeah, it's blue on black
Yeah, blue on black
