Jesus' blood can make you free;
For He saved the worst among you
When He saved a wretch like me

Refrain:
And I know, yes, I know
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean
And I know, yes, I know
Jesus' blood can make the vilest sinner clean
To the faint He giveth power
Through the mountains makes a way;
Findeth water in the desert
Turns the night to golden day
In temptation He is near thee
Holds the pow'rs of hell at bay;
Guides you to the path of safety
Gives you grace for every day
He will keep thee while the ages
Roll throughout eternity;
Though earth hinders and hell rages
All must work for good to theeYou might also like
