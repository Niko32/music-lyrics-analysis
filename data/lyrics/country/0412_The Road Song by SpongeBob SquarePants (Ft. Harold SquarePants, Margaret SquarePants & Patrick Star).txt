Maybe we should all sing the road song

[Hook (repeating): Patrick Star]
Road
Road
Road
Road
Road
Road
Road
Road
Road
Road

[Verse: SpongeBob, Patrick, Margaret & Harold]
When I'm on the road
I see stuff going by
When I'm on the road
I got a bug in my eye
When I'm on the road
Looks like clear skies ahead
When I'm on the road
Please stop touching my head

[Pre-Chorus, spoken: Patrick]
Road
Road
Road
Road
Road
Road
Road
Road
Road

Let's all sing the road song
I wanna sing it all day long
Let's all sing the road song

Road, Road, Road, Road, Road
Road, Road, Road, Road)
Let's all sing along!

[Outro: Patrick]
Rooooooooad!
