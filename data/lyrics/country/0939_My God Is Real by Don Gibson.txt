There are some things I may not know
There are some places I can't go
But I am sure of this one thing
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul

[Chorus]
My God is real, real in my soul
My God is real for He has washed and He made me whole
His love for me is like pure gold
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soul

[Verse 2]
I cannot tell just how it felt
When Jesus took my sins away
But since that day, yes, since that hour
God has been real for I can feel His holy power

[Chorus]
My God is real, real in my soul
My God is real for He has washed and made me whole
His love for me is like pure gold
My God is real for I can feel Him in my soulYou might also like
