And the road seems rough and long
Sometimes my feet get weary and so sore
But a brighter day is coming
Soon I'll step on heaven's shore
And I won't have to worry anymore

I won't have to worry
When I reach the other shore
All my troubles will be over
And I'll rest forevermore
My eyes will be on Jesus
And my heart will be aglow
And I won't have to worry anymore

Someday when life is over
And I've said my last goodbyes
I'll see my Savior standing at the door
Then I'll hear Him say you're welcome
All your cares are left behind
And I won't have to worry anymore

No, I won't have to worry
When I reach the other shore
All my troubles will be over
And I'll rest forevermore
My eyes will be on Jesus
And my heart will be aglow
And I won't have to worry anymore

And my heart will be aglow
And I won't have to worry anymore
