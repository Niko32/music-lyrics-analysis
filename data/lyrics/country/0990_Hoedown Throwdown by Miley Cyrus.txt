Boom clap, boom d’clap, d’clap
Boom, boom clap, boom d’ clap, d’clap
Boom, boom clap, boom d’ clap, d’clap
Boom, boom clap, boom d’ clap, d’clap
Try it with me, here we go
Boom, boom clap, boom d’ clap, d’clap
(Whoa-oh-oh; that's right!)
Boom, boom clap, boom d’ clap, d’clap
Boom, boom clap, boom d’ clap, d’clap
(Whoa-oh-oh)
1, 2, 3! Everybody, c'mon, off your seats
I'm gonna tell you about a beat
That's gonna make you move your feet

[Verse 1]
I’ll give the bar-b-’cues’
Show and tell you how to move
If you’re 5 or 82, this is something you can do

[Pre-Chorus]
Pop it, lock it, polka dot it
Countrify, then hip-hop it
Put your hawk in the sky, move side to side
Jump to the left, stick it, glide
You might also like[Chorus]
Zig zag cross the flo’, shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits, hands on your hips
One-footed 180 twist, and then a
Zig zag, step, slide
Lean it left, clap three times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together that’s how we roll

[Post-Chorus]
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Throw it all together that’s how we roll

[Verse 2]
We get to 4, 5, 6
And you’re feelin’ busted
But it’s not time to quit
Practice makes you perfect

[Pre-Chorus]
Pop it, lock it, polka dot it
Countrify, then hip-hop it
Put your hawk in the sky, move side to side
Jump to the left, stick it, glide
[Chorus]
Zig zag cross the flo’, shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits, hands on your hips
One-footed 180 twist, and then a
Zig zag, step, slide
Lean it left, clap three times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together that’s how we roll

[Post-Chorus]
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Throw it all together that’s how we roll

[Breakdown]
Boom d'clap, d'clap, boom boom clap
C'mon, here we go!
Boom boom clap, boom d'clap, d'clap
Boom boom clap, boom d'clap

[Pre-Chorus]
Pop it, lock it, polka dot it
Countrify, then hip-hop it
Put your hawk in the sky, move side to side
Jump to the left, stick it, glide
[Chorus]
Zig zag cross the flo’, shuffle in diagonal
When the drum hits, hands on your hips
One-footed 180 twist, and then a
Zig zag, step, slide
Lean it left, clap three times
Shake it out, head to toe
Throw it all together that’s how we roll

[Post-Chorus]
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Throw it all together that’s how we roll
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Do the hoedown, throwdown
Throw it all together that’s how we roll

[Outro]

Boom dap clap, b-boom d'clap clap
Boom d'clap, boom d'clap d'clap
Throw it all together, that's how we roll
