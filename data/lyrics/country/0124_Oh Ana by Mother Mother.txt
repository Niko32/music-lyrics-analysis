I'll be God
I'll be God, I'll be God, I'll be God today
Hold my head under that bath and breathe away
Slit my wrists and watch that blood evaporate
Being this godly can't be good for
Ana's safety, Ana hear me

[Verse 2]
I'll play God
I'll play God, I'll play God, I'll play God today
Ante up and play that god a poker game
Walk away with all our little God's spare change
Playing this god it can't be good for
Ana's safety, Ana hear me

[Chorus]
Oh Ana, I'll be with you still
You are the angel that I couldn't kill

[Verse 3]
I'll fake God
I'll fake God, I'll fake God, I'll fake God today
Hop up on a cloud and watch the world decay
Ana on my shoulders and we'll laugh away
Faking this god it can't be good for
Ana's safety, Ana hear me
Ana baby, I'm not crazy
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh Ana, Oh Ana
Oh, Ana, I'll be with you still
You are the angel that I couldn't kill
Kill, kill, kill, kill

[Chorus]
Oh, Ana, I'll be with you still
You are the angel that I couldn't kill
Ana, I'll be with you still
You are the angel that I couldn't ki-i-ill
I couldn't ki-i-ill
I couldn't ki-i-ill
I couldn't ki-i-ill

[Outro]
No, I couldn't ki-i-ill
No, I couldn't ki-i-ill
No, I couldn't kill Ana
Oh Ana
