I was scared, I wasn't quite ready yet
Didn't want to let my freedom get
Too far away so I would say anything
To keep you just close enough
Like I need a little space to breathe
A little time for me to think
I just need you to wait for me
But you weren't waiting for me

[Chorus]
To grow up, get my shit together
Stop giving you the runaround, running from forever
It's too bad we happened when we did
'Cause I've learned a lot about life since then
I can't go back, girl I hate that
You fell in love with a kid trying to figure it out
'Cause I'm man enough now

[Verse 2]
I guess it's something that every boys gotta do
Getting so close but letting it slip through
Your fingers yeah, you gotta learn the hard way
Once you do you start to look back on
All the things that you should've, would've, could've done
Bet you never thought that I would
You might also like[Chorus]
Grow up, get my shit together
Stop giving you the runaround, running from forever
It's too bad we happened when we did
'Cause I've learned a lot about life since then
I can't go back, girl I hate that
You fell in love with a kid trying to figure it out
'Cause I'm man enough

[Bridge]
To push my pride out of the way
Make a girl like you wanna stay
It took a while for me to come around
But I am man enough now

[Outro]
I grew up, got it all together
I stopped running from forever
It's too bad we happened when we did
'Cause I've learned a lot about life since then
I can't go back, girl I hate that
You fell in love with a kid trying to figure it out
So if one more chance is something that you ever think about
I'm man enough now
I'm man enough now
