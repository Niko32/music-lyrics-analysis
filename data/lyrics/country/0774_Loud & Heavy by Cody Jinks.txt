Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away

[Verse 1]
Pistons pumping
Minds are racing
It's hard to sleep man
When I'm shaking
Bad news surrounds me
Its always found me
Creeping up when things are good
Yeah the dark days find a way

[Chorus]
Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
You might also like[Verse 2]
The camera captures
All the things that
Make us turn from
What we see
It's always moving
It don't stop rolling
I haven't slept in three damn days
Yeah, but who needs that anyway?

[Chorus]
Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
It's a long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Living life through the night
Thin line of a lightning strike
Sometimes the only light
When the moon is tucked away
[Outro]
Loud thunder heavy rain
Loud thunder heavy rain
Thin line between joy and pain
A long strange trip it's all insane
You ain't never gonna be the same
Loud thunder heavy rain
Loud thunder heavy rain
