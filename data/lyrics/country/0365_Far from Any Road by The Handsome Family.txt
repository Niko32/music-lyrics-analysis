From the dusty mesa
Her looming shadow grows
Hidden in the branches
Of the poison creosote
She twines her spines up slowly
Towards the boiling sun
And when I touched her skin
My fingers ran with blood
[Verse 2: Rennie Sparks]
In the hushing dusk, under a swollen silver moon
I came walking with the wind to watch the cactus bloom
A strange hunger haunted me, the looming shadows danced
I fell down to the thorny brush and felt a trembling hand

[Bridge: Brett Sparks and Rennie Sparks]
When the last light warms the rocks
And the rattlesnakes unfold
Mountain cats will come to drag away your bones

[Verse 3: Brett Sparks and Rennie Sparks]
Then rise with me forever
Across the silent sands
And the stars will be your eyes
And the wind will be my handsYou might also like
