Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
We moved to a place with a view off of Eighth Avenue after we said I do
And we watched cars of bachelorettes, two A.M. cigarettes, and traffic headed downtown
And the interstate was so loud, there was a lot it had to drown out

[Chorus]
We played the part five nights, but we were never there on the weekends, baby
We got along real nice, but when I left town, did you hate me?
One day, the curtain started coming down
I changed the second we were moving out
I guess wrong can look alright
When you're playing home in a penthouse, baby

[Verse 2]
I bought the house with a fence, enough room for some kids, a backyard for Dibs
And I thought that would make it all better, and maybe forever wouldn't feel like the walls closing in
'Cause how does that even make sense?
Now that I think about it, it never did

[Chorus]
We played the part five nights, but we were never there on the weekends, baby
We got along real nice, but when I left town, did you hate me?
One day, the curtain started coming down
You changed the second we were moving out
I guess wrong can look alright
When you're playing home in a penthouse, baby
'Cause we were playing home in a penthouse, baby

It hurts putting shit in a box
And now we don't talk
And it stings rolling up the welcome mat
Knowing you got half

[Chorus]
I kissed someone new last night
But now I don't know where you're sleeping, baby
We got along real nice, until I wanted out, now I know you hate me
One day, the curtain started coming down
We changed the second we were moving out
I guess wrong can look alright
When you're playing home in a penthouse, baby
Oh, we were playing home in a penthouse, baby, hmm

[Outro]
I just bought the house that we saw
You said it was wrong
I wanted it all along
