Well I wanna send a post card
From the edge of a place I've never been
And I wanna make love hard
Under the stars in the back of a beat up ol' K-10
And I wanna love a girl who
Doesn't worry about the pictures when we kiss
Wake up one day and not be so hit-and-miss
And lay in bed all day and call that shit pure bliss

[Chorus]
I'm movin' at God speed
Only God and my mama know what I need
And I feel the hardwood floors on my knees
As I beg you just to take it easy on me
I'm movin' at God speed

[Verse 2]
Well I wanna see the road melt
Into the mountains away as I drive
And make it out of this damn town alive
And not let the dreams I shoulder die

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm movin' at God speed
Only God and my mama know what I need
And I feel the hardwood floors on my knees
As I beg you just to take it easy on me
You might also like[Verse 3]
Well I wanna die an old man
Messed-up stories of me and all my old friends
And laugh about how we all thought it won't end
How we all wind up where we begin

[Chorus]
Movin' at God speed
Where only God and our mamas know what we need
And we feel the hardwood floors on our knees
As we beg the world to bring us to our feet
And I'm movin' at God speed
Only God and my mama know what I need
And I feel the hardwood floors on my knees
As I beg you just to take it easy on me

[Outro]
I'm movin' at God speed
