And there was a very sacred place home back where I grew
Between three old pine trees that nobody knew
I'd close my eyes and pass the time like youngin's often do
But now I'm long gone, completely ruined

Darlin' you and I were made for many different things
To live and learn and lie and laugh, fight and dance and sing
But our hearts have been so battered by the things that we have seen
And I can feel it in the way you look at me

[Chorus]
We could pick any old road and start again
Hell, we could change our names and try to forget
Lord knows I'll be sorry when it's done
But circumstances shot us down like September doves
Circumstances shot us down like September doves

[Verse 2]
My grandmother's lullabies used to sing me to sleep
I can't sleep nowadays without liquid relief
Well if lullabies were whiskey then my Grandma's drinks were cheap
I can't afford sleep anymore

And we were never made for love our souls are far too old
But loneliness needs company and a lost dog needs a home
So you will be the fire and I will be the coal
Baby we can burn out of control
You might also like[Chorus]
We could pick any old road and start again
Hell, we could change our names and try to forget
Lord knows I'll be sorry when it's done
But circumstances shot us down like September doves
Circumstances shot us down like September doves

[Chorus]
We could pick any old road and start again
Hell, we could change our names and try to forget
Lord knows I'll be sorry when it's done
But circumstances shot us down like September doves
Circumstances shot us down like September doves
