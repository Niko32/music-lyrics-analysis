John saw this city, oh, yes, he did
John caught a glimpse of the golden throne
Tell me all about it, go right on
Around the throne, he saw a crystal sea
There's got to be more, what will it be
I want to go to that city he saw
New Jerusalem

Jerusalem
I want to walk your streets that are golden
And I want to run where the angels have trod
Jerusalem
I want to rest on the banks of your river
In that city, city of God

John saw the lion lay down by the lamb
I want to know everything about that land
John saw the day, but he did not see night
The lamb of God, well, he must be the light
He saw the saints worship the Great I Am
Cryin', "Worthy, worthy is the Lamb"
I want to go to that city he saw
New Jerusalem

Jerusalem
I want to walk your streets that are golden
And I want to run where the angels have trod
Jerusalem
I want to rest on the banks of your river
In that city, city of God

Sing for the night is o'er
Hosanna in the highest
Hosanna forever
Forevermore

Jerusalem
I want to walk your streets that are golden
And I want to run where the angels have trod
Jerusalem
I want to rest on the banks of your river
In that city, city of God, city of God
Jerusalem, Jerusalem
City of God, city of God
