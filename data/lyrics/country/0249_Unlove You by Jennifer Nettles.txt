I could break down and cry
Laugh it off and deny
Draw lines in the sand
And count on both hands
All the reasons why
This just won't work
It'll be nothing but hurt
I can swear that I don't
And maybe one day I won't
But for how hard I've tried

[Chorus]
I can't unlove you
And a heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
To feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now

[Verse 2]
If I were 25
I know just what I'd do
I would have already kissed
Till I was drunk on your lips
A thousand times too few
But we have other lives
And we know it ain't right
This is going nowhere
If I'm with you I don't care
Take me nowhere tonight
You might also like[Bridge]
They call it fire
But it feels just like drowning
With the weight of my burning desire
Closing in all around me
I wasn't lost until you found me

[Chorus]
And I can't unlove you
And a heart can't unbreak
I can't unfeel how it felt
To feel so much myself
My whole body ached
And I can't unknow this
Lord, I wish I knew how
But I can't unlove you
So come love me for now

[Outro]
I can't unlove you
So come love me for now
