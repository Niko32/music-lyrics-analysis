Climb on up into Mama's bed, it's just us tonight
Don't need a book, just snuggle in
I'll tell you a story I wish I didn't have to say
About a girl who fought with all her heart
But still had to walk away

[Chorus]
Once upon a time he loved me
Once upon a time I loved him too
It all fell apart in a moment
Lord, I wish it wasn't true
'Cause you deserve the perfect family
The fairytales you know so well
Instead of sitting here listening
To the story I wish I didn't have to tell

[Verse 2]
I know it's hard to see Mama cry
But I promise you that we're all gonna be alright
I need you to know that you'll always be loved
You're the vеry best chapter in the story of us
And it goеs

[Chorus]
Once upon a time he loved me
Once upon a time I loved him too
It all fell apart in a moment
Lord, I wish it wasn't true
'Cause you deserve the perfect family
The fairytales you know so well
Instead of sitting here listening
To the story I wish I didn't have to tell
You might also like[Bridge]
Now it's time to pick up all these broken pieces
So that we can be the story we believe in

[Chorus]
Once upon a time it was us three
Starting over, all brand new
Dreaming of the happy ending I always wanted for you
'Cause you deserve the perfect family
The fairytales you know so well
Instead of sitting here listening
To the story I wish I didn't have to tell

[Outro]
The story I wish I didn't have to tell
