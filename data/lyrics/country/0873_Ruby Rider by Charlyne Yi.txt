This ol’ Ruby Rider is Ruby ridin' alone
She’s a sturdy solitary stone
This ol’ Ruby Rider, not a fusion no more
Now the dirt and the dust and the danger is my new home!

[Bridge]
I used to think I would always be by your side
But lately you’ve been rather cold
One look in your eye could make an honest gem cry
But Ruby Rider don’t need no one to hold

[Whistling]

[Verse 2]
This ol’ Ruby Rider is Ruby ridin' alone
She’s a sturdy solitary stone
