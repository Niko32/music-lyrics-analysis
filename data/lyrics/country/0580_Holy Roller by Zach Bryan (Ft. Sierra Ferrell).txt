I ain't never been a holy roller
But I found God in your eyes
The greens and browns remind me of a mountainside
All the days it all had come
And all the bad things that I've done
I ain't ever been a holy roller
But I found God in your eyes

[Verse 2: Zach Bryan & Sierra Ferrell]
We can stop for gas on our last trip out of town
All these songs about nothing
And straight-faced bluffin's got me down
'Cause old dogs bark way too loud
And talk shit on the weekend crowd
I ain't ever been a holy roller
But I found God in your eyes

[Chorus: Zach Bryan & Sierra Ferrell]
Comin' down and comin' up
There's a place for good love on the river's edge, darlin'
And I know home's not far from here
From sundown to sun up
There's a place for good rest in my warm arms, honey
And I found God in your eyes, dear
You might also like[Verse 3; Zach Bryan & Sierra Ferrell]
And you're grinnin' like a vandal
After swiggin' on a handle of Tito's
Lord, I didn't plan this
I'm just goin' as far as the wind blows
Coastlines to the flatlands
Get your rich hands out of our plans
I ain't ever been a holy roller
But I found God in your eyes

[Chorus: Zach Bryan & Sierra Ferrell]
Comin' down and comin' up
There's a place for good rest on the river's edge, darlin'
And I know home's not far from here
From sundown to sun up
There's a place for good love in my warm arms, honey
And I found God in your eyes, dear

[Outro: Zach Bryan & Sierra Ferrell]
I ain't never been a holy roller
But I found God in your eyes
The greens and browns remind me
Of a mountainside
All the days that are to come
And all the bad shit that I've done
I ain't ever been a holy roller
But I found God in your eyes
