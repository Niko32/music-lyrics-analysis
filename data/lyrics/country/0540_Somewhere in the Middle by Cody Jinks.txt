Couldn't have ever dawned on me
All the things that I would be, I
I never really looked out quite that far
It's never been a simple thing
To see the world with a young man's brain with
An old man's heart and restless soul

[Verse 2]
Yeah, my family went broke in my eighteenth year
Dad took a job many miles from here, that
That was alright by me, I was on my own
I had a band, found a job, and life was alright
I worked when I had to, we played all the time
Only got through that first year of college, alright

[Chorus]
But I learned more on the freight docks
Drivin' forklifts on the three o'clock AM shift
In the winter time, man, it got cold
Sellin' guitars on the west coast
Goin' hungry, chasin' ghosts around
And around we would go
And I saw it all tendin' bar at night
Treatin' saints and sinners right
Is a good thing to do all the time
You never know who you're talkin' to
But always know who's watchin' you
Keep your feet movin' straight down the line

I've known a lot of real good men
Grad school or no school, I've called em' my friends, I'm
I'm somewhere in the middle and that's just fine
No, I don't give a damn how much money you make
If your last shirt has pockets, take all you can take, I'm
Well, I'm goin' out with nothin' like I came in

[Chorus]
'Cause I learned more on the freight docks
Drivin' forklifts on the three o'clock AM shift
In the winter time, man, it got cold
Sellin' guitars on the west coast
Goin' hungry, chasin' ghosts around
And around we would go
And I saw it all tendin' bar at night
Treatin' saints and sinners right
Is a good thing to do all the time
You never know who you're talkin' to
But always know who's watchin' you
Keep your feet movin' straight down the line

[Chorus]
But I learned more on the freight docks
Drivin' forklifts on the three o'clock AM shift
In the winter time, man, it got cold
Sellin' guitars on the west coast
Goin' hungry, chasin' ghosts around
And around we would go
And I saw it all tendin' bar at night
Treatin' saints and sinners right
Is a good thing to do all the time
You never know who you're talkin' to
But always know who's watchin' you
Keep your feet movin' straight down the line
[Outro]
Yeah, and somewhere in the middle's just fine
Yeah, somewhere in the middle's just fine
