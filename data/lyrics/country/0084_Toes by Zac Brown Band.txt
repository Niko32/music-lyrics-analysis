I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today
Life is good today

[Verse 1]
Well, the plane touched down just about three o'clock
And the city's still on my mind
Bikinis and palm trees danced in my head
I was still in the baggage line
Concrete and cars are their own prison bars
Like this life I'm living in
But the plane brought me farther, I'm surrounded by water
And I'm not going back again

[Pre-Chorus]
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today
Life is good today

[Chorus 1]
Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
And if it weren't for tequila and pretty señoritas
I'd have no reason to stay
Adios and vaya con Dios
Yeah, I'm leaving GA
Gonna lay in the hot sun and roll a big fat one
And grab my guitar and play
You might also like[Verse 2]
The four days flew by like a drunk Friday night
As the summer drew to an end
They can't believe that I just couldn't leave
And I bid adieu to my friends
'Cause my bartender, she's from the islands
Her body's been kissed by the sun
And coconut replaces the smell of the bar
And I don't know if it's her or the rum

[Pre-Chorus]
I got my toes in the water, ass in the sand
Not a worry in the world, a cold beer in my hand
Life is good today
Life is good today

[Chorus 2]
Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Yes, and all the muchachas, they call me big papa
When I throw pesos their way
Adios and vaya con Dios
A long way from GA
Someone do me a favor and pour me some Jaeger and
I'll grab my guitar and play
[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus 3]
Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay
The señoritas don't care-o when there's no dinero, yeah
I got no money to stay
Adios and vaya con Dios
Going home now to stay

[Outro]
I'm just gon' drive up by the lake
And put my ass in a lawn chair, toes in the clay
Not a worry in the world, a PBR on the way
Life is good today
Life is good today
