It's been forever my dear, but I can't stop here
'Cause I know where it's goin'
I'm on the road missin' home, missin' the road while I'm home
But baby I'm goin'

[Verse 2]
With my heart on my sleeve, long nights and no sleep
Rain sunshine and snowin'
I'm on the road missin' home, missin' the road while I'm home
But baby I'm goin'

[Chorus]
I can't breathe, baby, I'm dyin'
Why are you cryin', while I'm tryin' for this love?
I can't believe you think I'm lyin'
What are you not buyin'? Is what I'm tryin' not enough?

[Verse 3]
This town's holdin' time
But what you believe keeps you rollin'
I'm on the road missin' home, missin' the road while I'm home
But this is my callin'

[Verse 4]
There's no right lines
Just lies that keep this old train rollin'
I'm on the road missin' home, missin' the road while I'm home
But baby I'm goin'
You might also like[Chorus]
I can't breathe, baby, I'm dyin'
Why are you cryin', while I'm tryin' for this love?
I can't believe you think I'm lyin'
What are you not buyin'? Is what I'm tryin' not enough?

[Bridge]
Now this star-painted sky keeps on fallin'
I wish you were me, so you could hear me when I'm callin'
When I'm callin'
When I'm callin'
When I'm callin'

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I can't breathe, baby, I'm dyin'
Why are you cryin', while I'm fightin' for this love?
I can't believe you think I'm lyin'
What are you not buyin'? Is what I'm tryin' not enough?

[Outro]
I can't breathe
I can't breathe
