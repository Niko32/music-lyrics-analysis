Road dogs are built for sleepin' in
I've been up since 4 AM
At your worst, you're better than my better days
There ain't been no sun in L.A.â€‹
Since you moved out of Sarah's place

[Verse 2: Noah Kahan]
I love your mother's stories 'bout you as a kid
I heard you scored a job in the East Village
Well, workin' for some folks who don't know your name
Well, ain't you gonna miss all of them wasted days?
We'd sit around, drinkin' out at Sarah's place

[Chorus: Zach Bryan & Noah Kahan]
Don't come back, lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face
Out at Sarah's place

[Verse 3: Zach Bryan & Noah Kahan, Zach Bryan]
And you called to talk just last week
I'm still fallin' apart like I'll always be
And your picnic chair is just sittin' there in the yard
And I had to sell my old guitar
You might also like[Chorus: Zach Bryan & Noah Kahan]
Don't come back, lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face
Out at Sarah's place

[Bridge: Noah Kahan]
You'll always be a piece of mine, a piece of mine
We drove that road we know at least a million times
I'm so damn tired of seein' that empty drive
Out at Sarah's place

[Chorus: Zach Bryan & Noah Kahan]
Don't come back, lover, I'm proud you're under the skyline
We always knew you were the better half of our good times
Those backyard lights don't shine as bright without your face
Out at Sarah's place

[Post-Chorus: Noah Kahan, Zach Bryan]
Oh, hey
Mm, mm

[Outro: Zach Bryan & Noah Kahan]
Plane tickets have gotten awfully expensive
But I got mine for the price of a Gibson
