Please come fast
Lazarus is sick
And without your help
He will not last
Mary and Martha
Watched their brother die
They waited for Jesus
He did not come
And they wondered why

The death watch was over
Buried four days
Somebody said, "He'll soon be here
The Lord's on his way"
Martha ran to him
And then she cried
"Lord, if you had been here
You could have healed him
He'd still been alive"

But You're four days late
And all hope is gone
Lord, we don't understand
Why You've waited so long
But His way is God's way
Not yours or mine
And isn't it great
When He's four days late
He's till on time
You might also likeJesus said, "Martha
Show me the grave"
But she said, "Lord
You don't understand
He's been there four days"
The gravestone was rolled back
Then Jesus cried
Lazarus come forth
Then somebody said
"He's alive, he's alive!"
(He's alive, he's alive)

You may be fighting
A battle of fear
You've cry to the Lord
"I need You now"
But he has not appeared
Friend, don't be discouraged
'Cause he's still the same
He'll soon be here
He'll roll back the stone
And He'll call out your name

When he's four days late
And all hope is gone
Lord, we don't understand
Why You've waited so long
But His way is God's way
Not yours or mine
And isn't it great
When He's four days late
He's still on time
(He's still on time)
Oh my God is great
When he's four days late
He's still on time
(He's still on time, on time)
