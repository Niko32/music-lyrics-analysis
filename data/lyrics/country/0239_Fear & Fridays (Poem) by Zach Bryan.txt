I'd say I've seen some beautiful days, I've walked countless coastlines, awoken on mountain tops, I have seen death and birth and kissed good lips
I don't need a music machine telling me what a good story is, and matter of fact I've never asked nothing from nobody
I've taken my motorbike down the Pacific 101 and I have stood atop the Empire State Building with my father
I've ridden in fear, although, I was afraid every single time
I've learned that every waking moment is enough and еxcess never lеads to better things, it only piles and piles atop the things that are already abundantly in front of you like breathing and chasing and slow dancing and love making, fighting and laughing
I am unhinged, unworthy, and distasteful to mostly everyone I meet, however I am loyal to a fault to anyone I find kindness in I do not and will not fear tomorrow because I feel as though today has been enough
And I got no hate in my heart for anything, anywhere, or anyone
And I think fear and Fridays got an awful lot in common, they're overdone and glorified and always leave you wantin'
