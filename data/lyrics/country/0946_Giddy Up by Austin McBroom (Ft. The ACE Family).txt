For one night only,  lets get out of the city
Go somewhere nobody knows
Leave them fancy clothes behind
You could be my cowgirl, take me for a ride
(Don't forget to hold on tight)

[Chorus]
Giddy giddy up we're slowing down yeah
I can't get enough riddin' riddin' round and round
Saddle up saddle up, it's going down oh
I can't get enough giddy up giddy up now
Giddy up giddy up now, oh
Oh giddy up giddy up

[Verse]
Love the life that we live
Love the one that I’m with
There’s nothing I would change
What I wouldn’t give for
Little get away, so why don’t we escape
Trace the city like stars here in L.A
We don’t call it rodeo, we call it rodeao
Paparazzi everywhere, we don’t get to lay low
Might not be the country type, but I’m down to try it
I ain’t gonna lie, I think we’re gonna like it
You might also like[Bridge]
For one night only,  lets get out of the city
Go somewhere nobody knows
Leave them fancy clothes behind
You could be my cowgirl, take me for a ride
(Don't forget to hold on tight)

[Chorus]
Giddy giddy up we're slowing down yeah
I can't get enough riddin' riddin' round and round
Saddle up saddle up, it's going down oh
I can't get enough giddy up giddy up now
(Repeat 1x)

[Outro]
Giddy up giddy up now, oh
Oh giddy up giddy up
Giddy up giddy up now, oh
Oh giddy up giddy up
