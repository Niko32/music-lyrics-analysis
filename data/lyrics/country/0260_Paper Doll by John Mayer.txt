Paper doll, come try it on
Step out of that black chiffon
Here's a dress of gold and blue
Sure was fun being good to you

[Verse 2]
This one we made just for fall
And winter runs a bit too small
This mint green is new for Spring
My love didn't cost a thing

[Chorus]
You're like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what theyâ€™re running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll

[Verse 3]
Fold a scarf, Moroccan red
Tie your hair behind your head
Strap into some heels that hurt
You shoulda kept my undershirt

[Chorus]
You're like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they're running from
Was it just too far to fall
For a little paper doll
You might also like[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 4]
Cut the cord and pull some strings
Make yourself some angel wings
And if those angel wings don't fly
Someone's going to paint you another sky

[Chorus]
'Cause you're like twenty-two girls in one
And none of them know what they're running from
Was it just too far to fall?
Was it just too far to fall?
