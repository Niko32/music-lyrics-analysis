Watching TV tired, bleeding on the bed
The milk has just expired, all the leaves are dead
I'm not quiet, you've been quiet, just receiving what you said
Reeling, feeding, feeling filled by everything you fed
I see you as you see yourself through all the books you read
Overwhelmed with guilt and realizing the disease

[Chorus]
You give me chills, I've had it with the drills
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing with the pills
I am empty 'til she fills, alive until she kills
In her vampire empire, I am

[Post-Chorus]
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah

[Verse 2]
I see you there rejecting all your earthly power
Protecting and dissecting 'til you've emptied every hour
We jump into the pond, then we come under the shower
You lay upon my pillow and you open like a flower
I wanted to see you naked, I wanted to hear you scream
Wanted to kiss your skin and your everything
I wanted to be your woman, I wanted to be your man
I wanted to be the one that you could understand
You might also like[Chorus]
You give me chills, I've had it with the drills
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing with the pills
I am empty 'til she fills, alive until she kills
In her vampire empire, I am

[Post-Chorus]
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah

[Bridge]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh

[Verse 3]
Well, I walked into your dagger for the last time
It's like trying to start a fire with matches in the snow
Where you can't seem to hold me, can't seem to let me go
So I can't find surrender, and I can't keep control
You turn me inside out and then you want the outside in
You spin me all around, then you ask me not to spin
You say you want to be alone, and you want children
You wanna be with me, you wanna be with him
[Chorus]
You give me chills, I've had it with the drills
I am nothing, you are nothing, we are nothing with the pills
I am empty 'til she fills, alive until she kills
In her vampire empire, I am

[Post-Chorus]
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
Falling, yeah
