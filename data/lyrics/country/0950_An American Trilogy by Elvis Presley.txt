Oh, I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland
Oh, I wish I was in Dixie, away, away
In Dixieland I take my stand to live and die in Dixie
For Dixieland, that's where I was born
Early Lord one frosty morning
Look away, look away, look away Dixieland

Glory, glory hallelujah

Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on

[Verse 3 - All My Trials]
So hush little baby
Don't you cry
You know your daddy's bound to die
But all my trials, Lord, will soon be over

[Outro - The Battle Hymn of the Republic (Reprise)]
