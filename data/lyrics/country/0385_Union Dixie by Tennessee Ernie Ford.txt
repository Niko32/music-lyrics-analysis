Right away! Come away! Right away! Right away, come away!
Where cotton's king and men are chattels
Union boys will win the battles
Right away! Come away! Right away, come away!

We'll all go down to Dixie, away, away!
Each Dixie boy must understand that he must mind his Uncle Sam
Away! Away! We'll all go down to Dixie!
Away! Away! We'll all go down to Dixie!
I wish I was in Baltimore, I'd make secession traitors roar
Right away! Come away! Right away! Come away! Right away, come away!
We'll put the traitors all to route, I'll bet my boots we'll whip 'em out
Right away! Come away! Right away, come away!

We'll all go down to Dixie, away, away!
Each Dixie boy must understand that he must mind his Uncle Sam
Away! Away! We'll all go down to Dixie!
Away! Away! We'll all go down to Dixie!

Oh may our Stars and Stripes still wave forever roar the free and brave!
Right away! Come away! Right away, come away! Come away!
And let our motto forever be for Union and for Liberty
Right away! Come away! Right away, come away!
