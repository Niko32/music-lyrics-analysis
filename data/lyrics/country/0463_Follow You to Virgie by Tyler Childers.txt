Back before these calloused hands and all this work
We used to sit up at the flats
Actin' like we'd live forever
Gettin' high and skippin' class
Yeah, I reckon we were heathens
But in her eyes we were saints
Now you're callin' all the boys home
'Cause heaven's angels carried her away

[Chorus]
So I will follow you to Virgie
Although it hurts me so
To lay to rest this mountain beauty
That the Lord's called home
And I can see her up in glory
I can see her through the pines

[Verse 2]
Back when all us boys were tryin'
To make sense of all these strings
I can see her in the corner
Just singin' along to all our crazy dreams

[Chorus]
So I will follow you to Virgie
Although it hurts me so
To lay to rest this mountain beauty
That the Lord's called home
And I can see her up in glory
I can see her through the pines
You might also like[Verse 3]
And I will follow you to Virgie
'Cause that's what us boys are for
To help you out when you get weary
And you can't go no more
And can't you see her up there, Cody?
I can see her through the pines
Sayin' "Boys be good"
