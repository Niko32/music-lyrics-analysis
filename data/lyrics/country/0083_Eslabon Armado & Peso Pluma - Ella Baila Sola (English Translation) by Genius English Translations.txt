Mate, what do you think of that girl?
The one dancing alone, I like her for myself
Beautiful, she knows she's hot
Everyone's watching her dance
I approach her and lay on the charm
We drink without reservations, just temptation
I told her, "I'm going to win over your family, and in a few days you'll be mine"
She said I'm crazy, but she likes that
No guy acts like me

[Interlude: Pedro Tovar & Peso Pluma]
Here you go, sweetheart
And all double P, man
Just like that, my buddy Pedro
All Eslabon Armado
For the young ladies
Cha-chau!

[Verse 2: Peso Pluma & Pedro Tovar]
I'm not a guy with money
But when it comes to the heart, I fulfill everything for you
I held her hand tightly
My friend couldn't believe it, as I passed by
Her body, I swear to God, was so perfect
Her waist like a model's
Her eyes captivated me from the start
She liked me, and I like herYou might also like
