East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
We gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm east bound, just watch ol' Bandit run

[Verse 1]
Keep your foot hard on the pedal
Son, never mind them brakes
Let it all hang out 'cause we've got a run to make
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta
And there's beer in Texarkana
And we'll bring it back no matter what it takes

[Chorus]
East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
We gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm east bound, just watch ol' Bandit run

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
We gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm east bound, just watch ol' Bandit run

Old Smokey's got them ears on
He's hot on your trail
And he ain't gonna rest 'til you're in jail
So you got to dodge him, you got to duck him
You've gotta keep that diesel truckin'
Just put that hammer down and give it hell

[Chorus]
East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
We gonna do what they say can't be done
We've got a long way to go and a short time to get there
I'm east bound, just watch ol' Bandit run
