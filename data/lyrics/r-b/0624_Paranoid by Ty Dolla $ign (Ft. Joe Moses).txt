Ohh, ohh
Dolla $ign
JM, hah!
Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Joe Moses]
I see two of my bitches in the club (What?)
And I know they know about each other (You a fool, nigga, hah!)
I think these bitches tryna set me up (Get out this motherfucker)
Maybe I’m just paranoid (Paranoid, yeah, uh)

[Verse 1: Ty Dolla $ign & Joe Moses]
I got a bad light skin from the Valley
She be in the club with no panties (Hah!)
Little bitch, she used to be my favorite (Yeah)
But now we don’t speak the same language
I love my bitch, I could bang it
But my dark skin bitch know how to take dick
I got 'em both the same damn red bottoms
And bought 'em both the same damn fragrance
Both of my bitches drive Range Rovers
None of my bitches can stay over
Both of my bitches look good as fuck (Yeah)
Your bitch look like a boogawolf (For real, nigga)

[Bridge: Ty Dolla $ign & Joe Moses]
Yeah, I’m paranoid, I’m trippin'

But I never made them hoes my missus

[Verse 2: Joe Moses]
I got a Spanish bitch, her name Mija (Hah!)
See all my bitches is bad, I’m not T.I. (What?)

The only thing I got is a long dick (Hah)
Two of my women conceited, like Mike, I beat it (Yeah)
No Bud, I Beat it, I get ‘em higher than Jesus
And when I pull out that penis, she like "woah!"
She got a truckful of ass, I gotta tow
See, all my niggas is ballin', we got dough
I got a car full of bitches, see, I’m a pro
See, it be two for me, I'ma pass the rest
Soon as they pass the test, I put dick on they breast (Yeah)
