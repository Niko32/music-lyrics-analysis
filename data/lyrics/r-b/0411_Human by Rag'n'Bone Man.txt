I'm only human
I'm only, I'm only
I'm only human, human

[Verse 1]
Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm blind
Thinking I can see through this and see what's behind
Got no way to prove it, so maybe I'm lying

[Refrain]
But I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

[Verse 2]
Take a look in the mirror and what do you see?
Do you see it clearer, or are you deceived
In what you believe?

[Refrain]
'Cause I'm only human after all
You're only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me

(Oh-oh) Some people got the real problems
(Oh-oh) Some people out of luck
(Oh-oh) Some people think I can solve them
(Oh-oh) Lord heavens above (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me (Oh-oh)
Don't put the blame on me (Oh-oh)

[Verse 3]
Don't ask my opinion, don't ask me to lie
Then beg for forgiveness for making you cry
Making you cry

[Refrain]
'Cause I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put your blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

[Chorus]
(Oh-oh) Oh, some people got the real problems
(Oh-oh) Some people out of luck
(Oh-oh) Some people think I can solve them
(Oh-oh) Lord heavens above (Oh-oh-oh)
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me (Oh-oh)
Don't put the blame on me (Oh-oh)
[Post-Chorus]
(Oh-oh-oh)
I'm only human, I make mistakes
I'm only human, that's all it takes
To put the blame on me (Oh-oh)
Don't put the blame on me (Oh-oh)

[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
'Cause I'm no prophet or Messiah
(Ooh-ooh-ooh)
You should go looking somewhere higher

[Refrain]
I'm only human after all
I'm only human after all
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put the blame on me

[Outro]
I'm only human, I do what I can
I'm just a man, I do what I can
Don't put the blame on me
Don't put your blame on me
