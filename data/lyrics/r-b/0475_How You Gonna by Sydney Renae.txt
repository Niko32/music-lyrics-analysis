If I could go back to the day we met
I would probably do it all over again
And I would choose not to be your friend
When you ask me, I'd just say I got a man
It wouldn't be no dates
It would be no staying late, at my house
It would be no watching movies on my couch
Shit went left, and now I'm just trying to figure out
Said, "You'd always be my baby", then you bounced

[Chorus]
How you gonna up and leave like that when I gave you all I had?
I gave you the real me, told you all my feelings
And you gonna turn around and front like you don't feel me
I put that on my life that I ain't see this comin'
Opened up my heart, I should've never let you come in
But I wish you well though, that's all I could tell you
Maybe in your next life, you'll find everything you wanted

[Verse 2]
I never thought that lovin' you would cause me pain
I'll never put a man before myself again
You should've told me that you was uncertain
"This ain't what I wanted, this ain't workin'"
You was dead ass my baby, loved the shit out of you, crazy
Shit, it's crazy how you could just turn around and try to play me
Boy, I know that we been going through some things
But just keep it real is all I'm sayin'
You might also like[Bridge]
I was the one lovin' you, I was the one cuffin' you
Call me when you need me, I was the one comin' through
Why didn't you believe in us? How come you just couldn't love?
It wasn't that you didn't care, you just wasn't good enough

[Chorus]
How you gonna up and leave like that when I gave you all I had?
I gave you the real me, told you all my feelings
And you gonna turn around and front like you don't feel me
I put that on my life that I ain't see this comin'
Opened up my heart, I should've never let you come in
But I wish you well though, that's all I could tell you
Maybe in your next life, you'll find everything you wanted
