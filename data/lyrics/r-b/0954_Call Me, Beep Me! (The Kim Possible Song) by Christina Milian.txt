Ooh, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
I'm your basic average girl
And I'm here to save the world
You can't stop me 'cause I'm Kim Possible
There is nothing I can't do
And when danger calls
Just know that I am on my way
(Know that I am on my way)

[Pre-Chorus]
It doesn't matter where or when there's trouble
If you just call my name, Kim Possible

[Chorus]
Call me, beep me if you wanna reach me
When you wanna page me, it's okay
I just can't wait until
I hear my cell phone ring
Doesn't matter if it's day or night
Everything is gonna be alright
Whenever you need me, baby
Call me, beep me if you wanna reach me

I will help you find your way
(Help is right away)
