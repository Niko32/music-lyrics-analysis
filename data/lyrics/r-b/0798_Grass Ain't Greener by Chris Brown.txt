(Oh, yeah)
(Oh, yeah)

[Verse 1]
You ain't the girl that you used to be
You say you're done, you're movin' on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leavin' messages on your cell
A true lover, but when I'm not there
Girl, you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waitin' for my love to break up (Oh-woah)
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Actin' like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side (It, it ain't green)
Oh, yeah  (It ain't green)

[Verse 2]
Seems like ain't nothin' cool about bein' real (No)
No one's honest about what they feel
Take a ho and try to treat her well
She'll be back up at the club again (I, huh)
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
'Less I know for sure that you're vibin' with me
You do what you want with somebody else
I'm gone, baby
You might also like[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waitin' for my love to break up (Oh-woah)
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Actin' like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
I been there, oh, yeah, I been there
That grass ain't greener on the other side (I, it, it ain't green)
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah, it ain't green)

[Verse 3]
My homie said I need to stop it
My momma said, "Bitches be watchin' you
They gon' put their hand all in your pocket
For the credit card that's in your wallet"
Drinkin' liquor when we celebratin'
Calculatin' all my funds
Tryna get a nigga take the condom off
'Cause she want that tax every month (Woo)
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
Take my kindness for weakness when you act sadity
Keepin' it one hunnid ain't your fort√©
You used to be

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waitin' for my love to break up (Oh-woah)
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Actin' like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah (Oh, yeah)
That grass ain't greener on the other side (Yeah-yeah, it, it ain't green)
Oh, yeah, other side (it ain't green)
