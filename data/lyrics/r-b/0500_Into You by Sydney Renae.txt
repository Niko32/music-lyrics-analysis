I can't explain it, I'm into you
And every little thing you do
Never felt the way about no dude
Believe it when I say that I'm feelin' you
It's so hard to find someone who's true and kind
Kind in every way like, to my body, soul and mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it true (That I'm all you need)?
Is it true (That you are the one for me)?
Is it true (When you are with her that I am on your memory)?
Is it true (You be missin' me)?
Is it true? (The way you be kissin' me)
I turn your world around and upside down
You got me now

[Chorus]
I really like what you've done to me
I have no clue what it is you do
But all I know is I be lovin' you
I really like what you've done to me
I have no clue what it is you do
But all I know is I be lovin' you

[Verse 2]
Everybody's like, "Girl, don't trip"
"You the only one he been with"
"He don't even really commit like that"
"I ain't never seen him with no other chick like that"
So tell me how you feel
'Cause I can't read yo mind
Wanna know what you been thinkin'
And what you feel inside
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Is it true (That I'm all you need)?
Is it true (That you are the one for me)?
Is it true? 'Cause I've been imagining the beauty you in life could bring
Is it true? (I wanna know)
Is it true? (Are you serious?)
Do you feel the way I do?
Are you into me like I'm into you?

[Chorus]
I really like what you've done to me
I have no clue what it is you do
But all I know is I be lovin' you
I really like what you've done to me
I have no clue what it is you do
But all I know is I be lovin' you
I really like what you've done to me
I have no clue what it is you do
But all I know is I be lovin' you
I really like what you've done to me
I have no clue what it is you do
But all I know is I be lovin' you
