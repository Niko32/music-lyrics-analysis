I’ve got a God-shaped hole that’s infected
And I’m petrified of being alone now
It's pathetic, I know

[Pre-Chorus]
And I tossed and I turn in my bed
It's just like I lost my head (Lost my head)

[Chorus]
And if I believe You
Will that make it stop?
If I told You I need You
Is that what You want?
And I'm broken and bleeding
And begging for help
(There's no use singing a song)
And I'm asking You Jesus, show Yourself

[Verse 2]
I thought I’d met You once or twice
But that was just because the dabs were nice and opening up my mind
Showing me consciousness is primary in the universe
And I had a revelation
I'll be Your child if You insist
I mean if it was You that made my body
You probably shouldn't have made me atheist
But, oh, I’m a lesbian kiss
I'm an evangelist
And if you don't want to go to hell then Miss, you better start selling this
You might also like[Chorus]
And if I believe You
Will that make it stop?
If I told You I need You
Is that what You want?
And I'm broken and bleeding
And begging for help
(There's no use singing a song)
And I'm asking You Jesus, show Yourself

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
Then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
Yeah, yeah
