See my face when I slide through
Every place I will find you
Every time we fell apart
Girl I see it in the scars
Baby hold my hand, let me be your man
Let me take you away from the cold
Baby be my diamonds and gold
Wander through the dead with you caught up in my head
Thinkin' I'ma flip and fill my brain with lead
I'ma end my life without you
Baby let's just see what these clouds do
I'm not so perfect baby yeah you worth it
Come right here, hey
Girl let me see you work it
Now we closin' curtains, come right here

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Don't you know you're so sexy
The way you move your body up and down
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are
But you're no where to be found, hey
I tried to protect you
From my hands you left
You broke my heart right there, all I do is stare
No you'll never fuckin care, hey
I thought you were different
Telling me what is and I was wrong
I never thought of you as ig'nant
Now I'm gettin' lifted, you're in my soul
Baby I'm about to die
Baby wanna watch me die
Baby don't you wanna know why
Didn't even try
