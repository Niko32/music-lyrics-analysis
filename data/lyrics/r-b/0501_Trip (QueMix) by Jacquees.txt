Ooh, ooh, yeah
Ooh, ooh, yeah

[Verse 1]
I gotta ride with my gun on safety
So I don't go shootin' where yo' nigga be
Girl you dodging bullets tryna play me (you know it)
Then I'm left to deal with how you made me

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a whole lot of love, ain't tryna waste it
You got me runnin' around and I never chase it (yeah)
Your face so pretty to me, makeup ain't make it (nah)
Your face so pretty to me, makeup can't make it

[Chorus]
But I think that I'm done trippin', I'm trip-trippin' (woah, woah, right)
I've been sippin', that's how I control (woah, right, right, woah)
This feelin', you keep givin' (woah, right, yeah)
And I keep on hittin' it, you know (woah)
I could be the perfect young nigga for ya (alright)
Baby girl, your love got me trippin' on you (alright)
You know my love is big enough, got you trippin' on me (what)
Yeah it's big enough got you trippin' on me
Trip, trippin' on me
My bad, it's your bad, for you trippin' on me (trippin' on me, yeah, what, right)
My bad, it's your bad, for you trippin' on me (trippin' on me)

Girl, it ain't cool how you be playin' (what, right, yeah)
And I don't dig how you keep me waitin' (talk to 'em, Jacquees)
Your feelins switch up too much, girl it's confusing
'Cause you tell me we're friends, then the next time I'm a friend with an end
I done put in work, fucked up, came back again (what, right)
I jumped in the booth, I don't need a pad or a pen to say how I feel
I can't keep bottlin' it in, I'm addicted to you
Your love, I gotta get

[Pre-Chorus]
Got a whole lot of love, ain't tryna waste it (woah)
You got me runnin' around and I never chase it (shit feel good)

Your face so pretty to me, makeup can't make it (right)

[Chorus]
But I think that I'm done trippin', I'm trip-trippin' (what)

Baby girl, your love got me trippin' on you (on you)
You know my love is big enough, got you trippin' on me (yeah, alright)
