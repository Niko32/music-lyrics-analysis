You in brown checked suit
Said my dress was very cute
I found you found me
Dancing in this melody
Heavenly!

[Chorus]
We were swinging on so nice
Bubbly pink champagne on ice
Nancy, Jacques Clouseau and Claire
I believe they all were there
Having the time of their lives

[Verse 2]
You had Rose's lime
Mixed with vodka, I had wine
People having fun
Cocktails in the evening sun
Give me one!

[Chorus]
We were swinging on so nice
Bubbly pink champagne on ice
Nancy, Jacques Clouseau and Claire
Well, I believe they all were there
Having the time of their lives
You might also likeWe were swinging on so nice
Bubbly pink champagne on ice
Nancy, Jacques Clouseau and Claire
I believe they all were there

[Outro]
La la la do be do be do
