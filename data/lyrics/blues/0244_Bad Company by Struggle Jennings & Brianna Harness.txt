I don't think you know how to be in love with me
Your words don't comfort me
Ooh, you should run from me
I'm bad company
I don't think you know how to be in love with me
Your words don't comfort me
Ooh, you should run from me
I'm bad company

[Verse 1: Struggle Jennings]
Tear drops on your eye lids
'Cause you worried about the life I live
Can't change my ways, I done tried before
Try to make you laugh but you cry more
At war with my own soul
On this road it's been so cold
But our love burns like a hot coal
I'm afraid the flame's gon' swallow you
Die for you, and I'd kill for you
But I don't think you know what I feel for you
To be real with you, I've got issues
You don't deserve to be put through
I could lie, say I'll put you first
But I never will, Outlaw's Curse
And you're worth more, but you'll hurt more
If you stick around, so whats worse?
Not the knight that you searched for
No white horse and no shiny armor
Come equipped with a broken heart
Bunch of crazy love and some bad karma
Know I'll never find a better love
And I don't think that I could ever measure up
Weigh my options on a broken scale
See the fast life will bring a slow hell

I don't think you know how to be in love with me
Your words don't comfort me
Ooh, you should run from me
I'm bad company
I don't think you know how to be in love with me
Your words don't comfort me
Ooh, you should run from me
I'm bad company

[Verse 2: Brianna Harness]
I know your life and I've signed up
Be by your side when times get tough
If you run away, I'll chase you
Our happiness is so near
We're growin' love with no fear
I'll never turn my back, to face you

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus: Struggle Jennings & Brianna Harness]
I don't think you know how to be in love with me
Your words don't comfort me
Ooh, you should run from me
I'm bad company
I don't think you know how to be in love with me
Your words don't comfort me
Ooh, you should run from me
I'm bad company
