Cassy's got a new plan
Gotta get herself away
Well, I'd better act quick
Yeah, I'd better ch-ch-change my ways

Oh, maybe I'm wasting
Maybe I'm chasing time
Oh, come on, let's face it
I'm only ever lost in mine

Well, I got my tracing paper
So that I could trace my clock
And the bastard face kept changing
And the hands, they wouldn't stop

I was ripping out the battery
I received myself a shock
And to add insult to injury
I could still hear tick & tock

[Chorus]
CASSY O'
CASSY O'
Please don't leave
CASSY O'
CASSY O'
Please don't leave

Cassy's got a new plan
Gotta give herself a break
And I try, I try, I try
For heaven's sake

Well, I traveled to Australia
And I traveled there by train
This something might sound strange to you
But on the way I gained a day

And I wrote to tell my family
And I wrote to tell my friends
I arrived home, it was lost again
And this torture never ends

[Chorus]
CASSY O'
CASSY O'
Please don't leave
CASSY O'
CASSY O'
Please

[Bridge]
Inspector, fix me, my Cassy O's burnt out
We're losing memories that I can't replace
She says she's tired of me running in circles
She says it's time that we took a break
[Chorus]
CASSY O'
CASSY O'
Please don't leave
CASSY O'
CASSY O'
Please don't leave
