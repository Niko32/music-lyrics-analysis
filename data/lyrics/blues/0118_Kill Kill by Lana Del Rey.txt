Bound up the stairs
I'm in the shower
Do you know I am going to leave you?
Do you know I am going to leave you?

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand, hmm
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can, hmm

[Verse 2]
Tell me about Ray and his girl
Do I know Ray has gone to meet you?
Love you, I do
Stay here, I won't
The stars fade from your eyes

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love, lying in the sand, hmm
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can, hmm

Don't trust anyone
One, two, make it fun
Don't trust anyone

[Chorus]
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can, hmm
I'm in love with a dying man
I'm in love with a dying man
I have done everything I can, hmm

[Outro]
One, two, make it fun
Don't trust anyone
One, two, make it fun
Make it fun, make it fun
