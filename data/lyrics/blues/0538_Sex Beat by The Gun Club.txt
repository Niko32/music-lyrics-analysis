Johnny's got a light in his eyes and
Shirley's got a light on her lips
Jake's got a monkeyshine on his head
And Debra Ann's got a tiger in her hips
They can twist and turn, they can move and burn
They can throw themselves against the wall
But they creep for what they need
And they explode to the call

[Chorus]
And then they move, move
Sex beat, go

[Verse 2]
They're stupid like I told ya, very stupid like ya saw
Very stupid as the simple thought of ever thinking at all
And all their mind, all their souls, all their bodies, all we know
All the things that should have made us whole
All the colourless security was all that someone could go

[Chorus]
And move, move
Sex beat, drop

[Verse 3]
And yes, you do look cool, and by the floodlights so blue
You make my tropical apartment's bed your sacrificial pool
My body in the water, and my heart is in your hand
So this is the way you choose to send me
To the judgement land
You might also like[Chorus]
So you can't move, move ooh
Sex beat, go

[Verse 4]
And every day I agree
You throw me down by the Christmas tree
I watched your lights blink on and off while you
Start your fun with me
I, I know your reasons, and I, I know your goals
We can fuck forever, but you will never get my soul

[Chorus]
Just so you can move
So you can move
So you can move
So you can move so you can
Ooh, sex beat
