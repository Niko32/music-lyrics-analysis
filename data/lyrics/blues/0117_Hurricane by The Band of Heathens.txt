Thirty miles on the Gulf Stream
I hear the south wind moan
The bridges getting lower
The shrimp boats coming home
The old man down in the Quarter
Slowly turns his head
Takes a sip from his whiskey bottle
And this is what he said

[Chorus]
I was born in the rain
On the Pontchartrain
Underneath the Louisiana moon
I don't mind the strain
Of a hurricane
They come around every June
The high black water
A devil's daughter
She's hard, she's cold, and she's mean
But nobody taught her
It takes a lot of water
To wash away New Orleans

[Verse 2]
Man came down from Chicago
He gonna set that levee right
He said, "It needs to be at least three feet higher
"It won't make it through the night"
But the old man down in the Quarter
He said "Don't you listen to that boy
"The water'll be down by the morning
"And he'll be back to Illinois"
You might also like[Chorus]
I was born in the rain
On the Pontchartrain
Underneath the Louisiana moon
I don't mind the strain
Of a hurricane
They come around every June
The high black water
A devil's daughter
She's hard, she's cold, and she's mean
But nobody taught her
It takes a lot of water
To wash away New Orleans

[Verse 1]
Thirty miles on the Gulf Stream
I hear the south wind moan
The bridges getting lower
The shrimp boats coming home
The old man down in the Quarter
Slowly turns his head
Takes a sip from his whiskey bottle
And this is what he said

[Chorus]
I was born in the rain
On the Pontchartrain
Underneath the Louisiana moon
I don't mind the strain
Of a hurricane
They come around every June
The high black water
A devil's daughter
She's hard, she's cold, and she's mean
But nobody taught her
It takes a lot of water
To wash away New Orleans
[Chorus]
I was born in the rain
On the Pontchartrain
Underneath the Louisiana moon
I don't mind the strain
Of a hurricane
They come around every June
The high black water
A devil's daughter
She's hard, she's cold, and she's mean
But nobody taught her
It takes a lot of water
To wash away New Orleans
Nobody taught her
It takes a lot of water
To wash away New Orleans, yeah
