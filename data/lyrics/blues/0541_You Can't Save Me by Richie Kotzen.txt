I broke my heart so I couldn't feel pain
I've lost my faith cause' I can't justify the weight
I've got no hope that's only for losers and fakes

Ref:

I'm nothing but a user and an abuser
You don't wanna know what's on my mind
I know i'm just a fool but i'm not fooling
Not afraid to make a fool out of my self
And fuck your money
Fuck your fame
Fuck my life I walk away
And fuck I love
Fuck i'm sorry for everything I ever done
You can't save me
You better give your self to someone else
Fading
I'm just fallin' into my condition
Fading
You better put your time in something else
Save me but don't worry about it now
You better save your fucking self

I lost my mind just so I could escape
I still got time but I know it's too late
I still got friends to tell me i'm ok
I still alive but I keep on testin' fate

Try just a little understand what i'm telling you
I'm not what you think
I started off doing the right thing
Life got in the way
You don't know what to say
I'm not asking why
You can't save me
You better give your self to someone else
Fading
Fallin' into my condition
Faded
You better put your time in something else
Save me but don't worry about it now
You better save your fucking self
