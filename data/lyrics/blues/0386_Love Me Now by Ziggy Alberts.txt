And I’m sick of arguing with you
Do you ever feel like you’re on a train
Moving too fast to stop
But someone you love is in the carriage
And you can’t get off


So baby could you love me now?
So baby could you love me now?
So baby could you love me now?
So could you love me now?
Could you love me now?
Enough to let this go


My voice is getting tired
And oh I’m sick of you always letting me down
Do you ever feel like
Just getting drunk
To deal with whats been going on
And your only drinking coffee
To get up off the floor


So baby could you love me now?
So baby could you love me now?
So baby could you love me now?
So could you love me now?
Could you love me now?
Enough to let this go
You might also like
I remember the last time
I know I made love
And how your back was pressed
Against the steering wheel
And I remember how I drove off
The things I wish we had discussed
Before I offered what I, what I have here


So baby could you love me now?
So baby could you love me now?
So baby could you love me now?
So baby could you love me now?
So baby could you love me now?
I said baby could you love me now?
Baby could you love me now?
Could you love me now?
Could you love me now?


Enough to let this go
Enough to let this go
Enough to let this go
Enough to let this go
