And the next day ain't nothing shaking
But it ain't nobody's business if we do
If me and my baby fuzz and fight
Yes and the next minute let me tell you were alright

I'm three three times seven
Lord, lord, lord let me tell you it makes twenty one
And it ain't nobody's business what I'll do
Lord, lord, lord,lord, lord, lord, lord
Lord, lord, lord,lord, lord, lord, lord
Ain't nobody's business what I'll do
I said lord, lord, lord,lord, lord, lord, lord
Mmm, lord, lord
And it ain't nobody's business what I'll doYou might also like
