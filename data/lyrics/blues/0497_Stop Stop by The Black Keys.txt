You're wound up like a weapon
You got an evil streak
They told me to stay away
But I was much too weak

[Chorus]
You gotta
Stop, stop can't you hear me call and singin'
Stop, stop it girl
Yeah, you gotta
Stop, stop can't you see me fall and singin'
Stop, stop it girl

[Verse 2]
I hounded you forever
But you never saw
This love was so strong it should'a
Been against the law

[Chorus]
Yeah, you gotta
Stop, stop can't you hear me call and singin'
Stop, stop it girl
Yeah, you gotta
Stop, stop can't you see me fall and singin'
Stop, stop it girl

You tear me all apart
Then act so warm
Like being cooled by the rain
In the eye of the storm

[Chorus]
And yeah, you gotta
Stop, stop can't you hear me call and singin'
Stop, stop it girl
Yeah, you gotta
Stop, stop can't you see me fall and singin'
Stop, stop it girl

[Chorus]
Yeah, you gotta
Stop, stop can't you hear me call and singin'
Stop, stop it girl
Yeah, you gotta
Stop, stop can't you see me fall and singin'
Stop, stop it girl
