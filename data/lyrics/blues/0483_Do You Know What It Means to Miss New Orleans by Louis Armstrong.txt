And miss it each night and day?
I know Iâ€™m not wrong, the feeling's getting stronger
The longer I stay away

Miss the moss-covered vines, the tall sugar pines
Where mockingbirds used to sing
And I'd like to see the lazy Mississippi
A-hurrying into spring

Oh the Mardi Gras, the memories
Of Creoles' tunes that filled the air
I dream of oleanders in June
And soon I'm wishing that I were there

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans
When that's where you left your heart?
And there's something more, I miss the one I care for
More than I miss New OrleansYou might also like
