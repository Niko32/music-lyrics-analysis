Hollowed onto your wrist
Heaven knows I don’t follow
But I believe in this

Blending into the darkness
And it gets harder to see
Try to stand and unravel
What a man's gotta be

CHORUS
When darlin' you're the only fit, you should know
Each time I break the final straw
It's loving you, blinds the senses
Reveals my inexperience
Oh, I can't even help myself
So how do I handle someone else?
It's loving you, takes me higher
The only thing that keeps the fire
Is loving you
Loving you
Loving...

Breaking through my composure
No she don’t stop for the walls
Between the wreck and the ruin
We rebuild it all
You might also likeAnd we endlessly falter
Its a faith to be true
On such a delicate tightrope
But It’s a risk we choose

CHORUS
When darlin' you're the only fit, you should know
Each time I break the final straw
It's loving you, blinds the senses
Reveals my inexperience
Oh, I can't even help myself
So how do I handle someone else?
It's loving you, takes me higher
The only thing that keeps the fire
Is loving you
Loving you
Lovin'...

Loving you
Loving you
Loving

Loving you
Loving you
Loving
...Loving Loving Loving
Loving you
Loving you
Loving
Loving

CHORUS
Darlin' you're the only fit, you should know
Each time I break the final straw
It's loving you, blinds the senses
Reveals my inexperience
Oh, I can't even help myself
So how do I handle someone else?
It's loving you, takes me higher
The only thing that keeps the fire
Is loving
Loving
Loving you
