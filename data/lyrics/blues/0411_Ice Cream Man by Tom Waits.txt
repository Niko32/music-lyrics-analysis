I'll be clicking by your house about 2:45
With sidewalk sundae, strawberry surprise
I got a cherry popsicle right on time
A big stick, momma, that'll blow your mind

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm your ice cream man
I'm a one-man band, yeah
I'm your ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you

[Verse 2]
If you missed me in the alley, baby, don't you fret
Come back around and don't forget
When you're tired and you're hungry and you want something cool
Got something better than a swimming pool

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm your ice cream man
I'm a one-man band
I'm your ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you, yeah

[Guitar Break]

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm your ice cream man
I'm a one-man band
I'm your ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you

You see me coming, you ain't got no change
Don't worry, baby, it can be arranged
Show me you can smile, baby, just for me
Fix you with a drumstick, I'll do it for free

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm an ice cream man
I'm a one-man band
I'm your ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you

[Outro]
Be good to you
Be good to you, yeah
Good to you, yeah
Good to you, yeah
Good to you, yeah
Good to you, yeah
Good to you, yeah
Good to you
I'll be good to you
I'll be good to you
Don't you know, I'm gonna be good, yeah
I'll be good, yeah
I'll be good, yeah
Good to you, yeah
