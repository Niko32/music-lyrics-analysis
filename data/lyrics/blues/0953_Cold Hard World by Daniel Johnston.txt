It's a cold hard world, It's a cold hard world
It's a cold hard world, oh no
I heard Red Donley say, It was on the news today
It's a cold hard world, It's a cold hard world

[Verse 1]
It's hiking across the country, looking for a bite to eat
You'd be surprised at the angles and the people you'd meet
Rolling down that highway with eyes fixed straight ahead
They have a caravan of cars to bury the dead
And coke cans and pop bottles lined the streets like flowers instead
And this guy gave me a ride, I said this industrial waste sure stinks
He said he likes that smell 'cause that's the smell of money
I said "well, mister money stinks, too."

[Refrain]
It's a cold hard world, It's a cold hard world
It's a cold hard world, oh no *flips page*

[Verse 2]
I met a fireman, he said you never forget burning flesh
And the librarian said do you have a card here?
I said I've been coming here for weeks, don't you recognize me by now?
I checked out a million books just to get you to notice me
You might also like[Refrain]
It's a cold hard world, It's a cold hard world
It's a cold hard world, oh no
Somebody's house burned down, somebody's hubcap fell off
Somebody's soul got lost, somebody's heart got broke
I heard Red Donley say, it was on the news today
It's a cold hard world, it's a cold hard world
