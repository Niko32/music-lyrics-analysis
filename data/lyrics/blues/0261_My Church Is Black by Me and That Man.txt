You're standing a long time on the shore
You try to chase away your thoughts
You want to feel the land you're looking for
You want to move, but you lost the gall
You want to pray, but you forgot the words
You lost the land you're looking for
But the first steps are in your heart
Some answers come from tears and from the dark
And all the signs are in the heart
Sometimes you must close your eyes
To see who you are

[Verse]
My church is black, my Christ is cold
My cross is pale, all hope is gone (My church is black)
My church is black, my Christ is cold
My cross is pale, hell is my home (Hell is my home)
(Ooh, my church is black)
My church is black, my blood runs cold
The sun don't shine for me no more (For me no more)
Black is the moon, cold is the sun
Sing hallelujah, no kingdom come (No kingdom come)
(Ooh, my church is black)
(Ooh, my church is black)

[Outro]
(Ooh, my church is black)
(Ooh, my church is black)
(Ooh, my church is black)
