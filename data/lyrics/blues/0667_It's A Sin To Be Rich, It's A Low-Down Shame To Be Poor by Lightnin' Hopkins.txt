You know a rich man ain't got a chance to go to heaven and a poor man got a hard way to go

You know I don't wanna be rich, I just wanna stay between rich and poor
No, I don't wanna be rich, I just wanna live between rich and poor
Yes, when I die you know I wanna go to heaven, that's when Po' Lightnin' will have a chance to go
