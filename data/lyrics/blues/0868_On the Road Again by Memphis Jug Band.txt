I would not -- black woman, tell you the reason why
(Why?)
Black woman's evil, do things on the sly
(No!)
You look for your supper to be good and hot
(Uh-huh!)
She'll never put a neck-bone in the pot

[Chorus]
She's on the road again, just as sure as you're born
Lord, a natural-born eastman on the road again
She's on the road again
Lord, a natural-born eastman on the road again

[Verse 2]
I went to my window. My window was propped
I went to my door. My door was locked
I stepped right back. I shook my head
A big black nigga in my folding bed
I shot through the window. I broke the glass
I never seen a little nigga run so fast

[Chorus]
He's on the road again
Lord, a natural-born eastman on the road again
He's on the road again
Lord, a natural-born eastman on the road again

Your friend come to your house, while passing, to rest his hat
(Yeah)
The next thing he want to know where's your husband at
She says, "I don't know. He's on his way to the pen
"Come on, mama, let's get on the road again

[Chorus]
He's on the road again
Lord, a natural-born eastman on the road again
He's on the road again
Lord, a natural-born eastman on the road again
Come on, mama, on the road again
