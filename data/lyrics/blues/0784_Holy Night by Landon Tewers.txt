Oh, holy night
The stars are so fucking blinding
I had a dream the dope in my bloodstream and aching to live weren't colliding
And that's just the way it is
And oh, I'm trying
(For you, for you, for you)
For you, you, you, you

[Chorus]
I know there's something
I know there's something good
I know there's something
I know there's something good

[Verse 2]
I used to dread coming home, dread starting over
This whole fucking family, my friends start to fail me over and over
Everyone I looked up to seems to keep falling shorter
Wish I could take all of your demons and suffer alone in the corner

[Chorus]
I know there's something
I know there's something good
I know there's something
I know there's something good, in me
You might also like[Verse 3]
Hide all your empathy, show me reality, make me face myself
I embrace all the tragedy, break while it's happening
But tell them all, I'm well

[Bridge]
Oh, holy night
It's become something I just despise
And my hands have done so much wrong
I'm afraid it's not me who decides
(Keep your heart safe from me)
(Keep your heart safe from me)

[Chorus]
I know there's something
I know there's something good
(I know there's something good)
(I know there's something good)
I know there's something
I know there's something good
(I know there's something good)
(I know there's something good)
(Keep your heart safe from me)
Hide all your empathy, show me reality, make me face myself
(I know there's something good)
(I know there's something good)
I embrace all the tragedy, break while it's happening but tell them all I'm well
(I know there's something good)
(I know there's something good)
[Outro]
"I'm assuming you're passed out drunk right now, but I miss you, call me when you wake up, okay? I love you."
