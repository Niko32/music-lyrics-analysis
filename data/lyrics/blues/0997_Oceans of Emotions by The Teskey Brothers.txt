When I first met you, baby, everything I knew
Wasn't any brighter than a shade of blue
Your blue eyes and brown hair, how could I resist?
But the colour of your stare, it doesn't compare

[Pre-Chorus]
Times were better when I was still there
I was better when I was still there

[Chorus]
Now we're swimming through
Oceans of emotions, seven days at a time
Oh, the water's blue and so are you
I won't be running out any time soon

[Verse 2]
I go up and I come down
When I remember the day, I was still around
Yeah, the water was just right, like your lips so warm
But now my heart is torn between the rose and the thorn

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, times were better when I was still there
I was better when I was still there
You might also like[Chorus]
Now we're swimming through
The oceans of emotions, seven days at a time
The water's blue and so are you
I won't be running out any time soon

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Now we're swimming through
Oceans of emotions, seven days at a time
The water's blue and so are you
I won't be running out any time soon
I won't be running out any time soon
I won't be running out any time soon
