It's cloudy in the west, it looks like rain
My eyes are black holes and I'm burning away
You slaughtered your loving man
Killed him in his sleep
And the blood and crying of your murder
Simply stains your sheets

[Chorus]
You're a ghost on the highway
Your gesture is meaningless
You're lost to the living men
Trailing souls to the end

[Verse 2]
You thought winning as a woman meant failing as a friend
It is not an art statement to drown a few passionate men
You made yourself a diamond
To blind young men's eyes
You claim because they want your shine
They deserve to walk the line

[Chorus]
You're a ghost on the highway
Your gesture is meaningless
You're lost forever to the living men
Trailing souls to the end, oh
You might also like[Verse 3]
Oh, but yes, I would give you my love
So my soul would not starve
But, it could never move the honest rock
Of what you really are

[Chorus]
A ghost on the highway
You're like straw and meaningless
And I hate you, but I love you
And I'll carry that to the end

[Verse 4]
If I ever lie with you again, I pray I do not sleep
And If I ever closed my eyes again, I'd realize what you are to me
You are simply a liar
An animal who bluffs and steals
Until you become
A bigger creature's meal

[Chorus]
You're a ghost on the highway
You're trash and meaningless
I hate you, but I love you
And I'll carry that to the end
[Outro]
Like a ghost on the highway
Like a ghost on the highway
Oh, lost on the highway
You're lost on the highway
Oh
