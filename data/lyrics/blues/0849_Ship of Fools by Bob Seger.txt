"Tell me quick" said Old McFee
"What's this all have to do with me?
I've spent all my time at sea a loner
Is there something else I should know?
Something hidden down below
The level of your conversation?"
Well he turned away before the answer
Though I yelled aloud he refused to hear
It became too clear

[Verse 2]
So it went as we put out
I was left in constant doubt
Everything I asked about seemed private
The captain strolled the bridge one night
I stopped him in the evening light
To ask him would it be all right to join him
But he stood there like some idol
And he listened like some temple
And then he turned away

[Verse 3]
All along the fateful coast
We moved silent like a ghost
The timeless sea of tireless host possessed us
The wind came building from the cold northwest
And soon the waves began to crest
Crashing cross the forward deck, all hands lost
I alone survived the sinking
I alone possess the tools
On that ship of fools
You might also like[Outro]
Ship of fools
On that ship of fools
That ship of fools
