If you wanna go and leave your man
Go on, I'll understand
But then the night gets dark, all is still
Pray for me, I know you will
Hard row to hoe all by yourself

[Verse 2]
We hit the city, it swallow you whole
You got no friends darlin'
To satisfy your soul
And then the sidewalk ends, lights all red
You say to yourself, better off dead
Hard row to hoe all by yourself

[Verse 3]
Walk out on me
Walk out on him
You need no man to do you in
But if the night gets dark, all is still
I'll pray for you, you know I will
Hard row to hoe all by yourself
All by yourself
All by yourself
All by yourself
All by yourselfYou might also like
