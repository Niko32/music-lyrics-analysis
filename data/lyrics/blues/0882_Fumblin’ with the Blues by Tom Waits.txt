Friday left me fumblin' with the blues
And it's hard to win when you always lose
'Cause the nightspots spend your spirit, beat your head against the wall
Two dead-ends and you've still got to choose

[Verse 2]
You know, the bartenders, they all know my name
And they catch me when I'm pullin' up lame
And I'm a pool shootin' shimmy shyster shakin' my head
When I should be living clean instead

[Verse 3]
You know, the ladies I've been seeing off and on
Well, they spend your love and then they're gone
You can't be lovin' someone who is savage and cruel, yeah
Take your love and then they leave on out of town, you know they do

[Clarinet Solo]

[Verse 4]
Well now, fallin' in love is such a breeze
But it's standing up that's so hard for me
I wanna squeeze you, but I'm scared to death I'd break your back
You know your perfume, well, it won't let me be

And you know, the bartenders all know my name
And they catch me when I'm pulling up lame
I'm a pool shooting shimmy shyster shakin' my head
When I should be living clean instead

[Verse 5]
Well, come on baby, let your love light shine
Gotta bury me inside of your fire
Because your eyes are enough to blind me, you're like looking at the sun
You gotta whisper, tell me I'm the one

[Outro]
Come on and whisper, tell me I'm the one
Gotta whisper, tell me I'm the one
Come on and whisper, tell me I'm the one
