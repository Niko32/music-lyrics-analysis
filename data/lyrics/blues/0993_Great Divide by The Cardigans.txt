There's a monster growing in our heads
Raised up on the wicked things we've said

[Pre-Chorus]
A great divide between us now
Something we should know

[Chorus]
There's something to remember
And something to forget
As long as we remember
There's something to regret
Something we should know

[Verse 2]
There's a mountain higher than we knew
It's high but such a bitter view

[Pre-Chorus]
A great divide between us now
Something we should know

[Chorus]
There's something to remember
And something to forget
As long as we remember
There's something to regret
You might also like[Bridge]
A great divide between us now
On different sides of a great divide

[Chorus]
There's something to remember
And something to forget
As long as we remember
There's something to regret
Something we should know
