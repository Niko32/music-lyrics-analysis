Up in smoke
That's where my money goes
In my lungs
And sometimes up my nose
When troubled times
Begin to bother me
I take a toke
And all my cares
Go up in smoke

[Cheech]
Up in smoke
Donde todos es libre
There are no signs 
Que dice no fumer 
So I roll un "bomber"
Y me doy, un buen toke-ay 
Y despues I choke 
Y todos mis cares 
Go up in smoke 
Come on let's go get high

[Cast]
Up in smoke
That's where I wanna be
Cause when I'm high
The world below
Don't bother me
When life begins
To be one long
And dangerous road
I take a toke
And all my cares
Go up in smokeYou might also like
