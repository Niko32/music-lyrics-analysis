Way over yonder
Is a place that I know
Where I can find shelter
From a-hunger and cold

[Chorus]
And the sweet tastin' good life
Is so easily found
Way over yonder
That's where I'm bound

[Verse 2]
I know, when I get there
The first thing I'll see
Is the sun shining golden (Sun shining golden)
Shining right down on me

[Verse 3]
Then trouble's gonna lose me
Worry leave me behind
And I'll stand up proudly
In true peace of mind
Talking 'bout a, talking 'bout a

[Verse 4]
Way over yonder
Is a place I have seen
In a garden of wisdom
From some long ago dream
Oh, yeah

[Verse 5]
Ooh-ooh, maybe tomorrow
I'll find my way
To the land where the honey runs
In rivers each day

[Chorus]
And the sweet tastin' good life
Is so easily found
Way over yonder
That's where I'm bound

[Outro]
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ohh
Oh, way over yonder
That's where I'm bound
