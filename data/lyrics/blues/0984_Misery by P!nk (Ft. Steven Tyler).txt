Shadows are fallin' all over town
Another night, and these blues got me down
Oh, misery, I sure could use some company
Ooh, sing it, girl
Since you've been gone, I ain't been the same
I carry the weight like an old ball and chain
Guess it's all meant to be
For love to cause such misery

[Chorus: Both, P!nk]
Oh misery, oh misery
Tell me, why does my heart make a fool of me?
Seems it's my destiny
For love to cause me misery

[Verse 2: P!nk, Steven Tyler, Both]
And, oh, I've been down this road before
With a passion that turns into pain
And each time I saw love walk out the door
I swore I'd never get caught again
But ain't it true? It takes what it takes
And sometimes we get too smart too late
Haha, one more heartache for me
Another night in misery, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: P!nk, Steven Tyler, Both]
Oh, oh
Oh, and oh misery, oh misery
Tell me, why does my heart make a fool of me?
Oh misery, oh misery, yeah
Tell me why, why, why, why, why, why does this
Heart make a fool of me?
Seems it's my destiny
For love to cause misery, oh
Misery
Guess it's all meant to be
For love to cause me misery, oh, no, yeah
Misery
