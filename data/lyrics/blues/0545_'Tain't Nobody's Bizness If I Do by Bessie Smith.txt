That folks don't criticize me
But I'm goin' to do just as I want to anyway
And don't care if they all despise me

If I should take a notion
To jump into the ocean
'Tain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do do

If I go to church on Sunday
Then just shimmy down on Monday
Ain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do

If my friend ain't got no money
And I say "Take all mine, honey"
'Tain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do do

If I give him my last nickel
And it leaves me in a pickle
'Tain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I do

Well I'd rather my man would hit me
Than to jump right up and quit me
'Tain't nobody's bizness if I do, do, do do

I swear I won't call no copper
If I'm beat up by my papa
'Tain't nobody's bizness if I do, if I doYou might also like
