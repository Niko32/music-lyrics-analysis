He wants to dream like a young man
With the wisdom of an old man
He wants his home and security
He wants to live like a sailor at sea

[Chorus]
Beautiful loser
Where you gonna fall
When you realize
You just can't have it all?

[Verse 2]
He's your oldest and your best friend
If you need him, he'll be there again
He's always willing to be second-best
A perfect lodger, a perfect guest

[Chorus]
Beautiful loser
Read it on the wall
And realize
You just can't have it all
You just can't have it all

[Post-Chorus]
You just can't have it all
Oh, oh, can't have it all
You can try, you can try, but you can't have it all
Ah yeah
You might also like[Bridge]
He'll never make any enemies, enemies (No)
He won't complain if he's caught in a freeze (Nah)
He'll always ask, he'll always say please
Ooh

[Chorus]
Beautiful loser
Never take it all
'Cause it's easier
And faster when you fall
You just don't need it all
Oh, you just don't need it all

[Outro]
You just don't need it all
Ooh
Just don't need it all
