Dead leaves, seaweed, rotten eggs, too
Stir them in my witches’ brew
I got magic, alakazam-akazoo
Spider web, moldy bread, mucky mud, too
Stir them in my witches’ brew
I got magic, alakazam-akazoo

[Chorus]
Oooh, my witches’ brew
Ooo what’s it gonna do to you?
Boo!

[Verse 2]
Floor wax, thumb tacks, purple paint, too
Stir them in my witches’ brew
I got magic, alakazam-akazoo
Finger nails, lunch pails, apple cores, too
Stir them in my witches’ brew
I got magic, alakazam-akazoo

[Chorus]
Oooh, my witches’ brew
Oooh, what’s it gonna do to you?
Boo!

Wrinkled prunes, mushrooms, motor oil, too
Stir them in my witches’ brew
I got magic, alakazam-akazoo
I got magic, alakazam-akazoo
