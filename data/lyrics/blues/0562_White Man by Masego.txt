White man, white man, yeah
Why you tryna take these checks from me?
Why you tryna get the best of me?
Why you ain’t never arresting shit?

[Verse 2]
White man, white man
Why you always got your racism?
Why is everybody privileging?
Why you tryna get the vote for them?

[Verse 3]
Black man, black man
Why you so, so, so negative?
Why you ain’t working hard enough?
Why you complaining every day?

[Verse 4]
Chinese man, Chinese man
Why you gotta overcharge me suh?
All I wanna do is feed my young
Maybe even feed the homies too
Maybe even feed my brand new boo
And show her I’m a man, I’m a man
You might also like[Verse 5]
Why you trying to get the best of me?
What they tryna do, arresting me?
Why aren't none of you facing me?
Play the E-E-E, to R&B
Gonna get back to trap, that's on them
Gonna get myself like violent
See it in my name and language, yeah

[Chorus]
Uh, yo, yeah, uh
I swear my worst fear is falling in love, man
I swear my worst fear is having some kids, yeah
I swear my worst fear is disappointing my parents
I hope I never do it, it’s apparent, and I
I hope I never break another heart
I hope my good friends not fallin’ in love
I hope they’re so patient with me now
'Cause I’m gon' keep grinding
'Cause I’m gon' keep grinding

[Outro]
White man, white man, ayy
Why you tryna take these checks from me?
Why you tryna get the best of me?
Why you ain’t never arresting shit?
