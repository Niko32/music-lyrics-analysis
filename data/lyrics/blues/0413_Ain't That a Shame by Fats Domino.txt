You made me cry
When you said goodbye
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

[Verse 2]
You broke my heart
When you said we'll part
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame

[Verse 3]
Oh, well, goodbye
Although I'll cry
Ain't that a shame?
My tears fell like rain
Ain't that a shame?
You're the one to blame
