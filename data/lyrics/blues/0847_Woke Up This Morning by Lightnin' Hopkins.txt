This morning I woke up, woke up, I woke up this morning
Yes, poor Lightin' sure was please
Woah, I woke up this morning
Yes, poor Lightin' sure was please
Woah, I heard somebody callin'
That were my little girl callin' me

[Verse 2]
She called kind of lonesome, she said
She said "Lightin', oh Lightnin'
Darlin', do you know something keeps on worrying me
Woah, lord have mercy
Yes, something keeps on worryin' me
Woah, I know just around here somewhere
But I'm bothered wondering where can you be"
And I broke down, and I cried a little while I say

[Outro]
