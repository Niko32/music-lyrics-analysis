I was thinking 'bout parkin' the other night
We was out on the back road
Me and my baby was just gettin' right
All systems on overload
Radio blastin' in the front seat
Turning out the music fine
And we were snuggled up in the back seat
Making up for lost time

[Chorus]
Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Comin' from the body heat

[Verse 2]
You can wine and dine with a man all night
With good intent
But there's somethin' about a confrontation on the back road
Breaks down the defense

[Chorus]
Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Comin' from the body heat
Steamy windows
It ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows
Comin' from the body heat
You might also like[Verse 3]
There's a sound outside the front door
And I know it's just the wind
But it makes him snuggle up just a little bit closer
And starts things happenin' again
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Steamy windows
It ain't nobody can see
Steamy windows
Comin' from the body heat
Steamy windows
Zero visibility
Steamy windows
Comin' from the body heat, yeah

[Outro]
Steamy windows
Steamy windows
Steamy windows
Yeah, zero visibility
Yeah
Steamy windows
