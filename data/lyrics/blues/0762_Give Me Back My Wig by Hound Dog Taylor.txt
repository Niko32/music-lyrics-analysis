Honey now let your head go bald
Give me back my wig
Honey now let your head go bald
Really didn't have no business
Honey buyin' you no wig at all

Takin' me downtown
Say four forty nine
When I get down there
I swear, nine ninety nine

You just give me back my wig
Honey now let your head go bald
Really didn't have no business
Honey buyin' you no wig at all

Yeah my Mama told me
And your good friend too
When you get that wig
That's the way you gonna do

You just give me back my wig
Honey now let your head go bald
Really didn't have no business
Honey buyin' you no wig at all
You might also likeGoodbye little one
All I got to say
Give me back my wig and be
On your merry way

You just give me back my wig
Honey, now let your head go bald
Really didn'thave no business
Honey buyin' you no wig at all
