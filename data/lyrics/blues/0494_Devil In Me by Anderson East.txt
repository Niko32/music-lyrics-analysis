There's a girl in Shelbyville
Gave her life to Jesus
First Antioch Baptist Church, where her dad preaches
She's pretty as her mama; she's only 23
And she could be an angel, Lord
Cause she's bringing out the devil in me

[Chorus]
Lord, forgive me for what I'm thinking
Cause it's Saturday night and I'm high and I've been drinking
But come tomorrow morning across the aisle
I look over and see her smile
Bow my head and the choir sings
Lord, forgive me; she's bringing out the devil in me

[Verse 2]
Sundress on a willow tree
Smooth on the water
I know the Lord's been good to me when I look at the preacher's daughter
But she's my Delilah; she brings me to my knees
And she could be an angel
Cause she's bringing out the devil in me

[Chorus]
Lord, forgive me for what I'm thinking
Saturday night and I'm high and I've been drinking
But come tomorrow morning across the aisle
I look over and see her smile
Bow my head and the choir sings
Lord, forgive me; she's bringing out the devil in me

[Chorus]
Lord, forgive me for what I'm thinking
Saturday night and I'm high and I've been drinking
But come tomorrow morning across the aisle
I look over and see her smile
Bow my head and the choir sings
Lord, forgive me; she's bringing out the devil in me
Lord, forgive me; she's bringing out the devil in me
