If it keeps on rainin', levee's goin' to break
And the water gonnna come in and we'll have no place to stay

Well all last night I sat on the levee and moan
Well all last night I sat on the levee and moan
Thinkin' 'bout my baby and my happy home

If it keeps on rainin' levee's goin' to break
If it keeps on rainin' levee's goin' to break
And all these people will have no place to stay

Now look here mama what am I to do?
Now look here mama what am I, I to do?
I ain't got nobody to tell my troubles to

I worked on the levee, mama, both night and day
I worked on the levee, mama, both night and day
I ain't got nobody to keep the water away

Oh cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do no good
Oh cryin' won't help you, prayin' won't do no good
Whenever the levee breaks momma, you got to lose

I worked on the levee, mama, both night and day
I worked on the levee, mama, both night and day
I worked so hard to keep the water away

I had a woman, she wouldn't do for me
I'm going back to my used to be

Oh, mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Yeah, the mean old levee taught me to weep and moan
Told me leave my baby and my happy home
