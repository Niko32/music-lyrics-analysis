I'm walkin'
Yes, indeed
And I'm talkin'
'Bout you and me
I'm hopin'
That you come back to me, yeah
I'm lonely
As I can be
I'm waitin'
For your company
I'm hopin'
That you come back to me

[Bridge]
What you gonna do when the well runs dry?
You gonna run away and hide
I'm gonna run right by your side
For you, pretty baby, I'll even die

[Chorus]
I'm walkin'
Yes, indeed
And I'm talkin'
'Bout you and me
I'm hopin'
That you come back to me
You might also like[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm walkin'
Yes, indeed
And I'm talkin'
'Bout you and me
I'm hopin'
That you come back to me, yeah
I'm lonely
As I can be
I'm waitin'
For your company
I'm hopin'
That you come back to me

[Bridge]
What you gonna do when the well runs dry?
You gonna sit right down and cry
What you gonna do when I say bye-bye?
All you gonna do is dry your eye

[Chorus]
I'm walkin'
Yes, indeed
And I'm talkin'
'Bout you and me
I'm hopin'
That you come back to me
