I'm gonna take you to your mama, pay day
Pay day, pay day
I'm gonna take you to your mama, pay day

Just 'bout a week ago, I stole me a ham of meat
I'm gonna keep my skillet greasy if I can
If I can, if I can...

Well, the rabbit in the log, I ain't got no rabbit dog
Lord, I hate to see that rabbit get away
Get away, get away
Lord, I hate to see that rabbit get away

Baby, I did all I can do, and I can't get along with you
I'm gonna take you to your mama, pay day
Pay day, pay day...

Well, I did all I can do, and I can't get along with you
I'm gonna take you to your mama, pay day
Pay day, pay day...You might also like
