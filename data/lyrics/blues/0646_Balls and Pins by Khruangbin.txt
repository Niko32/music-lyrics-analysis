From sand and stone
Level and true
I built my house on shifting sands
By my hands, a realm on Earth
And from the date
A giant palm
A golden shield for every man
In time before we couldn't stand
We're the first

[Chorus]
And my throne is your throne
And the rings on my hand
Are your gold
And my sun is your sun to the end
And my bones are your bones
From the grain to the sand
To the stone

[Interlude]

[Verse 2]
The crushing wind
The serpent's tooth
Buried me in the shifting sands
From my hands, it fell on the ground
A rotten date
Seen in the palm
The golden shield, it weighed us down
A sunken tomb
A phantom town, we're the last
You might also like[Chorus]
And my throne is your throne
And the rings on my hand
Are your gold
And my sun is your sun to the end
And my bones are your bones
From the grain to the sand
To the stone

[Outro]
To the stone
To the stone
To the stone
To the stone
To the stone
