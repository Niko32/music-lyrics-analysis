Eagle in the dark
Feathers in the pages
Monkeys in my heart
Are rattling their cages

[Verse 2]
Found a way to blue
Another ghost to follow
Said, "It's only up to you"
And that's the hardest pill to swallow
Hmm-mm, hmm-mm

[Verse 3]
You never get to choose
You live on what they sent you
And you know they're gonna use
The things you love against you

[Verse 4]
One foot in the grave
One foot in the shower
There's never time to save
You're paying by the hour

[Chorus]
And that's just the way it goes
Falling awake
And that's just the way it goes

[Verse 5]
Slipping through the bars
Aware of the danger
Of riding in the cars
Taking candy from strangers

[Verse 6]
And you're never out of hand
Never out of pocket
I'm supersonic man
Do you wanna buy a rocket? Hmm

[Chorus]
Oh, that's just the way it goes
Falling awake
Falling awake
Hmm-mm
And that's just the way it goes
Falling awake
Falling awake

[Verse 7]
Eagle in the dark
Feathers in the pages
Monkeys in my heart
Are rattling their cages
[Verse 8]
I could learn to play the game
I could learn to run the hustle
If I only had the brains
The money or the muscle
