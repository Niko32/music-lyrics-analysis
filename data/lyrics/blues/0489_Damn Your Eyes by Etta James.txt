I can do what I want
I'm in complete control
That's what I tell myself
I got a mind of my own
I'll be alright alone
Don't need anybody else
I gave myself a good talking to
No more being a fool for you
But I see you and all I remember
Is how you make me wanna surrender

[Chorus]
Damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
Making me wanna stay
Damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
Making me fall in love again
Damn your eyes

[Verse 2]
It's always the same
You say that you'll change
Somehow you never do
I believe all your lies
I look in your eyes
You make it all seem true
I guess I see what I wanna see
Or is it my heart just deceiving me?
'Cause with that look I know so well
I fall completely under your spell
You might also like[Chorus]
Damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
For making me wanna stay
Damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
For making me fall in love again
Damn your eyes

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
You keep deliberately deceiving me
Making me see what I wanna see

[Chorus]
Damn your eyes
For taking my breath away, hey
Making me wanna stay
Damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
For making me fall in love again
Damn your eyes

[Outro]
Damn your eyes
For taking my breath away
Damn, damn your eyes
For getting my hopes up high
For making me fall in love, fall in love again
Damn, damn your eyes
