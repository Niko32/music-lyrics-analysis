She's my baby, she belongs to me
But yesterday, she walked home all alone
Everybody else looks at my baby
Then they want to know her name

[Verse 2]
But baby's feelin' bad today
She said she's thinkin' of goin' away
Oh baby, I'm cryin' and my body's flyin'
But I'll remember you

[Chorus]
She's my baby, ain't that something?
But I know she belongs to you

[Verse 3]
Yesterday was another day when I
Saw you, baby, walkin' home alone

[Verse 4]
I'm feelin' sorry, I called you, but I
I guess that I forgot your name

[Verse 5]
But baby's feelin' bad today
She said she's thinkin' of goin' away
You might also like[Verse 6]
But she's just like lightning, she goes right through you
Then you know you'll never be the same

[Verse 7]
Now everybody looks all around the corner
Just to see your baby walkin' home

[Chorus]
She's my baby, ain't that something?
But I know she belongs to you

[Outro]
She belongs to you
