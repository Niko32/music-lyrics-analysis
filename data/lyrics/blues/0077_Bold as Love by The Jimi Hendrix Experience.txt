Anger, he smiles
Towering in shiny metallic purple armor
Queen Jealousy, envy waits behind him
Her fiery green gown sneers at the grassy ground
Blue are the life-giving waters taken for granted
They quietly understand
Once happy turquoise armies lay opposite ready
But wonder why the fight is on

[Chorus]
But they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
Yeah, they're all bold as love
Just ask the axis

[Verse 2]
My red is so confident he flashes trophies of war And ribbons of euphoria
Orange is young, full of daring
But very unsteady for the first go 'round
My yellow in this case is not so mellow
In fact, I'm trying to say it's frightened like me
And all of these emotions of mine keeps holding me from
Giving my life to a rainbow like you

[Chorus]
But I'm uh, yeah, l'm bold as love
Yeah, yeah, well I'm bold, bold as love
Hear me talking, girl
I'm bold as love
Just ask the axis
He knows everything
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah
