Little sister, there's blood on the tracks
And a lit cigarette but you're not comin' back
To a town that was built on black gold and iron ore

[Verse 2]
And the kettle got hot, and it boiled and it steamed
And you can't run away from the worst of your dreams
They'll string you up when you're tryin' to fall fast asleep

[Chorus]
She wore black dresses
And she never cried in the morning
She's got a bottle and papers
So she can forget her name
She wore black dresses
And she never smiled in the morning
She's got a bottle and papers
So she can forget her name

[Verse 3]
Well her hometown was built by a few greedy men
And people tell me she was descended from them
She's been playin' in the darkness ever since she was a kid

[Verse 4]
And she doesn't mourn for her man's come and gone
She's worn the color of black all along
And she was born with a stone where there shoulda been a heart
You might also like[Chorus]
She wore black dresses
And she never cried in the morning
She's got a bottle and papers
So she can forget her name
She wore black dresses
And she never smiled in the morning
She's got a bottle and papers
So she can forget her name

[Bridge]
Did you ever meet a girl who was born the victim of a name?
I know, 'cuz I'm a boy who was born the victim of a name
Did you ever meet a girl who was born the victim of a name?
I know, 'cuz I'm a boy who was born the victim of a name

[Verse 1]
Little sister, there's blood on the tracks
And a lit cigarette but you're not comin' back
To a town that was built on black gold and iron ore

[Chorus]
She wore black dresses
And she never cried in the morning
She's got a bottle and papers
So she can forget her name
She wore black dresses
And she never smiled in the morning
She's got a bottle and papers
So she can forget her name
She's got a bottle and papers
So she can forget her name
She's got a bottle and papers
So she can forget her name
