The old guy next to me is loud as day
Ramble and ramble, while eatin' his pie
He dropped his wallet, now it's mine, uh-huh

Sorry old man, but that's just the way that it is
Don't bother none
Won't help at all to worry 'bout it

Picked up the wallet and slipped outside
I walked around and walked around and walked around town
I found my nerve and a good place to hide
Only to find no cash inside, uh-huh

Oh well, I guess that's just the way that it is
Don't bother none
Won't help at all to worry 'bout it

I got thirsty so I went to a bar
Met a little darlin' with the face of a star
In the mornin', woke up to find
She stole my car along with my heart, yeah

Oh well, I guess that's just the way that it is
Don't bother none
Won't help at all to worry 'bout it
You might also likeI wish she'd give me back my heart, uh-huh

Oh well, I guess that's just the way that it is
Don't bother none
Won't help at all to worry 'bout it
