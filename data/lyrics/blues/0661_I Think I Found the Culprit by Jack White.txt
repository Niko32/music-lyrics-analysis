I think I found the culprit
Looks like you, it must be you
Ain't found nothin' better yet
What's the matter with you, ya' got nothin' to do?

[Verse]
Two crumbs on my windowsill
Two birds sittin' there perfectly still
One of them up to no good
The other one doin' what he totally should

[Refrain]
I think I found the culprit
Looks like you, it must be you
Ain't found nothin' better yet
What's the matter with you, ya' got nothin' to do?

[Chorus]
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun

Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
You might also like[Refrain]
I think I found the culprit
Looks like you, it must be you
Ain't found nothin' better yet
What's the matter with you, ya' got nothin' to do?

[Chorus]
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
Birds of a feather may lay together
But the uglier one is always under the gun
