Mother, you've given me breath
The stitches in family threads
And I know you've found it hard, so hard
But I know we'll be just fine

[Verse 2]
Father, embracing me
Side by side, gloriously
And you've struggled with yourself
But you're selfless
And I know we'll be just fine

[Chorus]
And it's hard to say but I'm feeling more myself
Let's live each day, like we're raising up our health
There's more to me that you will see
I'm cool and feeling like, we'll be just fine
Just fine

[Verse 3]
Lucille, mellowing me
Forgiving mistakes through sympathy
And I know I've been so cold, so cold
But I know we'll be just fine
You might also like[Chorus]
It's hard to say but I'm feeling more myself
Let's live each day, like we're raising up our health
There's more to me that you will see
I'm cool and feeling like we'll be just fine
Be just fine
