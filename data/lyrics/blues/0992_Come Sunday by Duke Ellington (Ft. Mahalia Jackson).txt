Lord, dear Lord of love
God almighty, God above
Please look down and see my people through

[Verse 2]
God, dear God of love
God almighty, God above
Please look down and see my people through

[Bridge]
I believe the sun and moon
Will shine up in the sky
When the day is gray
I know it's clouds passing by

[Verse 3]
He'll give peace and comfort
To every troubled mind
Come Sunday, oh come Sunday, that's the day

[Bridge]
Often we'll feel weary
But he knows our every care
Go to him in secret
He will hеar your every prayer

Liliеs on the valley
They neither toil nor spin
And flowers bloom and springtime birds sing

[Bridge]
Often we'll feel weary
But he knows our every care
Go to him in secret
He will hear your every prayer

[Verse 5]
Up from dawn 'til sunset
Man work hard all day
Come Sunday, oh come Sunday, that's the day
