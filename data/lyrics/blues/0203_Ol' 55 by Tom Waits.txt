Well, my time went so quickly, I went lickety-splitly
Out to my ol' fifty-five
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive

[Chorus]
Now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer
Oh Lord, let me tell you that the feeling getting stronger

[Verse 2]
And it's six in the morning, gave me no warning
I had to be on my way
Well, there's trucks all a-passing me and the lights all a-flashin'
I'm on my way home from your place

[Chorus]
And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Stars beginning to fade
And I lead the parade
Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer
Oh Lord, let me tell you the feeling getting stronger
You might also like[Verse 1]
And my time went so quickly, I went lickety-splitly
Out to my ol' fifty-five
As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy
God knows I was feeling alive

[Chorus]
And now the sun's coming up
I'm riding with Lady Luck
Freeway cars and trucks
Freeway cars and trucks
Freeway cars and trucks
