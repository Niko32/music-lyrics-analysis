Bittersweet thing, could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake?
Feel it in my brain, tall shot of pain
Pour a little out now for the love that we've made

[Pre-Chorus]
I feel it in the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see ya but you're gone, telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth, I dive in, but I can't

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
Say, now tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me, baby, oh, yeah, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?

[Verse 2]
Got that poundin' on my brain, so I drowned it away
When the sun comes up tomorrow, you can find me doin' the same
'Cause I just can't forget the way we turned out this bad
And now, the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And then I feel it in the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see ya but you're gone, telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth, I dive in, but I can't

[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away (No, I can't)
All these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
Say, tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Oh, tell me, baby, one time, come on, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?

[Bridge]
Break it down
I can't drink you
No, I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
No, I can't drink you away
[Chorus]
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away (No, I can't)
All these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin I'm livin' in

[Post-Chorus]
Say, so tell me, baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me, baby, oh, yeah, one time, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak, yeah?
Oh, yeah, tell me, baby, can't they make a medicine for my heartbreak, heartbreak?
Tell me, baby, can't they make a medicine for my heartbreak?

[Chorus]
'Cause I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of my friends
I can't drink you away
All these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin I'm livin' in
