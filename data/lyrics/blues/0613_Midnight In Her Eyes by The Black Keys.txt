Midnight is in her eyes
Teardrops like a child
You never thought about going wrong
Now you wonder where your man has gone
Midnight is in her eyes

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Lately you're feeling low
Heartache on the floor
Your manic ways got the best of you
But your heart is going to see you through
Lately, you're feeling low

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
I see her everywhere
Long amber hair
Calling out my name
I'm calling just the same

Midnight is in her eyes
Teardrops like a child
You never thought about going wrong
Now you wonder where your man has gone
Midnight is in her eyes

[Outro]
Is in her eyes
Is in her eyes
Is in her eyes
