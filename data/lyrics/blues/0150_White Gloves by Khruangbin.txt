[Verse 1]
She was a queen
She had a house
She was a fighter
She was a queen
Had a good dude
Brought me a rabbit
She was a queen
Wearing white gloves
But she kept 'em clean
Classy Lady
But she wasn't quiet
She was a queen

[Interlude]
(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
One day she was gone
She died in a fight
'Cause she was a fighter
But she was a queen

She was a queen
She was a queen
(Ooh)
She was a queen
