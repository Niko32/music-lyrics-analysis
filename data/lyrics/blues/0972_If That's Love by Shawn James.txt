He wakes to find her in his bed
Naked from the night before
She wakes and grins from ear to ear
Thinking that she's won his heart
He tells her, "Get your things and leave
Until we meet again"
She wonders if she's wrong or right
To have share her love with him

[Chorus]
If that's love then I don't know what is
If that's true then I'm a fraud
If it's real then I must seem like such a fool
To have save my love for one

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
If that's love then I don't know what is
If that's true then I'm a fraud
If it's real then I must seem like such fool
To have save my love for one

[Outro]
No, you don't really know what love is
No, you don't know love is
No, you haven't got a clueYou might also like
