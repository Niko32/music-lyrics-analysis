Damn, boy, why you make it so hard?
Stop puttin' yo' foot on my heart
I know I did my wrong, I know I did my dirt
Didn't know how bad I would hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
Told you, "Walk out that door, and you can keep your last name"
Now I'm down on my knees, it's a shame

[Chorus]
I'm beggin' and pleadin'
(Beggin' and pleadin', hopin' and wishin' for a change)
Forgive me
(Beggin' and pleadin', hopin' and wishin')
I'm beggin' and pleadin'
(Beggin' and pleadin', hopin' and wishin' for a change)
Forgive me
(Beggin' and pleadin', hopin' and wishin')
Told you, "Walk out that door, and you can keep your last name"
Now I'm down on my knees, it's a shame
Good God almighty

[Verse 2]
Damn, boy, why you make it so hard?
Stop puttin' your foot on my heart

Got so bad, yeah, I stopped wearin' my ring
