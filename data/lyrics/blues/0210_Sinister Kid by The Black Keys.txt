Well, the crooks are out, and the streets are gray
You know I wouldn't have it any other way, yeah
Your mother's words, they're, they're ringin' still
But your mother don't pay our bills, yeah

[Chorus]
A sinister kid is a kid who
Runs to meet his maker
A drop dead sprint from the day he's born
Straight into his maker's arms
And that's me, that's me
The boy with the broken halo
That's me, and that's me
The devil won't let me be

[Verse 2]
I got a tortured mind, and my blade is sharp
A bad combination in the dark
If I kill a man in the first degree
Baby, would you, would you flee with me? Yeah

[Chorus]
A sinister kid is a kid who
Runs to meet his maker
A drop dead sprint from the day he's born
Straight into his maker's arms
And that's me, and that's me
The boy with the broken halo
And that's me, that's me
The devil won't let me be

A sinister kid is a kid who

Straight into his maker's arms
And that's me, and that's me

That's me, and that's me
The devil won't let me be
