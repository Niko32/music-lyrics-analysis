One bourbon, one scotch and one beer

I said hey mister bartender, come here
I want another drink and I want it now
My girl, she gone, she been gone two night
I ain't seen the girl since night before last
Wanna get drunk, get her off my mind
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
And then I sit there, drinkin, gettin' stoned, yeah yeah
After a while, I looked down the bar, at the bartender
I said Hey!  "Whadda ya want?"
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

Well that girl, she gone, gone two night
I haven't seen the girl since night before last
I wanna get drunk, get her off of my mind
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

And I sat there, gettin stoned, mellow
Feelin so good, so good
I looked down the bar, at the bartender
I said hey hey!  "Whadda ya want?"
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer
You might also likeWell that girl, she gone, she gone two night
I haven't seen the girl since night before last
I wanna get drunk, get her off of my mind
One bourbon, one scotch, one beer

Then I sit there, drinkin
After a while, I lose my head
I looked on the wall, at the clock on the wall
By that time, it was quarter to two
Last call for alcohol
I looked down the bar, at the bartender
I said "Hey, whadda ya want?"
One bourbon, one scotch and one beer
