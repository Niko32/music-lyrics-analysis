And he floats outside my prison window mocking those within
And he sings to me real low, it's hell to where you go
For you did murder Kate McCannon
When I first met Tom McCannon, I was working in the mines
Said he had himself a dark-haired daughter with long, green eyes
When she and I did meet, she was bathing in the creek
Prettiest girl in the whole damn holler, that ain't no lie

So I went a courtin' Kate McCannon
Got me a job and I quit my ramblin'
And every day I'd save a quarter of my pay
I could buy a diamond ring
Lord, and one day I come home to find
My darlin' angel's not inside
So I made for the creek
Where she and I did meet
And found her with some other lover

And I put three rounds into Kate McCannonYou might also like
