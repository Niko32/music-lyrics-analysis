Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeers pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing, all is merry and bright
So hang your stockings and say your prayers
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Verse 2]
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He's got a bag that's filled with toys for boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle, oh what a beautiful sight
So jump in bed and cover your head
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He doesn't care if you're rich or poor
He loves you just the same
Santa Claus knows we're all God's children
That makes everything right
So fill your hearts with Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Peace on Earth will come to all if we just follow the light
