Well, I remember what you told me
Said drinkin' was unholy
So, Lord, can You point me to the creek
And I still keep it with me
Tucked under all the memories
Your voice echoin' throughout those trees

[Verse 2]
And through unfavored weather
And holes in the leather
These boots still covered in tar
Well, I'm still prayin' to the heavens
And hopin' for them sevens
But hope only gets a man so far when

[Chorus]
This game of life plays heavy on my heart and
Love is tough, but lonеliness is twice as hard and
I'll carry that 'bout evеrywhere I go
And they say pressure makes diamonds, how the hell am I still coal?

[Verse 3]
Now I've seen Heaven without dyin'
Met the Devil without tryin'
And they both seem to wanna talk to me
But I'm all outta luck now
And my dreams aren't worth a buck
How it's tough tryin' to land on my feet when
You might also like[Chorus]
This game of life plays heavy on my heart and
Love is tough, but loneliness is twice as hard and
I'll carry that 'bout everywhere I go
And they say pressure makes diamonds, how the hell am I still coal?

[Bridge]
When every day is gettin' colder
Since that day in October
When you told me it was over, so I left
'Cause if you need me, well, I told ya
I'm on the better side of sober
Tryin' to find a four-leaf clover
To get me out of this mess

[Chorus]
This game of life plays heavy on my heart and
Love is tough, but loneliness is twice as hard and
I'll carry that 'bout everywhere I go
And they say pressure makes diamonds, how the hell
This game of life plays heavy on my heart and
Love is tough, but loneliness is twice as hard and
I'll carry that 'bout everywhere I go
And they say pressure makes diamonds, how the hell am I still coal?
