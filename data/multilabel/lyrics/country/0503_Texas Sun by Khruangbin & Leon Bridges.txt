You say you like the wind blowin' through your hair
Well, come on roll with me 'til the sun goes down

[Refrain]
Texas sun

[Verse 2]
Say you wanna hit the highway while the engine roars
Well, come on, roll with me 'til the sun goes down

[Refrain]
That Texas sun, oh yeah
Texas sun

[Verse 3]
Caressing you from Fort Worth to Amarillo
Well, come on, roll with me 'til the sun dips low

[Refrain]
Texas sun
Texas sun, oh girl
That Texas sun

[Bridge]
When I'm far from home and them cold winds blow
Stuck out somewhere with folks I don't know
'Cause you keep me nice and you keep me warm
Wanna feel you on me, can't wait to get back there again

[Verse 4]
You say you like the wind blowing through your hair
Well, come on, roll with me 'til the sun goes down

[Interlude]
Ooh baby, you're so gorgeous
How 'bout you and me... take a little trip
In the big body?

[Outro]
Take a ride with me, baby, you by my side
How does it sound, you and I?
Oh girl
Take a ride with me, baby, you by my side
How does it sound, you and I?
Baby, oh
Take a ride with me, baby, you by my side
How does it sound, you and I?
