Everybody needs inspiration
Everybody needs a song
A beautiful melody
When the night's so long
'Cause there is no guarantee
That this life is easy

[Chorus]
Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

[Verse 2]
When I look at you, I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, when my world is falling apart
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

[Bridge]
You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that
Cover me, all I need
Every breath that I breathe
Don't you know you're beautiful?
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
When the waves
Are flooding the shore and I can't
Find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
I look at you
Yeah, yeah, oh (I look at you)
[Outro]
And you appear just like a dream to me
