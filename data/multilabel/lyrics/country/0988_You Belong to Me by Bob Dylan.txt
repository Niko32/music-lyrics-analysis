See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sun rise from a tropic isle
Just remember, darling, all the while
You belong to me

[Verse 2]
See the market place in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me

[Bridge]
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too
And blue

[Verse 3]
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to me

[Bridge]
I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too
And blue
You might also like[Verse 4]
Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to me
