If I fall in love with all my problems
Will they leave me too?
Or maybe I believed in all your lies
'Cause I believed in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Why were you somewhere else
When you were next to me?
I know you know it keeps me up
Did you think about her face
With your hands around my waist?
Did you even give a fuck?

[Chorus]
You can't spell "lonesome" without "me"
Mm, mm, mm
And there's no hope in misery
Mm, mm, mm
I can't escapе your history, oh
You can't spell "lonesome" without "mе"
You just can't

[Verse 2]
Tell me I was more
Than just a decent opportunity
Or will you tell me anything I wanna hear
To control how you're perceived?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Why were you somewhere else
When you were next to me?
I know you know it keeps me up
Isn't it kind of strange
How it all changed when
I wasn't the one they wanted you to love?

[Chorus]
You can't spell "lonesome" without "me"
Mm, mm, mm
And there's no hope in misery
Mm, mm, mm
I can't escape your history, oh
You can't spell "lonesome" without "me"
You just can't

[Outro]
Mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm
Mm, mm
Mm, mm, mm
