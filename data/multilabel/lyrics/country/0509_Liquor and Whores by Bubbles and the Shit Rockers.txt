"Liquor and Whores", take two

Liquor and whores
Liquor and whores
Cig'rettes and dope and mustard and baloney
Liquor and whores

[Verse 1]
Well, I was down
A-drinkin' at the Legion
And I met a girl
She was nice
She was pretty and pleasing

She said, "Hey, boy
We should do some marrying"
I said, "Sure, but before we do
There's something that you should know:"

[Chorus]
I like liquor and whores
Liquor and whores
Cig'rettes and dope and mustard and baloney
Liquor and whores

[Verse 2]
And then one night
Down at the Legion
She walked in
I was drunk on gin
Dancin' with a lady friend

And she said, "Hey boy
You better fly the fuck home"
I said, "No, 'cause of five little words
I coulda swore I said to you:"

[Coda]
I like liquor and whores

Cig'rettes and dope and mustard and baloney

Well, I like liquor and whores
(Whores!)
Liquor and whores
Cig'rettes and dope and mustard
And baloney
Liquor and whores
Liquor and whores!
