I've been holdin' this in
From the very first kiss
And I've been losin' my mind
Tryna keep up like this

[Pre-Chorus: Dustin Lynch]
But we both know that there comes a time
And I hate to sound harsh or unkind

[Chorus: Dustin Lynch & Karen Fairchild]
Love me or leave me alone
Hold me or just let me go
'Cause I've felt this fire for so long
So, baby, love me, love me, love me or leave me alone

[Verse 2: Dustin Lynch]
If we're just playin' along
Then we're just playin' ourselves
And I don't want you to roam
With somebody else

[Pre-Chorus: Dustin Lynch]
'Cause there's magic between you and I
And I hate this impatience of mine
You might also like[Chorus: Dustin Lynch & Karen Fairchild]
So, love me or leave me alone
Hold me or just let me go
'Cause I've felt this fire for so long
So, baby, love me, love me, love me or leave me alone

[Bridge: Dustin Lynch]
'Cause we both know that there comes a time
And I hate to sound harsh or unkind

[Chorus: Dustin Lynch & Karen Fairchild]
Love me or leave me alone
Hold me or just let me go
'Cause I've felt this fire for so long
So, baby, love me, love me, love me or leave me
Just a-love me, love me, love me or leave me alone
