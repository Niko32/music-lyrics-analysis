Honey, load up your questions
And pick up your sticks and your stones
And pretend I'm a shelter
For heartaches that don't have a home

[Pre-Chorus]
And choose the words that cut like a razor
And all that I'll say, is...

[Chorus]
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

[Verse 2]
Well, I wish I could say
That I've never been here before
But you know and I know
That I'll always come back for more

[Pre-Chorus]
Your love might be my damnation
But I'll cry to my grave
You might also like[Chorus]
Fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away
Aww, fire away
Take your best shot
Show me what you got
Honey, I'm not afraid
Rear back and take aim
And fire away

[Outro]
Fire away
Aww, fire away
Fire away
