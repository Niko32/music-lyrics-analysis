I wake up, a shower and then I start forging
It is poison, that gets you high, of very good quality
Phones never stop ringing
If it's not some female, it's because a client wants more

[Chorus: Peso Pluma & Natanael Cano]
And well wrapped the packages leave
No worries, I can't fail
I'm always ready to cross
Dust, wheels and also glass
Here the paper comes and goes
The girls very crazy leave
We enjoy this right or wrong
I'm not going to complain about this life

[Interlude: Natanael Cano]
¡Eah!
And very drunk with the double P
The corridos tumbados, just like that viejo

[Verse 2: Natanael Cano & Peso Pluma]
Wеll dressed with the Balеnciaga, bad ass corridos blasting
The girls were dancing very well and I'm Silver LV
I feel like I'm already flying carnal
And here we will never complain
Why are we going to turn back?, I will keep drunk

Well wrapped the packages leave
No worries, I can't fail
I'm always ready to cross
Dust, wheels and also glass
And well wrapped the packages leave
No worries, I can't fail
I'm always ready to cross
Dust, wheels and also glass
