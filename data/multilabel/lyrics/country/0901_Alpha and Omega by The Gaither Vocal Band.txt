He shall dwell within them
They shall be His people
And Almighty God will be with them"

"He shall wipe away all tears from their eyes
There shall be no more death

The former things have all past away"

"Behold, I make all things new"
He said unto me, "Write these words
For they are faithful and true"

It is done
It is done
It is done
