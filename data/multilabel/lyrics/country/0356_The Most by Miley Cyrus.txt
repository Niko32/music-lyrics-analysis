Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
This winter was as cold as you and I
I know you're home, hoping I'm alright
How many times have I left you in the deep?
I don't know why you still believe in me

[Chorus]
Oh, and even in my darkest days, even in my lowest place
You love me the most
And even when I can't stay, even when I run away
You love me the most
So why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause I know?
Why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause you love me the most?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Is it 'cause you love me the most?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Yeah

Your tender touch is the healing that I seek
I come to you when my judgement becomes weak
All that you are is all I ever need
I don't know why you still believe in me

[Chorus]
Oh, and even in my darkest days, even in my lowest place
You love me the most
And even when I can't stay, even when I run away
You love me the most
So why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause I know?
Why do I hurt you so? Is it 'cause you love me the most?

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Is it 'cause you love me the most?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, the most
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Is it 'cause I know? Yeah

[Outro]
How many times have I left you in the deep?
I don't know why you still believe in me
