Here's what he'll do, he'll play it cool
When he hangs out with a woman like you
Say he ain't pressed by all your success
Tell you he's different than all of the rest

[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna give it all and give it all
But you won't get it back
I'm tellin' you, it's gonna hurt
Stay away from a boy like that

[Chorus]
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feelin' insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
Say, "He's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you"

[Verse 2]
I see the games a mile away
They only end when another heart breaks
But all of his wounds ain't an excuse
For you to put up with how he treats you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You're gonna give it all and give it all
But you won't get it back
I'm tellin' you, it's gonna hurt
Stay away from a boy like that

[Chorus]
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feelin' insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
Say, "He's never gonna know what to do
With a woman like you
With a woman like you"

[Bridge]
I can sleep at night
Knowing I really tried
I put in the time
But the fault isn't mine

[Chorus]
That he wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore (Anymore)
He wants a breadwinner
He wants your dinner
Until he ain't hungry anymore (Anymore)
He wants your shimmer
To make him feel bigger
Until he starts feelin' insecure
I wish somebody would've told me the truth
Say, "He's never gonna know what to do
[Outro]
With a woman like you
With a woman like you
With a woman like you and me"
He likes what he sees
