Plucked strings on porches, a poor boys' choir
And my blood's at a boil, there ain't no fire
I just love the way the light beams in
But I got bad news, I'm fearin' Friday again

[Verse 2]
Chokin' on some bourbon when you roll up
I said, "Boy, you gotta face it, you's ain't that tough"
There's a house hoppin' on the edge of town
I'm revved up, thirsty, and ready to drown

[Chorus]
I got a fear, dear, that it's gonna end
Won't you get angry at me, say you love me again?
I got a fear dear, that it's a Friday spark
You only love me like you mean it when it's after dark

[Verse 3]
We can hide out tonight out where thе trees get clear
Those plеase-you-eyes are a man's worst fear
There's a name saved on your heart's gravestone
Saturday's coming, I fear I'm wakin' alone

[Chorus]
I got a fear, dear, that it's gonna end
Won't you get angry at me, say you love me again?
I got a fear, dear, that it's a Friday spark
You only love me like you mean it when it's after dark
You might also like[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I got a fear, dear, that it's gonna end
Won't you get angry at me, say you love me again?
I got a fear, dear, that it's a Friday spark
You only love me like you mean it when it's after dark

[Outro]
Woo
Haha
Yeah
