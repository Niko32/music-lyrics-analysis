May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst the crash of the world

[Verse 1]
Did I hear a thunder?
Did I hear you pray?
I can't quite remember
Just what guided me this way, oh, oh

[Chorus]
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst the crash of the world

[Verse 2]
The pines, they often whisper
They whisper what no tongue can tell
He who drinks from the deep water (Ooh, ooh)
May he know the depths of the well (Ooh, ooh)
Well

[Chorus]
May I stand unshaken (May I)
Amid, amidst the crash of the world (Mmm)
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst the crash of the world
You might also like[Verse 3]
Mmm, oh, traveler
What have you seen?
Were there crossroads
Where you been, where you been?
I once was standing tall
Now I feel my back's against the wall

[Chorus]
May I stand unshaken (Oh)
Amid, amidst the crash of the world
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst the crash of the world
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 4]
The morning light when it comes to me
It was there, but I could not see
Am I to wander as a wayward son?
Will the hunter be hunted by the smoking gun? (Oh)

[Outro]
May I stand unshaken
Amid, amidst the crash of the world (World)
May I stand unshaken (May I)
Amid, amidst the crash of the world (World)
May I stand unshaken (May I)
Amid, amidst the crash of the world
