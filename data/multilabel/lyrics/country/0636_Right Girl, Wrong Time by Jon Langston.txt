She talked with a drawl
Had me wrapped around her pretty little finger
Her eyes caught mine
Pulled me in like the tide; hook, line and sinker
I was hung up on her kiss
'Bout as good as it gets

[Chorus]
'Cause she was the right girl
Yeah, she was all mine
Thought about her all day
We spent every night
Chasin' down the stars
Talkin' 'bout forever
But I learned the hard way
Never say never
It's too bad that clocks can't
Stop on a dime
'Cause she was the right girl
The right girl at the wrong time

[Verse 2]
Things can't stay the same
When we got a couple hundred miles between each other
Different states, we ain't
We ain't never been good at bein' long-distance lovers
I guess it is what it is
And that's the heartbreak I still can't forget
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause she was the right girl
Yeah, she was all mine
Thought about her all day
We spent every night
Chasin' down the stars
Talkin' 'bout forever
But I learned the hard way
Never say never
It's too bad that clocks can't
Stop on a dime
'Cause she was the right girl
The right girl at the wrong time

[Bridge]
If two hearts were meant to be, they'll find their way I guess
But when goodbye started, man, I was a mess

[Chorus]
She was the right girl
Yeah, she was all mine
Thought about her all day
We spent every night
Chasin' down the stars
Talkin' 'bout forever
And I learned the hard way
Never say never
It's too bad that clocks can't
Stop on a dime
'Cause she was the right girl
The right girl, at the wrong time
