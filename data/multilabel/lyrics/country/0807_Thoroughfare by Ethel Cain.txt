You fell in love with America when you were twelve years old
And by seventeen, you knew you had to see it all
You loved your dad and the love he had for your mother, so
You had to get out and go chasin' its sweet call

[Verse 2]
I met you there in Texas somewhere on the thoroughfare
On the side of the road in some torn-up clothes with a pistol in my pocket
I didn't trust no one, but you said, "Baby, don't run, I'll take you anywhere"
So I hopped right in, outta luck to spend, and at least your truck beats walking

[Chorus]
And you said, "Hey, do you wanna see thе west with me?
'Cause lovе's out there and I can't leave it be"
And I said, "Honey, love's never meant much to me
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need"

[Verse 3]
So we made off for California
To find your lover, drivin' day and night
And every small town diner
Saw our faces at least once or twice
But in these motel rooms
I started to see you differently, oh
'Cause for the first time since I was a child
I could see a man who wasn't angry
You might also like[Verse 4]
And he said, "It's been a long damn time since I left Florida
No one left to leave and no one left to love
But now that I met you, I finally know just where I'm headin'"
And we found heaven in time where your western sunshine
Met my deep southern wet
And you got lost in it and yet you found yourself
Hard-pressed for air and sweatin'

[Chorus]
And you said, "Hey, do you wanna see the west with me?
(Do you wanna see the west with me?)
'Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be"
(I can't leave it, I can't leave it)
And I said, "Honey, love's never meant that much to me
(Nothing much)
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need"

[Bridge]
And once we reached the coast, you said, "End of the line
We finally reached the edge after all this time
I didn't find my love, but I still made it this far without it"
And then you turned to me and stared into me deep
And said, "Well, maybe not 'cause look at what I've got
You might not be my love, but, baby, I doubt it"
[Chorus]
And you said, "Hey, do you wanna see the west with me?
'Cause love's out there and I can't leave it be"
(I can't leave it, I can't leave it)
And I said, "Honey, love's never meant that much to me
But I'll come with you if you're sure it's what you need"

[Outro]
'Cause in your pickup truck with all of your dumb luck is the only place I think I'd ever wanna be
