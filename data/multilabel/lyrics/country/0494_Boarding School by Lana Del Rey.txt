Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

[Verse 1]
L-L-Let's do drugs
Make love with our teachers
Come on, date a townie
Let his tattoo'd ass beat ya
I'm a fan of pro-ana nation
I do them drugs to stop the f-food cravings
If you wanna get high with me
I'm in the back doin' crack, drinkin' p-p-pepsi

[Chorus]
Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

Cheap trailer trash and everyone knows it
But she got a great ass and she knows how to show it
With American flags on each little finger
You're crashing on Wall Street
While I'm blowing up as a singer

[Verse 3]
If you wanna get that scholarship
Yale's not a problem, let's solve it
Educated in the language of doin' it
Get down like your tutor taught you to
And do it

[Chorus]
Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

[Verse 4]
If you wanna get that sugar cane
If you wanna be that pin-up queen
You can, you can
If you wanna do that south beach swing
Or go on a groove, vacationing
You can, you can, you can
[Bridge]
When they said prolific, they weren't kidding
You thought that I was just a calender kitten
But now you heard me purring, tiger, you're smitten
So let's begin to major in the art of sinnin'

[Chorus]
Everyone from home
Says that you're so cool
Come on, everybody
To the boarding school
Everyone from town
Says that you're so cool
Come on, get down
To the boarding school

[Outro]
Get down, get down
