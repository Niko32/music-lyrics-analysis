Why are there so many
Songs about rainbows
And what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions
But only illusions
And rainbows have nothing to hide
So we've been told and some choose to believe it
I know they're wrong wait and see

[Hook]
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me

[Verse 2]
Who said that every wish
Would be heard and answered
When wished on the morning star?
Somebody thought of that
And someone believed it
Look what it's done so far
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing
And what do we think we might see?

[Hook]
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
You might also like[Bridge]
All of us under its spell
We know that it's probably magic

[Verse 3]
Have you been half asleep
And have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name
Is this the sweet sound
That calls the young sailors?
The voice might be one and the same
I've heard it too many times to ignore it:
It's something that I'm supposed to be

[Hook]
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection
The lovers, the dreamers and me
Da-da-da-dee-da-da dum
Da-da-da-da-dee-da-da-doo
