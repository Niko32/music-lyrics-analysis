Early in the mornin' when the sun does rise
Layin' in the bed with bloodshot eyes
Late in the evenin' when the sun sinks low
That's about time my rooster crows
I got women up and down this creek
And they keep me goin' and my engine clean
Run me ragged but I don't fret
'Cause there ain't been one slow me down, none yet

[Chorus]
Get me drinkin' that moonshine
Get me higher than the grocery bill
Take my troubles to the high-wall
Throw 'em in the river and get your fill
We've been sniffin' that cocaine
Ain't nothin' better when the wind cuts cold
Lord, it's a mighty hard livin'
But a damn good feelin' to run these roads

[Verse 2]
I got people try to tell me, Red
Keep this livin' and you'll wind up dead
Cast your troubles on the Lord of lords
Or wind up layin' on a coolin' board
But I got buddies up White House Road
And they keep me strutting when my feet hang low
Rotgut whiskey gonna ease my pain
An' all this runnin's gonna keep me sane
You might also like[Chorus]
Get me drinkin' that moonshine
Get me higher than the grocery bill
Take my troubles to the high-wall
Throw 'em in the river and get your fill
We've been sniffin' that cocaine
Ain't nothin' better when the wind cuts cold
Lord it's a mighty hard livin'
But a damn good feelin' to run these roads
It's a damn good feelin' to run these roads

[Verse 3]
When you lay me in the cold hard clay
Won't you sing them hymns while the banjo plays?
You can tell them ladies that they ought not frown
'Cause there ain't been nothin' ever held me down

[Pre-Chorus]
Lawmen, women or a shallow grave
Same ol' blues just a different day

[Chorus]
Get me drinkin' that moonshine
Get me higher than the grocery bill
Take my troubles to the high-wall
Throw 'em in the river and get your fill
We've been sniffin' that cocaine
Ain't nothin' better when the wind cuts cold
Lord it's a mighty hard livin'
But a damn good feelin' to run these roads
It's a damn good feelin' to run these roads
It's a damn good feelin' to run these roads
