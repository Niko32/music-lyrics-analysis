Uh-oh, ye-ah, uh-oh, ye-ah-oh
Uh-oh, ye-ah, uh-oh

[Verse 1]
I wear women's underwear
And then I go to strike a pose in my full-length mirror
I cross my legs just like a queer
But my libido is strong when a lady is near, yeah
What defines a straight man's straight?
Is it the boxer in the brief or a twelve-ounce steak?
Nah, I'll tell you what a woman loves most
It's a man you can slap but can also stroke

[Chorus]
Going in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's naked
It's verbatim and it's shakin'
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No more getting elated
No more listless invitations

[Post-Chorus]
UGH!

[Verse 2]
I live by a hospital
And every day, I go out walking past its sickly windows
I see people dying there
But my tender age makes it hard to care
The incinerator and a big smokestack
It's a phallic symbol and it makes me laugh (Ha)
All I need is a heart attack, c'mon
Humble my bones with a cardiac (Humble my bones with a cardiac)
You might also like[Chorus]
Going in the wind is an eddy of the truth and it's naked
It's verbatim and it's shakin'
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
No more getting elated
No more listless invitations

[Bridge]
For the love of fuck (Love of fuck)
For the sake of Pete (Sake of Pete)
Did you ever really think you'd love (Ever really think you'd love)
A guy like me? (A guy like me?)
I am the rooster in the morning (Rooster in the morning)
I'm the cock of the day (Cock of the day)
I'm the boxer in the briefs (Boxer in the briefs)
I'm a twelve-ounce steak (Twelve-ounce steak)

[Bridge]
Eh-oh, eh-oh
Eh-oh, eh-oh
Yabo, yabo
Yabo, yabo
Yabo
It's verbatim
And yeah, and it's naked
And yeah, and it's shakin'
It shakes, shakes, shakes
[Outro]
Uh-oh, ye-ah, uh-oh, ye-ah-oh
Uh-oh, ye-ah, uh-oh, ye-ah-oh
Uh-oh, ye-ah, uh-oh, ye-ah-oh
Uh-oh, ye-ah
