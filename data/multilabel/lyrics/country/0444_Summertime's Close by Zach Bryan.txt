Well, I've had cold and humid mornings on city streets and back porches
But I ain’t never breathed a breath as fresh as you
And I've seen children playin' on the coastlines under the white lines, atop the blue tides
But I ain’t ever been baptized in water as cool as you

[Refrain]
And the law don't ever come back here and I reckon they don't try
I just put some beer on ice, let's just dance for a moment or two

[Chorus]
'Cause you're the fire of Carolina and Oklahoma too
The stars in San Luis ain't burnin' bright as you
You’rе the waves crashin’ down on the Eastеrn Coast
When the day's coolin’ off and the summertime's close
I lost faith in the world a long time ago

[Verse 2]
We'd always ride those back roads back when you got sick
Roll the windows down just for the hell of it
You always acted baptized every time we hit the coast
Bandana tan line on your forehead, so the tourists didn't know

[Chorus]
You’re the fire of Carolina and Oklahoma too
And the stars in San Luis ain't burnin' bright as you
You're the waves crashin' down on the Eastern Coast
When the day's coolin' off and the summertime's close
I lost faith in the world a long time ago
My blood rushed to the heart, you were my last hope
You might also like[Refrain]
And the law don't ever come back here and I reckon they don't try
I just put some beer on ice and tonight I'm dancin' for two
