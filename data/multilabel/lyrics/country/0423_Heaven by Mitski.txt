All of our love
Filling all of our room
Your low, warm voice
Curses as you find the string
To strike within me
That rings out a note
Heard in heaven

Heaven

[Verse 2]
Now I bend like a willow
Thinkin' of you
Like a murmuring brook
Curving about you
As I sip on the rest of the coffee you left
A kiss left of you
You might also like[Chorus]

Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
Hear the storm
Dances outside
Something set free
Is runnin’ through the night
And the dark awaits us
All around the corner
But here in our place
We havе for the day
Can we stay awhile and listеn for
