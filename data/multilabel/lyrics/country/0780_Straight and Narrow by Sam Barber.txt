When there's a storm ragin' in your soul
You gotta thank God that you're still growin' old
If them demons you're fightin' won't go away
Drop on your knees and pray

[Chorus]
Life can get hard sometimes, I know
You gotta get up and walk the straight and narrow
When they're chasin' you down with an old bloodhound
And you're runnin' through the fields for your life
You gotta get up, son, I know they're gunnin' for ya

[Verse 2]
Don't let the thought of yesterday
Crowd out the visions of today
Don't let your past define your name
We will all be judged the same someday

[Chorus]
Life can get hard sometimes, I know
You gotta get up and walk the straight and narrow
When they're chasin' you down with an old bloodhound
And you're runnin' through the fields for your life
You gotta get up, son, I know they're gunnin' for ya
You might also like[Outro]
When they're chasin' you down with an old bloodhound
And you're runnin' through the fields for your life
You gotta get up, son, I know they're gunnin' for ya
