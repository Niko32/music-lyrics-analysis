The many miles we walked
The many things we learned
The building of a shrine
Only just to burn
May the wind be at your back
Good fortune touch your hand
May the cards lay out a straight
All from your command

[Chorus]
That's the way it is
That’s the way it is
That's the way it is
That's the way it is

[Verse 2]
Blue heron leaves the northern sky
Trusts the journey to new heights
What’s the meaning of the scar
If we don't know how to heal
Should we ever be apart
Then how does it feel

[Chorus]
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
That's the way it is
You might also like[Bridge]
Shine light into darkness
Shine light into darkness

[Chorus]
That's the way it is
That's the way it is (So many miles to walk)
That’s the way it is (So many things we’ve got to learn)
That's the way it is (Oh, that’s the way it is)
That's the way it is (Oh)
That's the way it is
