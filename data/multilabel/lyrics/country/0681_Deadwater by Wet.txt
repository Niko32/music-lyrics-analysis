If I could be stronger
And if you were just older
We might last this out longer
But the task just gets harder
And my face turned to red
From drinking all that dead water
And then again when you said
That I was my mother's daughter

[Chorus]
Shaky when he comes to me
Shaky but I believe
Shaky and I'm on my knees
There are better things for me
Shaky when I came to be
When they left, they left me in pieces
Shaky, but I believe
There are better things for me

[Verse 2]
If my legs were longer
They might carry us further
But we waited too long
And so the task just gets harder
And the thoughts that come in
They come on stronger and stronger
And it takes all of me
To just stay out of the water
You might also like[Chorus]
Shaky when he comes to me
Shaky but I believe
Shaky and I'm on my knees
There are better things for me
Shaky when I came to be
When they left, they left me in pieces
Shaky, but I believe
When you left, you left for a reason

[Bridge]
Ohhhh, take me to the things I see I see
My eyes can reach passed all that's been laid out for me

[Chorus]
Shaky when he comes to me
Shaky but I believe
Shaky and I'm on my knees
There are better things for me
Shaky when I came to be
When they left, they left me in pieces
Shaky, but I believe
There are better things for me
