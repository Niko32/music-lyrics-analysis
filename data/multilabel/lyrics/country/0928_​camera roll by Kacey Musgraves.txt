Don't go through your camera roll
So much you don't know that you've forgotten
What a trip, the way you can flip
Through all the good parts of it, I shouldn't have done it

[Chorus]
Chronological order and nothing but torture
Scroll too far back, that's what you get
I don't wanna see 'em, but I can't delete 'em
It just doesn't feel right yet, not yet

[Verse 2]
All the best, that's all that's left
Cruel evidence, it does me no favors
I should know it's a place not to go
When I'm alone, I'll just feel bad later

[Chorus]
Chronological order and nothing but torture
Scroll too far back, that's what you get
I don't wanna see 'em, but I can't delete 'em
It just doesn't feel right yet, not yet

[Bridge]
Hmm, look at me, I'm living all alone
And now you're only living in my phone
You might also like[Outro]
Anyway, thanks for all the nights and the days
And everything that you gave, I'll never erase it
There's one where we look so in love
Before we lost all the sun and I made you take it
