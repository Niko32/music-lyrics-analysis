[Intro]
I took that fella round back to the water hole
I took that fella round back to the water hole
I took that fella round back to the water hole
Yee-hah
It's me everybody howdy, Lil Darkie, with another Christian hit
(Yuh)

[Verse 1]
I took that fella round back to the water hole
I turn that critter to dust and it’s audible
I turn your 10-gallon hat to some particles
Can’t even read what they wrote in my articles
I’m so illiterate, I can’t even read a little bit
I keep a banjo my hip and I diddle it
Middle kid, I got some siblings
Rat eat the scrap on the floor and the niblings
I keep a bat I keep score in my backyard
My daddy fat and he poor it ain't that hard
My dad republican but he live on unemployment
Farming don’t bring no enjoyment
Kids in my town is afflicted with opiates
Heroin needles, addiction is copious
Never appropriate, uncle yelling 'bout the Soviets
Taking over his associates

I’ma country boy in my heart
I’ma country boy in these parts
I’ma country boy on my land
I’ma country boy I don’t bend
Uh, want some freedom I’ll deliver
Uh, out in Russia you might shiver
See the moonshine inside my liver
George shot Lenny by the river
(Uh)

[Verse 2]
Dipping tobacco inside of my lip again
Ripping the back off a pack and then stick it in
Spit it inside of a jar, get my nicotine
Get the fuck outta my town, man, I’m sick of them
Methamphetamine abusers
We the better men, they losers
The beggars cannot be the choosers
I be posted with my crackers
Some of us blacker but that ain't a factor
We packing that heat and it’s hotter than barbecue
I’m with my dogs, that’s Scooby Doo, Marmaduke
Put up a wall and I barb it too
That way it harming you
Hoppin' it that’s what that karma do
I conceal carry my .38 special
Especially for any devilish vessels
My rifle don’t trifle on who in its sights
If he evil my Deagle be taking his life
And that eagle I keep on my Jeep and my Chevy
It fill up my heart till a part of me heavy
The levies they creaking, the plains and the peaks
And the valleys from Georgia, to Cali I’m seeking
For destiny manifest, definitely can attest
I despise everyone, anyone’s ran against
One reason or another
Whether northerner or southern
I prefer less stubbornness inside the governance
I want my vote to feel less like another miss
And like they thinking 'bout us normal citizens
I wonder if there’s any time to fit us in
Too busy banning self-defence, everybody’s tense
None of these liberals are making any sense
Now there’s some nazi’s that took up residence
Voted for Donny and I’m still scared of Pence
What the fuck is the whole country coming to?
Rappers and Muslims is dying and gunning too
Police get shot and they doin' the killing
Put end to this shit God willing
All of the innocent blood we spilling
Everyone gun on yo' arm, no kneeling now
Here, pop a pill if it’s tearing you down
Welcome to new America town!
[Part II]

[Refrain]
Yee-haw
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

[Chorus]
Stepping on my land?
Then you gonna catch the weapon (Yee-haw)
What you catching? Lead from a Smith and Wesson (Alright)
I'm in the field at 4 o'clock so why you pressing?

[Verse 3]
“City folk, city folk, we don't like you city folk”
Pull up to my farm, and I'ma harm you, let the .50 poke
Redneck man, touch my daughter I'ma slaughter you
Caught her by the water with a commie
So I shot her too, Waterloo
South Carolina and Nevada too
Proud to be American it, isn’t getting hotter dude
It isn’t getting hotter, I'm a martyr, I'm a patriot
Pull up in a Ford, with the rifle, man, he ate the shit
Pull up on the tractor, with my pastor, you an atheist
We don't need guns! On the web? You the laziest
Craziest, to think you can stop me, popping these enemies
And I ain't stopping the dropping 'til I get ten at least (Drop 'em)
I tow magnums, drink Jack Daniels, not Hennessey (Shot it)
Dragon’s breath in my weapon, get them from Tennessee (Pop it)
I could bury you, open carry the remedy (Shot it)
Whipping out my property stop like Kennedy (Shot it)
Home of watching Fox News like it’s the fucking playoffs
All these politicians smoking crack rock and getting payoffs
Taxpaying, track laying
Hopping out the back spraying
I'm voting, Nine toting
Won the war and I'm gloating
Beer drinking, clear thinking
'Merican man at the beach
A seagull is wearing a can
[Chorus]
Stepping on my land
Then you gonna catch the weapon (Yee-haw)
What you catching? Lead from a Smith and Wesson (Alright)

[Refrain]
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
1-2-3

[Chorus]
Stepping on my land
Then you gonna catch the weapon (Yee-haw)
What you catching? Lead from a Smith and Wesson (Alright)
I'm in the field at 4 o'clock so why you pressing (Yee-haw)
Pressing on me I'ma teach your boys a lesson

[Outro]
Yippee-ki-yay motherfucker!
Yuh, yuh
I took that fella round back to the water hole
I turn that critter to dust and it’s audible
I turn your 10-gallon hat to some particles
Can’t even read what they wrote in my-
