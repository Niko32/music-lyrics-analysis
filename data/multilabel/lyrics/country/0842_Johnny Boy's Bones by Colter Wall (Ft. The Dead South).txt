Well, I wish I was in the land of cotton
Old times, they are not forgotten
Look away, look away, look away
Dixieland

[Verse 1]
Oh, musket and cannon have torn his gray coat
Don't he look fine and handsome?
Don't he look at his most?
For he fought in the foxholes and at this, I will boast
Don't they look fine and handsome?
My poor Johnny Boy's bones

[Chorus]
Well, who will bring back my Johnny Boy's bones
To lay beneath the trees of his Tennessee home
A box, a box made of sturdy white oak
With his arms folded up and his blue eyes all closed

[Verse 2]
Well he died for his country and he died for his kin
And he died killing men, a most honorable sin
But them mean boys in blue, they done turned him in
When they laid him low with a laugh and a grin
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, who will bring back my Johnny Boy's bones
To lay 'neath the trees of our Tennessee home
A box, a box made of sturdy white oak
With his arms folded up and his blue eyes all closed

Oh, who will bring back my Johnny Boy's bones
To lay 'neath the trees of our Tennessee home
A box, a box made of sturdy white oak
With his arms folded up and his blue eyes all closed

Oh, who will bring back my Johnny Boy's bones
To lay 'neath the trees of our Tennessee home
A box, a box made from sturdy white oak
With his arms folded up and his blue eyes all closed
