I'm not mad at you anymore
I just watch and think: "disappointed me"
And i get further away from you
Because i don’t want to suffer anymore, i want to be happy
Your love is poison and more
And i feel a pain, in my soul, but with calm
I open my phone
And see you were with another
How i feel

[Pre-Chorus: Pedro Tovar & DannyLux]
I call you to confirm
But you don’t want to answer, you kill me
I don’t know what was the reason
If i was giving you, all of my love, I'm destroyed

[Chorus: Pedro Tovar & DannyLux]
I had faith in you, but you played and i suffered
I'm actually doing bad, here I am in my loneliness
I never lied to you, you were my whole world
And the truth is, you left me at zero
All of my love and my bеing, i gave you everything, why?

[Interlude: Pedro Tovar & DannyLux]
Thеre you go little girl
Or not? My friend Danny
Mate Pedro

My heart isn’t the same anymore
A wound that is fatal
I will not love again
I cry when it rains
Cause when i do, no one can hear me
I drown in my tears

[Chorus: DannyLux & Pedro Tovar]
I don’t feel better, but the body gets used to it
With a bottle or with two, with that i forget you
And now i say goodbye, I wasted my time with you
I see a future, but its not you and me
All of my love and my being, i gave you everything, why?
