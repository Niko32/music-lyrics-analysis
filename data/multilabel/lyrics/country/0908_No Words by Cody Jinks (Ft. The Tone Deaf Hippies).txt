My whole view of the word has changed
I guess that comes with age
I don't believe there's good in every man
Like I did back then

[Verse 2]
I may drink more than I should
You've seen me on the floor
I've spent my lifetime in this cage I built around me
Bangin' on the door

[Chorus]
And no words
Could ever say how much I need you
With you here
You make this life I lead worth living

[Verse 3]
Heaven knows I broke your heart
I can't take that away
All I'm worth is just this promise that I've made to you
To stand beside you just like you have stood beside me

[Chorus]
And no words
Could ever say how much I need you
With you here
You make this life I lead worth living
You might also like[Bridge]
You could be much better off
God knows, without me
And that's why
I just can't find the words

[Outro]
You could be much better off
God Knows without me
And that's why
I just can't find the words
