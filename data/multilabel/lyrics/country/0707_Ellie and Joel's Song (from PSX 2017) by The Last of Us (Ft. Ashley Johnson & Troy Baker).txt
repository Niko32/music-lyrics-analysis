I'm just a poor, wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world of woes
There is no sickness, no toil, nor danger
In that bright light to which I go
[Pre-Chorus 1: Ashley Johnson]
I'm going there to see my mother
She said she'd meet me when I come

[Chorus: Ashley Johnson]
I'm just a-goin' over Jordan
I'm just a-goin' over home

[Verse 2: Ashley Johnson]
I know dark clouds will gather 'round me
I know my way is rough and steep
But beauteous fields lie just before me
Where gods redeemed their vigils keep
[Pre-Chorus 2: Ashley Johnson]
I'm going there to see my father
I'm going there, no more to roam

[Chorus: Ashley Johnson]
I'm just a-goin' over Jordan
I'm just a-goin' over home

I'll soon be free from earthly trials
This body rests in the old churchyard
I'll drop this cross of self-denial
And go singing home to God

[Pre-Chorus 3: Troy Baker]
I'm going there to see my savior
I'm going there, no more to roam

[Chorus: Troy Baker with Ashley Johnson]
I'm just a-goin' over Jordan
I'm just a-goin' over home
I'm just a-goin' over Jordan
I'm just a-goin over home
[Outro: Troy Baker]
I'm just a-goin'
