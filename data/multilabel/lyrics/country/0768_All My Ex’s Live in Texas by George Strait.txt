All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

[Verse 1]
Rosanna's down in Texarkana
Wanted me to push her broom
And sweet Eileen's in Abilene
She forgot I hung the moon
And Allison's in Galveston
Somehow lost her sanity
And Dimples, who now lives in Temple's
Got the law looking for me

[Chorus]
All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
And that's why I hang my hat in Tennessee

[Verse 2]
I remember that old Frio River
Where I learned to swim
But it brings to mind another time
Where I wore my welcome thin
By transcendental meditation
I go there each night
But I always come back to myself
Long before daylight
You might also like[Chorus]
All my exes live in Texas
And Texas is the place I'd dearly love to be
But all my exes live in Texas
Therefore I reside in Tennessee

[Outro]
Some folks think I'm hiding
It's been rumored that I died
But I'm alive and well in Tennessee
