They're going real fast and real left, son
They're going fast and left
Fuck yeah, woohoo

[Verse 1]
Hey there, darlin', won't you love me down?
I'm fifty one miles out in interstate town
I just decided I ain't keepin' quiet and I'm free
I lost my family to a bad disease
I got a mean, mean gene in my family tree
That grows in grandfather, and his daughters, and me, you see?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I wanna stay humble, I wanna stay hungry
I wanna hear my father say that he loves me
I never gave a shit about being arrogant anyway

[Chorus]
So hold on tight
'Cause I'll be working ovеrtime
They told me that I couldn't and I shouldn't еven try
Ever since I was child, been workin' for a while, overtime

[Verse 2]
They said I's a wanna-be cowboy from a cut throat town
With tattooed skin and nobody around
"Your songs sound the same, you'll never make a name for yourself"
But I been scrapin' by my whole damn life
And granddaddy worked a double 'til the day he died
Said, "Never let this worlds earthly pride get you down"
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
No matter who you know, no matter what you do
I'll become what I deserve when it's all through
And you'll be there asking yourself why

[Chorus]
So hold on tight
'Cause I'll be working overtime
They told me that I couldn't and I shouldn't even try
Ever since I was child, been workin' for a while, overtime
