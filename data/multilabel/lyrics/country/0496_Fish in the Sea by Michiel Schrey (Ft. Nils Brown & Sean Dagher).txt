Come all you young sailor men, listen to me
I'll sing you a song of the fish in the sea:

[Chorus]
And it's windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows, we're all together, boys;
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes

[Verse 2]
Up jumps the eel with his slippery tail
Climbs up aloft and reefs the topsail

[Chorus]
And it's windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows, we're all together, boys;
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes

[Verse 3]
Then up jumps the shark with his nine rows of teeth
Saying, "You eat the dough boys, and I'll eat the beef!"

[Chorus]
And it's windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows, we're all together, boys;
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes
You might also like[Verse 4]
Up jumps the whale, the largest of all
"If you want any wind, well, I'll blow ye a squall!"

[Chorus]
And it's windy weather, boys, stormy weather, boys
When the wind blows, we're all together, boys;
Blow ye winds westerly, blow ye winds, blow
Jolly sou'wester, boys, steady she goes
