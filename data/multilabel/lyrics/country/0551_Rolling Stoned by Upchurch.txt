Church

[Verse 1]
Sometimes I get stoned in my backyard
Lay off in the tall grass, so my view is of stars
I think about nothin', get to clear my thoughts
From all the thunder and lightnin' so I feel a spark
Sometimes I get higher than the Colorado Rockies
Hopin' that the county sheriff don't stop me
Like Charlie Daniels said, you shouldn't smoke that dope
But damn it I can't help, I love rollin' stoned

[Chorus]
With the windows rolled down and the radio up
Sweet tea full in my Solo cup
Listenin' to the hummin' of the 44's
Soundin' like a concert out my beat up doors
Arm hangin' out the window, smile and a wave
Smokin' on some grown where the cattle graze
Charlie Daniels said you shouldn't go smoke that dope
But, hell, I can't help I love rollin' stoned
Yeah, I love rollin' stoned

[Verse 2]
Smoke rollin' 'round the cab with the dome light on
Lookin' like a stage for a Lynyrd Skynyrd song
Hangin' out with Mary Jane but she's makin' the time go slow
Makin' memories with my buddies through the thick green smoke
Puff passin' out the windows of my old Tahoe
Lifted so damn high I can't come down
Drivin' under the speed limit in my town
You might also like[Chorus]
With the windows rolled down and the radio up
Sweet tea full in my Solo cup
Listenin' to the hummin' of the 44's
Soundin' like a concert out my beat up doors
Arm hangin' out the window, smile and a wave
Smokin' on some grown where the cattle graze
Charlie Daniels said you shouldn't go smoke that dope
But hell, I can't help, I love rollin' stoned
Yeah, I love rollin' stoned

[Bridge]
There ain't nothin' like the swayin' of a windy back road
Baked out like a barn full of tobacco
I know Jesus drank wine but I bet he wouldn't mind
Sittin' with me in my Chevy pass it around a few times

[Chorus]
With the windows rolled down, the radio up
Sweet tea full in our Solo cups
Listenin' to the hummin' of the 44's
Like a concert out my beat up doors
Arm hangin' out the window, smile and a wave
Smokin' on some grown where the cattle graze
Ol' Willie said there's not nothin' wrong with smokin' dope
So light one up and let's go rollin' stoned
So pass me that and let's start rollin' stoned
