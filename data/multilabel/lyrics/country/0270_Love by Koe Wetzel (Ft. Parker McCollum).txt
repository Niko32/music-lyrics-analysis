To say I've been missin' you
Is the worst thing possible, that I could never do
And to sleep one more night next to you
Should be out of the question
Don't ask me no questions, like
If I love you, because I don't

[Chorus: Koe Wetzel]
I don't love you
The selfish don't love nobody
And I can't love you
Like you should be loved

[Verse 2: Koe Wetzel]
Don't talk crazy
Killin' yourself won't change a goddamn thing
If it's help that you need
Well, I know a place down the street

[Verse 3: Koe Wetzel]
And the storm's movin' in
It's been rainin' for five full days
And I know now's not the best time
But I've just gotta say, that I don't, I don't
You might also like[Chorus: Koe Wetzel]
I don't love you
The selfish don't love nobody
And I can't love you
Like you should be loved

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 4: Parker McCollum]
Was it an accident
When a broken heart and a bullet mark is all that she left?
To ask if I give a damn, should be out of the question
Don't ask me no questions, 'cause

[Chorus: Koe Wetzel & Both]
I don't love you
The selfish don't love nobody
And I can't love you
Like you should be loved
I don't love you
The selfish don't love nobody, yeah
