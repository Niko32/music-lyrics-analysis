I'm for law and order
The way that it should be
This song's about the night they spent
Protecting you from me
Someone called us outlaws
In some old magazine
New York sent a posse down
Like I ain't never seen

[Chorus]
Don't you think this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand?
What started out to be a joke
The law don't understand
Was it singing through my nose
That got me busted by the man?
This ain't it, this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand
Out of hand
Out of hand

[Verse 2]
We were wrapped up in the music
That's why we never saw
The cars pull up, the boys get out
And the room fill up with law
They came pounding through the back door
In the middle of my song
They got me for possession
Of something that was long gone
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't you think this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand?
What started out to be a joke
The law don't understand
Was it singing through my nose
That got me busted by the man?
This ain't it, this outlaw shit
Has gotten out of hand
Out of hand
Out of hand
