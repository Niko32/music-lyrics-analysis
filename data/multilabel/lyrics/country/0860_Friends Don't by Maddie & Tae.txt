They don't cancel other plans
Have conversations with nothin' but their eyes
They don't hear each other's names and forget to concentrate
Hits a nerve and lights you up like dynamite

[Chorus: Both, Maddie, Tae]
Friends don't call you in the middle of the night
Couldn't even tell you why
They just felt like saying, "Hi"
Friends don't stand around, playing with their keys
Finding reasons not to leave
Tryna hide the chemistry
Drive a little too slow (Slow)
Take the long way home (Home)
Get a little too close (Close)
We do but, but friends don't

[Verse 2: Both, Maddie]
They don't almost say, "I love you"
When they're downtown somewhere, just a little drunk
They don't talk about the future and put each other in it
And get chills with every accidental touch

[Chorus: Both, Maddie, Tae]
Friends don't call you in the middle of the night
Couldn't even tell you why
They just felt like saying, "Hi"
Friends don't stand around, playing with their keys
Finding reasons not to leave
Trying to hide the chemistry
Drive a little too slow (Slow)
Take the long way home (Home)
Get a little too close (Close)
We do but, but friends don't
You might also like[Bridge: Maddie, Tae, Both]
I keep telling myself this might be nothing (This might be nothing)
But one look in your eyes and, God, there's something (There's something)
You can lie to me and say you don't
But I know you do, and I love you too

[Chorus: Both, Maddie, Tae]
Friends don't call you in the middle of the night
Couldn't even tell you why
They just felt like saying, "Hi"
Friends don't stand around, playing with their keys
Finding reasons not to leave
Tryna hide the chemistry
Drive a little too slow (Slow)
Take the long way home (Home)
Get a little too close (Close)
We do but, but friends don't

[Outro: Both]
Friends don't
