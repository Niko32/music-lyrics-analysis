No one on this side of town
Knows a good place for a boy to drown
They look at me so strange when I talk
I wish I was a tradesman
Learnin' from some beat down old layman
On some hillside they ain't named yet
Sleepin' next to mountain fire smoke

[Verse 2]
And everyone lately's scarin' me
It's all backdoor deals and therapy
The only callous I've grown is in my mind
I wish I was a tradesman
Playin' with some tuned up tired string band
Somewhere out by the badlands
Way past closin' time

[Chorus]
So if you wanna trade, I'd say it's a hard earned mile
Wanna sweat likе hell, throw a hammer down
And know the old feelin' of a fivе o'clock smile
And know I didn't take no easy way out

[Verse 3]
There's somethin' more that I need
Than accolades and sympathy
Fatiguin' in the summer heat
While they smoke big cigars
So give me somethin' I can't fake
That rich boys can't manipulate
Somethin' real that they can't take
'Cause, Lord, I'm not your star
You might also like[Chorus]
If you wanna trade, I'd say it's a hard earned mile
Wanna sweat like hell, throw a hammer down
And know the old feelin' of a five o'clock smile
And know I didn't take no easy way out

[Outro]
Everyone lately's scarin' me
It's all backdoor deals and therapy
The only callous I've grown is in my mind
