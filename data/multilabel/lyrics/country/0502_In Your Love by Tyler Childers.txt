I will wait for you
'Til the sun turns into ashes
And bows down to the moon
I will wait for you
It's a long hard war
Ah, but I can grin and bear it
'Cause I know what the hell I'm fightin' for
And I will wait for you

[Chorus]
We were never made to run forever
We were just meant to go long enough
To find what we were chasin' after
I believe I found it here
In your love

[Verse 2]
I will stand my ground
I'm a bad man looking for takers
You're the finest thing around
So I will stand my ground
'Cause it's cold out there
And you know some men search for ages
For the love that I have found
So I will stand my ground
You might also like[Chorus]
We were never made to run forever
We were just meant to go long enough
To find what we were chasin' after
I believe I found it here
In your love

[Bridge]
Honey, I will wait for you
Honey, I will stand my ground

[Verse 3]
I will work for you
'Til my hands are tired and bleedin'
I know what it is from us I'm needin'
I will work for you
Like a team of mules
Pullin' Hell off from its hinges
It's the love that I'll keep tendin'
I will work for you

[Chorus]
We were never made to run forever
We were just meant to go long enough
To find what we were chasin' after
I believe I found it here
In your love
[Outro]
Honey, I will wait for you
Honey, I will stand my ground
I will work for you
I will stand my ground
