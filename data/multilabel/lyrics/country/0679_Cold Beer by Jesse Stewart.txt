I kinda get broken when it comes to emotion
Makes me start choking, so I sit by the ocean
I spent my last buck on a bottle of whiskey
Drunk and broke, sittin' here in history
I made my mind up, how I'm going
Got nowhere to go
Don't know where I'm going
I do know one thing, one thing that is true
Wherever I go, I'm gonna need you
We just can't let each other go now
We're too close, to ever slow down
The only one who keeps my chin up
When you touch my lips, we're like two dogs stuck

[Chorus]
Cold, cold beer
Don't you ever worry, I am right here
Never live without you
Don't care what I amount to no
Talkin' bout cold, cold beer
Don't you ever worry I'm right here
I could never live without you

[Verse 2]
I pick you up, I take you home
Sit on my couch, turn off my phone
'Cause I love your taste, love your smell
Who'd have ever thought that we could do so well?
Hell, I guess we're meant for each other
Sort'a like the microphone and my buddy Bruce Buffer
I can't really express my joy
Sorta like a scrap between Osgood and Patty Roy
I can't take my eyes off you
Went to rehab, thought that I lost you
But now we're back together, with a vengeance
Must be my little Irish descendance
It feels pretty good to get this off my chest
Even though people sayin' Jesse's obsessed
Well maybe I am, maybe they're right
One thing that I know, it was love at first sight
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah cold, cold beer
Don't you ever worry, I am right here
I could never live without you
I wouldn't even want to
Cold, cold beer
Don't you ever worry I am right here
Never live without you
You don't care what I amount to

[Verse 3]
Well I'm sittin' on my stoop feeling kinda lonely
Me and Brenda fightin' so I called up the homies
But the b'ys are busy hangin' out, in front of Sobeys
There's only one little feller, who really knows me
He comes in a little brown bottle or can
Sits in my hand 'til I can barely stand
He's part of the fam, he's part of the team
Took me under his wing when I was just a teen
Every time he comes around it always
Takes me back to when I had a fake ID, and a little dirt 'stache
Get a road soak, cold pop, two-four, wob pop, pop top, twist top, tall boy, cold shot

[Chorus]
Beer! Cold beer
Don't you ever worry, I am right here
I could never live without you
You don't care what I amount to
Cold, cold beer
Don't you ever worry, I am right here
I couldn't fuckin live without you
I wouldn't even want to
