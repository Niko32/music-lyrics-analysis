Hey, Miley
It's me, I’m in Nashville
I'm on my way to Dollywood, busy as you are
Can't, can’t get enough stuff to do, can we?
But, anyway, I'm excited about, uh, singing with you
So I'm just gonna turn my CD player on with you singing
I will put this on a cassette, sing along with it
Then I'll run you off a CD later
Oh, I'm so high tech, I got a flip phone too
But, anyhow, uh, see what you think
And, um, here I go
Come on

[Verse 1: Miley Cyrus & Dolly Parton]
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where everything goes as planned
And I smile
'Cause I know if we try
We could really make a difference in this world
I won't give up or sleep a wink
It’s the only thought I think
You know where I stand
I believe we can
Start livin’ in a rainbowland
You might also like[Chorus: Both, Miley Cyrus, Dolly Parton]
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I’d be lyin' (I'd be lyin')
If I said this was fine (This is not fine)
All the hurt and the hate going on here (It needs to stop here)
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let’s shine through (Through)
Together, we can
Start livin' in a rainbowland

[Verse 2: Both, Dolly Parton, Miley Cyrus]
Living in a rainbowland
Where skies are blue and things are grand
Wouldn't it be nice (So nice)
To live in paradise?
Where we're free to be exactly who we are
Let's all dig down deep inside
Brush the judgment and fear aside
Make wrong things right (Make things right)
And end the fight
'Cause I promise ain't nobody gonna win (Come on)

[Chorus: Both, Miley Cyrus, Dolly Parton]
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Oh, I'd be lyin' (I'd be lyin')
If I said this was fine (This is not fine)
All the hurt and the hate going on here (It needs to stop here)
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through (Through)
Together, we can
Start livin' in a rainbowland
[Bridge: Miley Cyrus]
Ooh
Ooh

[Chorus: Both, Miley Cyrus, Dolly Parton]
Livin' in a rainbowland
Where you and I go hand in hand
Together (Let's do it together)
Change things forever (Forever)
I know there's gotta be a greater plan
We are rainbows, me and you
Every color, every hue
Let's shine through (Take my hand)
Together, we can
Start livin' in a rainbowland

[Outro: Dolly Parton]
Hey, Miley
Look, I know it sounds scrambled when I'm singing it with you
But the talking could do a lot better
At least, I may not get it all the way through 'cause I'm not sure of the structure without you
But I think this could work well, don't you?
If not, like I said, I'll write that love song for you
You probably wrote it about some boy you loved, didn't ya?
Well
