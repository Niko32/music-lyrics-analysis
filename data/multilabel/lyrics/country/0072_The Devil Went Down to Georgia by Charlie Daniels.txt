The Devil went down to Georgia
He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump
And said "Boy, let me tell you what."

[Verse 2]
"I guess you didn't know it
But I'm a fiddle player too
And if you'd care to take a dare
I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you."
The boy said, "My name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been."

[Bridge]
Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul
You might also like[Verse 3]
The Devil opened up his case
And he said, "I'll start this show."
And fire flew from his fingertips
As he rosined up his bow
And he pulled the bow across the strings
And it made an evil hiss
And a band of demons joined in
And it sounded something like this:
[Demonic violin piece]

[Verse 3]
When the Devil finished, Johnny said
"Well, you're pretty good ol' son
But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done."

[Chorus]
"Fire on the Mountain" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, does your dog bite? No, child, no
[Non-demonic violin piece]
[Verse 4]
The Devil bowed his head
Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle
On the ground at Johnny's feet
Johnny said, "Devil, just come on back
If you ever wanna try again
I done told you once, you son of a bitch
I'm the best there's ever been."

[Chorus]
And he played "Fire on the Mountain" Run, boys, run!
The Devil's in the house of the rising sun
Chicken's in the bread pan picking out dough
Granny, will your dog bite? No, child, no
