I'm in love with Jesus Christ
He's so nice
I'm in love, I'll say it twice
I'm in love (I'm in love)

[Verse 2: Matthew Healy & Phoebe Bridgers]
I'm in love, but I'm feeling low
For I am just a footprint in the snow
I'm in love with a boy I know
But that's a feeling I can never show

[Chorus: Matthew Healy & Phoebe Bridgers]
Fortunately, I believe, lucky me
I'm searching for planes in the sea, and that's irony
Soil just needs water to be, and a seed
So if we turn into a tree, can I be the leaves?

[Post-Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers]
Ooh
Ooh

[Verse 3: Phoebe Bridgers]
I'm in love with the girl next door
Her name's Claire
Nice when she comes 'round to call
Then masturbate the second she's not there
You might also like[Chorus: Matthew Healy & Phoebe Bridgers]
Fortunately, I believe, lucky me
Searching for planes in the sea, and that's irony
Soil just needs water to be, and a seed
So if we turn into a tree, can I be the leaves?

[Post-Chorus: Phoebe Bridgers]
Ooh
Ooh
