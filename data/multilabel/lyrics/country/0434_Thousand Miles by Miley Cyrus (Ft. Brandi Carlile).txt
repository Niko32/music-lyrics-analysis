Amazing, I'm driving 'round town in a beat-up old Mercedes
You think I'm crazy, you might be right
But when he smiles, I don't care about the past
Just like that

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I told myself I closed that door
But I'm right back here again
I know half of what I'm saying don't make no sense
So don't ask me where I been
[Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I'm not always right, but still, I ain't got time for what went wrong
Where I end up, I don't really care
I'm out of my mind, but still, I'm holding on like a rolling stone
A thousand miles from anywhere

[Verse 2: Miley Cyrus & Brandi Carlile]
I look in the rearview, I was talking to you 'fore I realize it's madness
Before the sadness
Oh, I pick up the phone and I call back home, but all I get is a dial tone
And instead of hangin' up, I hang my head

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Brandi Carlile]
I told myself I closed that door
But I'm right back here again
I know half of what I'm saying don't make no sense
So don't ask me where I been
You might also like[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Brandi Carlile]
I'm not always right, but still, I ain't got time for what went wrong
Where I end up, I don't really care
I'm out of my mind, but still, I'm holding on like a rolling stone
A thousand miles from anywhere

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Pre-Chorus: Miley Cyrus]
I told myself I closed that door
But I'm right back here again
I know half of what I'm saying don't make no sense
So don't ask me where I been

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus & Brandi Carlile]
I'm not always right, but still, I ain't got time for what went wrong
Where I end up, I don't really care
I'm out of my mind, but still, I'm holding on like a rolling stone
A thousand miles from anywhere
