In constant sorrow through all his days

[Verse 1: Ulysses Everett McGill]
I am a man of constant sorrow
I've seen trouble all my days
I bid farewell to ol' Kentucky
The place where I was born and raised

[Delmar & Pete]
The place where he was born and raised

[Verse 2: Ulysses Everett McGill]
For six long years I've been in trouble
No pleasure here on Earth I've found
For in this world I'm bound to ramble
I have no friends to help me now

[Delmar & Pete]
He has no friends to help him now

[Verse 3: Ulysses Everett McGill]
It's fare thee well, my old true lover
I never expect to see you again
For I'm bound to ride that Northern Railroad
Perhaps I'll die upon this train
You might also like[Delmar & Pete]
Perhaps he'll die upon this train

[Verse 4: Ulysses Everett McGill]
You can bury me in some deep valley
For many years where I may lay
And you may learn to love another
While I am sleeping in my grave

[Delmar & Pete]
While he is sleeping in his grave

[Verse 5: Ulysses Everett McGill]
Maybe your friends think I'm just a stranger
My face you never will see no more
But there is one promise that is given
I'll meet you on God's golden shore

[Delmar & Pete]
He'll meet you on God's golden shore
