You see a girl in the hallway
And you whisper to your friend, "Who is she anyway?"
You forgot what she looks like in like a day
But your words don't hurt me
I will be okay

[Bridge]
'Cause you don't hurt me
I won't mold to...

[Chorus]
Your silly words
I won't live inside your world
Because your punches and your names
All your jokes and stupid games
They don't work
No they don't hurt
Watch them just go right through me
Because they mean nothing to me
I'm not Clay

[Verse 2]
You see that girl in the hallway
Smile on her face as she walks away
Trying to tear her down was your first mistake
'Cause little do you know she wasn't built to break
You might also like[Bridge]
'Cause you don't hurt me
I won't mold to...

[Chorus]
Your silly words
I won't live inside your world
Because your punches and your names
All your jokes and stupid games
They don't work
No they don't hurt
Watch them just go right through me
Because they mean nothing to me

[Bridge]
Try to change my shape
But, baby, I'm not Clay
Sorry not today
Because, baby, I'm not...
Try to change my shape
But, baby, I'm not Clay
Sorry not today
Because, baby, I'm not Clay

[Chorus]
Your silly words
I won't live inside your world
Because your punches and your names
All your jokes and stupid games
They don't work
No they don't hurt
Watch them just go right through me
Because they mean nothing to me
I'm not Clay
