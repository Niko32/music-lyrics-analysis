I remember tears streaming down your face when I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Joy Williams of The Civil Wars backup]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with John Paul White of The Civil Wars backup]
Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when (the) music's gone
Gone

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh
Oh

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Civil Wars]
Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Outro: Taylor Swift with The Civil Wars backup]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
