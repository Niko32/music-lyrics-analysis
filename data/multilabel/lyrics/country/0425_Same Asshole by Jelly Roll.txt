Forgive me I've been drinkin', backroadin' and thinkin'
Rememberin' the band played on while the ship sinkin'
No matter what I do there's no escapin' my past
I do everything I can and it keeps chasin' my ass
I know my karma is constant for all the hearts that I broke
Knowin' I'll never be forgiven, that shit bothers my soul
When it's thrown up in my face, man that shit fucks up my day
No matter what I do, I feel I'm only judged by mistakes
Even if the good outweighs it by a million to one
They still gon' hate me for the single fuckin' thing that I done
Even if the good outweighs it by a million to one
They still gon' hate me for that single fuckin' thing that I done (Thing that I done)

[Chorus]
I try not to think of hard times
I try hard to let the past go
I thank God that I'm a changed man
But somedays I'm that same asshole
The same old me, the same backroads
A couple of crosses and a black rose
Singin' the same old sad song

[Verse 2: Jelly Roll]
I must admit I'm infatuated with sad clowns
I guess they help me better understand my Dad now
Those that entertain at the expense of pain
Those that dance in the rain instead of just complain
My brother always said I was ahead of the game
Even before the fuckin' money hit, the jealousy came
Put it all on the line, there's no regrets in this shit
I admit besides the blessings there was lessons in it
They said life is a marathon, tighten up 'cause you gotta run
I know that the dollar spends as fast as the dollar comes
Why these other rap dudes in the strip club with a lot of ones?
I'm just tryin' to buy a crib and start my kids a college fund, for real
You might also like[Chorus]
I try not to think of hard times
I try hard to let the past go
I thank God that I'm a changed man
But somedays I'm that same asshole
The same old me, the same backroads
A couple of crosses and a black rose
Singin' the same old sad songs

[Verse 3: Jelly Roll]
Can I be real for a minute? Release this passion within
My fat ass gettin' bigger, I need to get back to the gym
I'm lookin' at myself like how the fuck this happened again?
Baby-Mama got out of jail and she done relapsed again
I swear I'm tellin y'all the truth, there's so much shit in the air
My father got leukemia, he just left critical care
Not to mention mama's got dementia, man, she's always feelin' sick
I try to help her pay the rent but she's unhappy as it gets
I cannot complain because my daughter's doin' great
Plus this music shit's a dream, what the fuck you think it ain't?
But please make no mistake, baby after the show
I'm all alone on this road headin' back to my home

[Chorus]
I try not to think of hard times
I try hard to let the past go
I thank God that I'm a changed man
But somedays I'm that same asshole
The same old me, the same backroads
A couple of crosses and a black rose
Singin' the same old sad songs
