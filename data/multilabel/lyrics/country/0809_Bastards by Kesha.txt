One, two, three, four, one

[Verse 1]
I got too many people (Da-da-da, da)
I got left to prove wrong
All those motherfuckers (Da-da-da, da)
Been too mean for too long
And I'm so sick of crying, yeah
Darlin’, what's it for?
I could fight forever, oh
But life's too short

[Chorus]
Don’t let the bastards get you down, oh, no
Don't let the assholes wear you out
Don't let the mean girls take the crown
Don't let the scumbags screw you 'round
Don't let the bastards take you down

[Verse 2]
Been underestimated my entire life
I know people gonna talk shit
And darlin', that's fine
But they won’t break my spirit
I won’t let 'em win
I’ll just keep on living
Keep on living, oh, the way I wanna live
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no
Don't let the assholes wear you out
Don't let the mean girls take the crown
Don’t let the scumbags screw you 'round
Don't let the bastards get you down

[Chorus]
Don't let the bastards get you down, oh no
Don't let the assholes wear you out
Don't let the mean girls take your crown
Don't let the scumbags screw you 'round
Don't let the bastards take you down

[Bridge]
Na-na-na, la-da-da-da-da-da, na-na, hey, na-na, hey
Na-na-na, la-da-da-da-da-da, na-na, hey, na-na, hey
Na-na-na, la-da-da-da-da-da, na-na, hey, na-na, hey
Na-na-na, la-da-da-da-da-da, na-na, hey, na-na, hey

[Outro]
So was that a good one?
Should we go again?
