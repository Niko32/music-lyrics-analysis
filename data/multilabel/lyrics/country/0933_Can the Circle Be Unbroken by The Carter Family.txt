On one cold and cloudy day
And I saw the hearse come rolling
For to carry my mother away

Can the circle be unbroken
By and by Lord, by and by
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Lord, I told the undertaker
Undertaker please drive slow
For this body you are hauling
Lord, I hate to see her go

Can the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Oh, I followed close behind her
Tried to hold up and be brave
But I could not hide my sorrow
When they laid her in the grave

Can the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
You might also likeI went back home, Lord, my home was lonesome
Since my mother, she was gone
All my brothers and sisters crying
What a home so sad and alone

Can the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

We sang songs of childhood
Hymns of faith that made us strong
Ones that mother Maybelle taught us
Hear the angels sing along

Will the circle be unbroken
Bye and bye Lord, bye and bye
There's a better home awaiting
In the sky, Lord, in the sky
