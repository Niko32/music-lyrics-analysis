I'm gonna take your dick, put it in my hole
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take your dick, put it in my hole
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 1]
Look like a horse show from the back, yeah
On the dick, I ride
Never turnin' his mic off like Nicki at Coachella, facts, yeah (Love you Nicki)
Ride it like a horse, good brain like a dork
Told him go pig out, but baby we don't eat no pork, yeah

[Refrain]
This what happens when we fuckin', yeah
Every time we get to fuckin'
Keep suckin' even when he cummin', yeah
All fingers in me like a puppet

[Verse 2]
Once he paid my rent, we been fuckin' ever since, yeah
When he finger me, he gotta wear an oven mitt (It's hot)
Hey, cum up in my nose, 2, 4, 7 give him blows
Now walkin' with bad knees, like my name was Derrick Rose (Ouch)
I can't be no cheap ho, nastier than Rico
Hit this pussy harder than a mothafuckin' Creed show
I forgot to shave, so this pussy look like hay
April showers on that dick, then baby shower up in May
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm gonna take your dick, put it in my hole
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take your dick, put it in my hole
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more

[Verse 3]
Head down, ass up, feelin' like a cockstar
Watch it grow up in my mouth every time it's not hard
Open up the box, then eat it up just like a Pop-Tart
Make the dick harder than back seats in a cop car
Why the fuck do you keep pullin' my tracks?
'Cause if it fall out, bitch, then you gluin' it back
I'm tryna suck your dick 'til my jaws get swole
I'm tryna ride like Rosa Parks on the road

[Chorus]
I'm gonna take your dick, put it in my hole
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
I'm gonna take your dick, put it in my hole
I'm gonna ride 'til I can't no more
