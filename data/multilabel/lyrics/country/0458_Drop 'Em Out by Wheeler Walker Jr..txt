Drop 'em out
One, two, three, four

[Chorus]
Drop 'em out, let me see them titties
Gonna take a long look at those tig 'ol bitties
Areolas lookin' nice, nipples lookin' real pretty
Come on, let me gander at your boobs
Drop 'em out, let me see them knockers
Gonna take a long look at those big ham hockers
Just squeeze 'em together while I play with my cocker
Come on, let me gander at your boobs

[Verse 1]
Drop 'em out, let me see them flabbies
Bounce 'em up, make an old man happy
Smack 'em around, just lay 'em on my lappie
Come on, let me jism on your boobs

[Chorus]
Drop 'em out, let me see them titties
Gonna take a long look at those tig 'ol bitties
Areolas lookin' nice, nipples lookin' real pretty
Come on, let me gander at your boobs
Drop 'em out, let me see them knockers
Gonna take a long look at those big ham hockers
Just squeeze 'em together while I play with my cocker
Come on, let me gander at your boobs
You might also like[Verse 2]
Drop 'em out
Bounce 'em up
Smack 'em around
Boobs

[Chorus]
Drop 'em out, let me see them titties
Gonna take a long look at those tig 'ol bitties
Areolas lookin' nice, nipples lookin' real pretty
Come on, let me gander at your boobs
Drop 'em out, let me see them knockers
Gonna take a long look at those big ham hockers
Just squeeze 'em together while I play with my cocker
Come on, let me gander at your boobs
