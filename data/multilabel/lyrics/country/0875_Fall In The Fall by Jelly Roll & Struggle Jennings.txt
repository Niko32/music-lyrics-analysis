Baby, if you love me, well please love me now
'Cause baby if you love me
It's my darkest hour, it's my darkest hour
If I did you wrong before, I won't do you wrong no more
It's all I've ever known, it's all I know, it's all I know
Baby, who's gon' catch you when you fall?
When you really need him who's the one that you can call?
I don't give a fuck about it, you can have it all
'Cause the leaves only fall in the fall, yeah they fall in the fall

[Verse 1: Jelly Roll]
Smokin' weed, drinkin' liquor
Some of my sins can't be forgiven
House on fire, can't leave the kitchen
I'm committed motherfuckers can't see the vision
Meanwhile I'm soaked in gasoline
The game's up and down like a trampoline
Please understand if you shake the tree
You gotta deal with the wasps and rake the leaves
Man my life had tragedy
So they taught me somethin' 'bout agony
I done seen a lot of shit go up and down
And that taught me somethin' 'bout gravity
I feel the good times over the horizon
I can feel 'em comin' with the sun shinin'
But forgive me for the times I was blinded
From the nights that I thought I was flyin'
'Til you find out that you've fallen and nobody seems to care
Say, Father, God, I'll forgive 'em now 'cause even demons need a prayer
And I changed my life I swear, through the hard times stood right there
Fuck shit, I did my share but the darkness over and I prepare
You might also like[Chorus: Jelly Roll]
Baby, if you love me, well please love me now
'Cause baby if you love me
It's my darkest hour, it's my darkest hour
If I did you wrong before, I won't do you wrong no more
It's all I've ever known, it's all I know, it's all I know
Baby, who's gon' catch you when you fall?
When you really need him who's the one that you can call?
I don't give a fuck about it, you can have it all
'Cause the leaves only fall in the fall, yeah they fall in the fall

[Verse 2: Struggle Jennings]
We fell in love under a full moon
To the sound of howlin' big dogs
Early mornin' gunfire
Blinded by the thick fog
No way out I only see a way in
I'm lookin' for the win
Follow my heart, never a trend
No fear where I've been
'Cause I'm still good at my worst
Survivin' off the lessons
Never asked, just shoot first
Though money never was the fantasy
I fantasized about my family
Gettin' out of tragedy, no casualties
Jax Teller strategy
Bastard born to anarchy
Son of the widow
I sleep pistols under pillows
Since it's eat what you kill
I bite a hard hungry hippo
While my baby weeps underneath
The branches of my willow
[Chorus: Jelly Roll]
Baby, if you love me (Oh baby if you love me), well please love me now (Please love me now)
'Cause baby if you love me (Oh baby if you love me)
It's my darkest hour, it's my darkest hour
If I did you wrong before, I won't do you wrong no more
It's all I've ever known, it's all I know, it's all I know, it's all I know
Baby, who's gon' catch you when you fall?
When you really need him who's the one that you can call?
I don't give a fuck about it, you can have it all
'Cause the leaves only fall in the fall, yeah they fall in the fall
