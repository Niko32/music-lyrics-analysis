The sun is bright, our shirts are clean
We're sitting up above the sea

Peach or plum or strawberry
Any kind is fine, you see
Come on and share this jam with me
I'll do my best to give this jam the sweetness it deser-er-er-erves

And I'll keep it fresh
I'm jammin' on these tasty preserves
[Verse 3: Steven & Connie (Zach Callison & Grace Rolek)]
Ingredients in harmony
We mix together perfectly
