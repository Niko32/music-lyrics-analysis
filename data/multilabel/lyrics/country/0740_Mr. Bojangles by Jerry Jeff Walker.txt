I knew a man
"Bojangles" and
He'd dance for you
In worn out shoes
Silver hair
A ragged shirt
And baggy pants
The old Soft Shoe

[Refrain 1]
He jumped so high
He jumped so high
He'd lightly touch down

[Chorus]
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Dance

[Verse 2]
I met him in
A cell in New Orleans
I was
Down and out
He looked to me
To be
The eyes of age
As he spoke right out
You might also like[Refrain 2]
He talked of life
He talked of life
He laugh-slapped his leg in step

[Verse 3]
He said the name
"Bojangles" and
He danced a lick
Across the cell
He grabbed his pants
A better stance
Whoa, he jumped so high
Clicked his heels

[Refrain 3]
He let go a laugh
Let go a laugh
Shook back his clothes all around

[Chorus]
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Dance
[Verse 4]
He's danced for those
At minstrel shows
And county fairs
Throughout the South
He spoke with tears
Of fifteen years
How his dog and him
They traveled about

[Refrain 4]
His dog up and died
He up and died
After twenty years he still grieves

[Verse 5]
He said "I dance
"Now at every chance
"In honky-tonks
"For drinks and tips
"But most of the time
"I spend behind
"These county bars
"'Cause I drink a bit"

[Refrain 5]
He shook his head
And as he shook his head
I heard someone ask, "Please?
[Chorus]
"Mr. Bojangles
"Mr. Bojangles
"Mr. Bojangles
"Dance"

[Instrumental]

[Verse 1]
I knew a man
"Bojangles" and
He'd dance for you
In worn out shoes
Silver hair
Baggy pants
And ragged shirt
The old Soft Shoe

[Refrain 1]
He jumped so high
He jumped so high
And then he'd lightly touch down

[Chorus]
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Mr. Bojangles
Dance

[Outro]
That is a beautiful song. You wrote that?
