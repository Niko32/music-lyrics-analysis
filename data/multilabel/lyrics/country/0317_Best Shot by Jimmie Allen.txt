I'm just flesh and bone, heart and soul
And I've earned a couple scars
I've let once in a lifetime kind of things slide right out of my arms
I've struck out, I've been knocked down
More times than I can count
But that don't matter now

[Chorus]
'Cause when you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect oh, 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you, with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot

[Verse 2]
You saw a spark inside of me that no one else could find
Your good morning eyes, they get me high
Girl, you're always on my mind

[Chorus]
'Cause when you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm not the man I was before you
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect oh, 'cause girl you know I'm not
But I'll love you, with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot
You might also like[Bridge]
When I saw you for the first time, I knew I'd found amazing grace
It's like angels singin' every time I hear your name
When you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you, I'm not the man I was before you

[Chorus]
When you smile, I see the Sun sink down on a coast out in California
And there's no doubt because of you I'm better than I was before you
I'm not sayin' that I'm perfect oh, God knows I'm not
But I'll love you with everything I've got
Girl, I'll give you my best shot

[Outro]
I'm gonna give you, I'll give you my best shot
I'm gonna give, I'm gonna give you, yeah
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, yeah
Whoa, yeah
