You took me back
But you shouldn't have
Now it's your fault if I mess around
I took a drag
But I shouldn't have
Now I'm coughin' up like I never smoked a pack

[Chorus: HAIM]
Gasoline, pretty please
I wanna get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I get sad
You know I get sad
And I can't look past what I'm sad about
You did me bad (Did me bad, did me bad)
And I did it back (Did it back, did it back)
You needed it as well, what's wrong with that?

[Chorus: HAIM, Taylor Swift, HAIM & Taylor Swift]
Gasoline (Gasoline), pretty please (Pretty please)
I wanna get off (Gasoline)
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys (Throw the keys) back to me (Back to me)
Go on and kick off your boots (Gasoline)
In the passenger seat

(Strike a match, strike a match, watch it blow)
We're watchin' the sunrise from the kitchen counter
(I want you bad, want you bad, don't you know?)
When you're lying between my legs, it doesn't matter
(Strike a match, strike a match, watch it blow)
You say you wanna go slower, but I wanna go faster
(I want you bad, want you bad)
Faster and faster

[Outro: HAIM]
Gasoline, pretty please
I wanna get off
But you're such a tease
