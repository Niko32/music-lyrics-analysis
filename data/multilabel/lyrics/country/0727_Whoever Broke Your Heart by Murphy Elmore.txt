I kinda wanna thank him
But I kinda wanna knock him out
I kinda wanna push him up against the wall
I kinda wanna buy him a round
I kinda wanna make him pay
For whatever he put you through
Ah, but then again if it wasn't for him
Guess I never woulda got to you

[Chorus]
Whoever broke your heart, he must've been crazy
Whoever didn't see the girl I see right now
Wasn't lookin' at you baby
If he didn't do what he did then
You never would've ended up here in my arms
If I know one thing is true
I ain't ever gonna be like whoever broke your heart

[Verse]
I don't even know his name
But I got a couple for him
Yeah I don't know what he was thinkin'
What he was drinkin'
But he must've kept pourin'
Cause nobody in their right mind
Would've ever said goodbye
To an angel like you
Yeah there's a lot of things I'd like to say to
You might also like[Chorus]
Whoever broke your heart, he must've been crazy
Whoever didn't see the girl I see right now
Wasn't lookin' at you baby
If he didn't do what he did then
You never would've ended up here in my arms
If I know one thing is true
I ain't ever gonna be like whoever broke your heart

[Bridge]
Whoever went and did you wrong
Whoever left you all alone
I'm sure glad that he's gone
I just wanna help you move on

[Chorus]
Whoever broke your heart, he must've been crazy
Whoever didn't see the girl I see right now
Wasn't lookin' at you baby
If he didn't do what he did then
You never would've ended up here in my arms
If I know one thing is true
I ain't ever gonna be like whoever broke your heart

[Outro]
I'm sure glad he's gone
I'll never break your heart
Whoever went and did you wrong
Whoever left you all alone
