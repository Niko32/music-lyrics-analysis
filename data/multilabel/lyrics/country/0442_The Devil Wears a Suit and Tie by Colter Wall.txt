Well Reverend, Reverend, please come quick
'Cause I got something to admit
I met a man out in the sticks of good Ole Miss
He drove a Series 10 Cadillac and wore a cigar on his lip

[Chorus]
Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie?
I saw him driving down The 61 in early July
White as a cottonfield and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by

[Verse 2]
And he said, "I know you, I know you, young man
I know you by the state of your hands
You're a six-string picker, just as I am
Let me learn you somethin': I know a few turns to make all the girls dance"

[Chorus]
Don't you know the devil wears a suit and tie?
I saw him driving down The 61 in early July
White as a cottonfield and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by

[Verse 3]
Oh foolish, foolish was I
Damn my foolish eyes
'Cause that man's lessons had a price, oh sweet price
My sweet soul everlasting, a very own eternal light
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't you know that the devil wears a suit and tie?
I saw him driving down The 61 in early July
White as a cottonfield and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by

Well, the devil wears a suit and tie
I saw him driving down The 61 in early July
White as a cottonfield and sharp as a knife
I heard him howling as he passed me by
