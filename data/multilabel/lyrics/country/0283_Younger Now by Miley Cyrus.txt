Feels like I just woke up
Like, all this time, I've been asleep
Even though it's not who I am
I'm not afraid of who I used to be

[Chorus]
No one stays the same (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You know what goes up must come down (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I feel so much younger now (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Feels like I've been living in a dream
But never make it to the end
My eyes open when they feel the light (Yeah)
It's always right before I'm about to scream

[Chorus]
No one stays the same (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You know what goes up must come down (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I feel so much younger now (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Bridge]
(Oh-oh-oh) What goes up must come down
(Oh-oh-oh) What goes up must come down
(Oh-oh-oh) What goes up must come down
(Oh-oh-oh) What goes up must come down (Yeah)

No one stays the same (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You know what goes comes back around (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Change is a thing you can count on (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
I feel so much younger now (Oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Outro]
I feel so much younger now (Yeah)
I feel so much younger now
