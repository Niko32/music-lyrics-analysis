Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap

[Verse 1]
Kiss me momma, kiss your boy
Bless me well and lucky
For I won't be back 'til I return
I'm gone to old Kentucky
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
That's what the scouts all tell ya
Sure enough it may get tough
If it doesn't kill ya, kill ya

[Chorus]
Kentucky, she's a-waiting on the other side
Give you the fever, put the daylight in your eyes

[Verse 2]
Brother John's already gone
With a full-blood Cherokee maiden
He made the trip in the blizzard's grip
I'd rather wrestle Satan
Cumberland gap, devil of a gap
Oh, the snow kept coming
Picked her up upon his back
By God, he loved that woman!

[Verse 3]
Daniel stood on the pinnacle rock
Lookin' up and down the mountain
Took his trusty old flint-lock
Daniel started shoutin', shoutin':

[Chorus]
Kentucky, she's a-waiting on the other side
Give you the fever, put the daylight in your eyes

[Refrain]
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
Cumberland gap, it's a devil of a gap
