[Verse 1]
It's another tequila sunrise
Starin' slowly 'cross the sky
I said goodbye
He was just a hired hand
Workin' on the dreams he planned to try
The days go by

[Bridge]
Every night when the sun goes down
Just another lonely boy in town
And she's out runnin' 'round

[Verse 2]
She wasn't just another woman
And I couldn't keep from comin' on
It's been so long
Woah, and it's a hollow feelin'
When it comes down to dealin' friends
It never ends

[Instrumental Interlude]â€‹

[Verse 3]
Take another shot of courage
Wonder why the right words never come
You just get numb
It's another tequila sunrise
This old world still looks the same
