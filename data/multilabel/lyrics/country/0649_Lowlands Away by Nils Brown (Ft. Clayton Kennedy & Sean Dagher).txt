I dreamed a dream the other night
Lowlands, lowlands away, me John
My love, she came, dressed all in white
Lowlands away

[Verse 2]
I dreamed my love came in my sleep
Lowlands, lowlands away, me John
Her cheeks were wet, her eyes did weep
Lowlands away

[Verse 3]
She came to me at my bedside
Lowlands, lowlands away, me John
All dressed in white, like some fair bride
Lowlands away

[Verse 4]
And bravely in her bosom fair
Lowlands, lowlands away, me John
Her red, red rose, my love did wear
Lowlands away

[Verse 5]
She made no sound, no word she said
Lowlands, lowlands away, me John
And then I knew my love was dead
Lowlands away
You might also like[Verse 6]
Then I awoke to hear the cry
Lowlands, lowlands away, me John
Oh, watch on deck, oh, watch, ahoy!
Lowlands away
