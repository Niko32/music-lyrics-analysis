Woah-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
The only poison I've had is ivy
The only man I fear is God
No snakes can make me run now
'Cause I've been bit by 'em all
No buck can stare me down
No neighbor can shut me up
I'm off the grid and I'm off my rocker
I'm off in the holler, son

[Chorus]
We them holler boys
Holler if you're needin' somethin' done
Holler if you need a chip on a shoulder
And a hand with a loaded gun
We'll be out that screen door, no shirt on
Leavin' two black marks down a one-lane road
Yeah we, yeah we
Yeah, we them holler boys

[Verse 2]
The only fight I've ever been in
Was takin' up for somebody else
The only time I got my jaw jacked is never
But damn sure not quite yet
The times I miss the most
Are the times nobody knows
When it was me, my cousin, and a couple of my buddies
Racin' down ol' Sams Creek Road
You might also like[Chorus]
We them holler boys
Holler if you're needin' somethin' done
Holler if you need a chip on a shoulder
And a hand with a loaded gun
We'll be out that screen door, no shirt on
Leavin' two black marks down a one-lane road
Yeah we, yeah we
Yeah we them holler boys

[Bridge]
Holler boy, native to the holler soil
Washed in the spring of a farmer's joy
We them holler boys
Holler if you're needin' somethin' done
Holler if you need a chip on a shoulder
Or a hand with a loaded gun

[Chorus]
We them holler boys
Holler if you're needin' somethin' done
Holler if you need a chip or a shoulder
And a hand with a loaded gun
We'll be out that screen door, no shirt on
Leavin' two black marks down a one-lane road
Yeah we, yeah we
Yeah, we them holler boys
