I probably shouldn't have said hello
When I saw you out with your friends
I know I should've left it alone
When I caught you looking

[Pre-Chorus]
A little smile, a little how you been
A little touch, a little reminisce
It always starts off innocent

[Chorus]
But after a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few

[Verse 2]
We always take it way too far
Where it's too much to resist
We always make it way too hard
To walk away after that third kiss
You might also like[Pre Chorus]
We pretend that we'll be fine
Through the sting of the morning light
'Cause it happens every time

[Chorus]
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh yeah, after a few

[Bridge]
Little smile, little how you been
Little touch, little reminisce
We both know how it ends

[Chorus]
After a few drinks
It's always the same thing
We find ourselves lost in conversation at the bar
Then after a few songs
The kind that you hold on
We find ourselves leaning up against my car
Shoulda stopped at one
Said goodbye, given up at two
If we didn't wanna wind up falling into my bed like we always do
After a few
Oh, after a few
