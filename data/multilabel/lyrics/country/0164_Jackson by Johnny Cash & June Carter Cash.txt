We got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
We've been talkin' 'bout Jackson ever since the fire went out
I'm going to Jackson, I'm gonna mess around
Yeah, I'm goin' to Jackson
Look out, Jackson town

[Verse 2: June Carter, Johnny Cash]
Well, go on down to Jackson, go ahead and wreck your health
Go play your hand, you big-talkin' man, and make a big fool of yourself
Yeah, go to Jackson, go comb your hair
Honey, I'm gonna snowball Jackson
See if I care

[Verse 3: Johnny Cash & June Carter]
When I breeze into that city, people gonna stoop and bow (Hah)
All them women gonna make me, teach 'em what they don't know how
I'm goin' to Jackson, you turn-a loose-a my coat
'Cause I'm goin' to Jackson
"Goodbye," that's all she wrote

[Verse 4: June Carter]
But they'll laugh at you in Jackson, and I'll be dancin' on a Pony Keg
They'll lead you 'round town like a scolded hound
With your tail tucked between your legs
Yeah, go to Jackson, you big-talkin' man
And I'll be waitin' in Jackson, behind my Japan Fan

Ain't never comin' back

[Outro: Johnny Cash & Both]
Well, we got married in a fever, hotter than a pepper sprout
Honey, we've been talkin' 'bout Jackson, ever since the fire went
