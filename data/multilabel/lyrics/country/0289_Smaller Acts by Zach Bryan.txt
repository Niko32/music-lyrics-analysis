She's got a need to leave you wantin' more
She loves hard love and metaphors
Leave your shoes off at the door
'Cause dinner's waitin' on you
Grand things don't impress her much
She's keen to smaller acts
She likes honey in her coffee
And boys that use their backs

[Verse 2]
Friday afternoon at the Mercury Lounge
She loves a Prince song and a live sound
Never needs much and sure knows how to dance
All the money in the world couldn't make her smile
Shе prefers things that are worth whilе
Like small towns, that old style, and smaller acts

[Chorus]
There ain't no love a man can find
You'd feel her in a room if you was blind
There ain't a grand thing a man can do
She'll only love you for you

[Verse 3]
She's satisfied in the scorchin' summer
Like the trees and stars she's layin' under
They're fine bein' right where they are
Give her a buzz and a beat-down boy
She hates bullshit and loves the noise
Of a coastal town the early parts of fall
You might also like[Chorus]
There ain't no love a boy can find
You'll feel her in a room if you was blind
There ain't a thing a man can do
She'll only love you for you

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
There ain't no love a man can find
You'll feel her in a room if you was blind
There ain't a thing a man can do
She'll only love you for you
