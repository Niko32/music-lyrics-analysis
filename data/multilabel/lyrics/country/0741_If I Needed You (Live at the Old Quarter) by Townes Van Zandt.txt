Well if I needed you, would you come to me?
Would you come to me and ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you
I'd swim the seas for to ease your pain

[Verse 2]
In the night forlorn ah the morning's born
And the morning shines with the lights of love
You will miss sunrise if you close your eyes
And that would break my heart in two

[Verse 3]
The lady's with me now since I showed her how
To lay her lily hand in mine
Loop and Lil agree she's a sight to see
And a treasure for the poor to find

[Verse 1]
If I needed you, would you come to me?
Would you come to me and ease my pain?
If you needed me, I would come to you
I'd swim the seas for to ease your painYou might also like
