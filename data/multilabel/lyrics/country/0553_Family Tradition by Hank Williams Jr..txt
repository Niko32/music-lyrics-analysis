Country music singers have always been a real close family
But lately some of my kinfolks have disowned a few others and me
I guess it's because I kind of changed my direction
Lord, I guess I went and broke their family tradition
They get on me, they wanna know

[Chorus 1]
"Hank, why do you drink, Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?"
Over and over, everybody made my prediction
So, if I get stoned, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition

[Verse 2]
I am very proud of my daddy's name
Although his kind of music and mine ain't exactly the same
Stop and think it over, put yourself in my position
If I get stoned and sing all night long, it's a family tradition
So don't ask me

[Chorus 2]
"Hank, why do you drink, Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?"
If I'm down in a honky-tonk and some ol' slick's trying to give me friction
I say, "Leave me alone, I'm singing all night long, it's a family tradition"

Lordy, I have loved some ladies, and I have loved Jim Beam
And they both tried to kill me in 1973
When that doctor asked me, "Son, how'd you get in this condition?"
I said, "A-hey, Sawbones, I'm just carrying on an old family tradition"
So don't ask me

[Chorus 3]
"Hank, why do you drink, Hank, why do you roll smoke?
Why must you live out the songs that you wrote?"
Stop and think it over, try to put yourself in my unique position
If I get stoned and sing all night long, it's a family tradition
