Let's go, girls

[Verse 1]
Saw a poster on the corner opposite the motel
Turns out I'm going to Hell if I keep on being myself
Don't know what I did, but they seem pretty mad about it
God hates us? Alright then
Buckle up, at dawn, we're riding

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk a mile on these coals, busy cleansing my soul
Getting ready for the night
Damned for eternity, but you're coming with me
Into the afterlife

[Chorus]
This Hell is better with you
We're burning up together
Baby, that makes two
'Cause the Devil's wearing Prada
And loves a little drama, ooh-ooh
This Hell is better with you

[Post-Chorus]
With you
With you
Oh, with you
This Hell is better with you
You might also like[Verse 2]
Flame red carpet moment, posing for the paparazzi
Fuck what they did to Britney, to Lady Di and Whitney
Don't know why we're here, but might as well get down and dirty
That Satan's looking thirsty, not even he can hurt me

[Pre-Chorus]
Walk a mile on these coals, busy cleansing my soul
Getting ready for the night
Damned for eternity, but you're coming with me
Into the afterlife (Wow, that's hot)

[Chorus]
This Hell is better with you
We're burning up together, baby, that makes two
'Cause the Devil's wearing Prada
And loves a little drama, ooh-ooh
This Hell is better with you
This life gave us nothing to lose
We're going down together, got a ticket for two
'Cause the Devil's wearing Prada
And loves a little drama, ooh-ooh
This Hell is better with you

[Post-Chorus]
With you
With you
Oh, with you
(This Hell is better with you)
[Bridge]
Got my invitation to eternal damnation
Get in line, pass the wine, bitch
We're going straight to Hell
Got my invitation to eternal damnation
Get in line, pass the wine, bitch
We're going straight to Hell

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
This Hell is better with you
We're burning up together, baby, that makes two
'Cause the Devil's wearing Prada
And loves a little drama, ooh-ooh
This Hell is better with you

[Post-Chorus]
This Hell is better with you (I'm in this Hell with you)
This Hell is better with you (With you, with you)
This Hell is better with you (Ooh)
(This Hell is better with you)
