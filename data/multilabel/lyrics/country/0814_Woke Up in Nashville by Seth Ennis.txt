I woke up in Nashville
But it still felt like a dream
Like the one I've been chasing
Since the day I first played my dad's six string

[Pre-Chorus]
I loaded up the hand-me-down car
Went for broke, broke your heart
Didn't wanna but, girl, I thought I had to
But dreaming's just sleeping here without you

[Chorus]
So, hello
I'm really glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby, I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without
Thought everything I wanted was in this town
But you were all that I needed all along
It took me long enough
But I woke up

[Verse 2]
I woke up in Nashville
'Cause those Broadway lights don't shine
The way that your eyes did
When they were staring back, right back in mine
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Been trying to live with only half of my heart
Just sleepwalking in the Tennessee dark
If I can't make every memory with you
Then dreaming's just sleeping here without you

[Chorus]
So, hello
I'm really glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby, I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without
Thought everything I wanted was in this town
But you were all that I needed all along
It took me long enough
But I woke up

[Bridge]
In a cold sweat
And catching my breath
Dropping my pride
And dropping you a line
I don't know where you are
I don't know who you're with
I don't know what to say
But I'm saying it
[Chorus]
Hello
I'm glad you picked up your phone
I had to tell you, baby, I was so wrong for thinking you
Were something I could ever do without
Thought everything I wanted was in this town
But you were all that I needed all along
It took me long enough
But I woke up

[Outro]
I woke up in Nashville
Just thinking of you still
