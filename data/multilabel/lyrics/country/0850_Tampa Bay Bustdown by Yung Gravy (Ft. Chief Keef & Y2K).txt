Runnin' through the crib with a stick like Harry Potter (Bang, bang)
Go ahead run up and we can get it Mary Poppin'
Since I got guap, these bitches can’t tell me nothin'
Girl I'm numb and I ain't feelin' nothin' (Yee-haw)
Why you got a pistol? You ain't killin' nothin’
Ring ring, we got the drop, we finna drop every opp (Ayy, ayy, ayy)
Hopped in the ’Rari, and tell that bitch "Giddy up" (Ayy, ffft)
