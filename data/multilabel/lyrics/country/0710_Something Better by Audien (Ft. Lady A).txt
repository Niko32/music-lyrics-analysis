I never met you, but I know you're out there
If I cross the oceans, would you be there?

[Pre-Chorus: Hillary Scott]
A stranger's eyes that somehow look familiar
I know that when it's you, I'll remember
Remember

[Chorus: Both]
So wait for me; I swear I'll find you
Climbing every wall that hides you
I know we were meant for something better
So wait for me; the world is changing
Underneath, the ground is shaking
You and I were meant for something better
Better, oh

[Post-Chorus: Hillary Scott]
I swear I'll find you

[Verse 2: Charles Kelley & (Hillary Scott)]
I feel the wind move; we breathe the same air
(You're like the best news that I can't share)

[Pre-Chorus: Hillary Scott]
A stranger's eyes that somehow look familiar (Somehow look familiar)
I know that when it's you, I'll remember
Remember
You might also like[Chorus: Both]
So wait for me; I swear I'll find you
Climbing every wall that hides you
I know we were meant for something better
So wait for me; the world is changing
Underneath, the ground is shaking
You and I were meant for something better
Better, oh
Oh
So wait for me; the world is changing
Underneath, the ground is shaking
You and I were meant for something better
Better, oh

[Outro: Hillary Scott]
I swear I'll find you
Oh
Meant for something better
Better, oh
