You remind me of a Sunday
Back home in ol' Kentucky
With the church choirs just beltin' to the pines
And I love you like the mountains
Love's the way the mornin' opens
To a soft and bright greetin' from the sun

[Chorus]
So if it'd make you stay
I wouldn't act so angry all the time
I wouldn't keep it all inside
And I'd let you know how much I loved you every day
So darlin' will you stay right here and shake this frost off of my bones

[Verse 2]
Well I used to ride a Mustang
And I'd run that thing on high hopes
'Til they raised the price of dreams so high I couldn't pay
So I let that car just sit there
When I should've took you driving
With the windows down while the music played

[Chorus]
So if it'd make you stay
I wouldn't act so angry all the time
I wouldn't keep it all inside
And I'd let you know how much I loved you every day
So darlin' will you stay right here and shake this frost off of my bones
You might also like[Outro]
Darlin' will you stay right here and shake this frost off of my bones
