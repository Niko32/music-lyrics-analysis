Was a boy who was a dreamer and he flew so high and proud
In a world full of people out to cut his young ass down
No one ever understood a single word he said
They cast him to the wolves when he wasn't well and fed

[Verse 2]
Boys, we've got a riser, a riser in our midsts
And he will get the last laugh, if it's the last thing he did
And he used to roll around in that red dirt mud
But now he's skipping town and that dreamer's out for blood

[Chorus]
Don't stop goin', goin' south
'Cause they'll let you play your music real damn loud
Don't stop headin', headin' south
They will understand the words that are pourin' from your mouth

[Verse 3]
And that dreamer called his daddy to tell him what he did
As the masses scream the lyrics of a messed up kid
And then he told his daddy he was never comin' back
To be cut down again in a town like that

[Bridge]
And he surely came to learn people come to watch you fall
That dreamer's out to make a name and a fool out of 'em all
And they'll never understand that boy and his kind
'Cause all they comprehend is a fucking dollar sign
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't stop goin', goin' south
'Cause they'll let you play your music real damn loud
Don't stop headin', headin' south
'Cause they will understand the words that are pourin' from your mouth
Don't stop goin', goin' south
'Cause they'll let you play your music real damn loud
Don't stop headin', headin' south
'Cause they will understand the words that are pourin' from your mouth
