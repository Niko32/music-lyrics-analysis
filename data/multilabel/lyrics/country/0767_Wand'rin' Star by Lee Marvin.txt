I was born under a wandering star

Wheels are made for rolling, mules are made to pack
I've never seen a sight that didn't look better looking back

I was born under a wandering star

Mud can make you prisoner, and the plains can bake you dry
Snow can burn your eyes, but only people make you cry
Home is made for coming from, for dreams of going to
Which with any luck will never come true

I was born under a wandering star
I was born under a wandering star

Do I know where hell is? Hell is in "hello"
Heaven is goodbye forever, it's time for me to go

I was born under a wandering star
A wandering, wandering star

(Mud can make you prisoner, and the plains can bake you dry
Snow can burn your eyes, but only people make you cry
Home is made for coming from, for dreams of going to
Which with any luck will never come true)

When I get to heaven tie me to a tree
Or I'll begin to roam, and soon you'll know where I will be

I was born under a wandering star
A wandering, wandering star
