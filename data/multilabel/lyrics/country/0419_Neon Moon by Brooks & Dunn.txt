When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feelin' comes to my door
And the whole world turns
Blue

[Verse 2]
There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two, way in the back
Where I sit alone
And think of losin' you

[Pre-Chorus]
I spend most every night
Beneath the light of a neon moon

[Chorus]
Now if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon

[Verse 3]
I think of two young lovers, runnin' wild and free
I close my eyes and sometimes see
You in the shadows
Of this smoke-filled room
You might also like[Verse 4]
No tellin' how many tears I've sat here and cried
Or how many lies that I've lied
Tellin' my poor heart
She'll come back someday

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light from a neon moon

[Chorus]
Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon

[Verse 5]
The jukebox plays on, drink by drink
And the words of every sad song seem to say what I think
And this hurt inside of me
Ain't never gonna end

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I'll be alright
As long as there's light from a neon moon
[Chorus]
Oh, if you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

[Outro]
Come watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon
Oh, watch your broken dreams dance
In and out of the beams of a neon moon
