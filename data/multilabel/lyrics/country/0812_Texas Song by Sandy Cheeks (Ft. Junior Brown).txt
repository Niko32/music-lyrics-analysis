What's wrong with Sandy?
Maybe it's just a squirrel thing

[Verse 1: Sandy]
Wish I was back in Texas
The ocean's no place for a squirrel
Wish I was in Texas, prettiest place in the world, oh no
I guess deep in my heart I'll always be a Texas girl
I wanna go ho-oh-oh-oh, home

[Chorus]
Yodel-ay-e-oh
Yodel-ay-e-oh
Yodel-ay-e-oh
Ley-e, ley-e

[Verse 2: Sandy & Junior Brown]
Home, I wanna wake up in Texas
I miss those wide open skies
I miss my 20 acres, bar-b-ques and pecan pies, oh why?
When I'm so far from you, Texas, all I can do is cry

[Chorus]
Yodel-ay-e-oh
Yodel-ay-e-oh
Yodel-ay-e-oh
A-Ley-e, a-ley-e
