Goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh
Me gotta go pole the pirogue down the bayou
My Yvonne, the sweetest one, me oh my oh
Son of me gun we'll have big fun on the bayou

[Chorus]
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie on a filé gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, filled fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of me gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

[Verse 2]
The Thibodauxs, the Fontaineauxs, the place is buzzin'
Kinfolk come to see Yvonne by the dozen
Dress in style and go hog wild, me oh my oh
Son of me gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Settle down far from town get me a pirogue
And I'll catch all the fish in the bayou

[Chorus]
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie on a filé gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, filled fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of me gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
You might also like[Chorus]
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie on a filé gumbo
'Cause tonight I'm gonna see my ma cher amio
Pick guitar, filled fruit jar and be gay-o
Son of me gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou
Son of me gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou

[Verse 3]
Later on, swap my mon, get me a pirogue
And I'll catch all the fish on the bayou
Swap my mon, to buy Yvonne what she need-oh
Son of a gun we'll have big fun on the bayou
Jambalaya and a crawfish pie...
