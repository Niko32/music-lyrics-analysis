And if I said
I really knew you well
What would your answer be?
If you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Here today

[Verse 2]
Well, knowing you
You'd probably laugh and say
That we were worlds apart
If you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Here today

[Bridge]
But as for me
I still remember how it was before
And I am holding back the tears no more
Ooh, ooh, ooh
I love you
Ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 3]
What about the time we met? (What about the time we met?)
Well, I suppose that you could say
That we were playin' hard to get
Didn't understand a thing
But we could always sing
You might also like[Verse 4]
What about the night we cried? (What about the night we cried?)
Because there wasn't any reason left
To keep it all inside
Never understood a word
But you were always there with a smile

[Outro]
And if I say
I really loved you
And was glad you came along
Then you were here today
Ooh, ooh, ooh
For you were in my song
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Here today
