While on the road to sweet Athy, hurroo hurroo
While on the road to sweet Athy, hurroo hurroo
While on the road to sweet Athy
A stick in the hand, a drop in the eye
A doleful damsel I did cry
Johnny I hardly knew ya

[Verse 1]
Where are the eyes that looked so mild, hurroo hurroo
Where are the eyes that looked so mild, hurroo hurroo
Where are the eyes that looked so mild
When my poor heart you first beguiled
Why did ya run from me and the child
Johnny I hardly knew ya

[Chorus]
We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy never slew ya
Johnny I hardly knew ya

[Verse 2]
Where are the legs with which you run, hurroo hurroo
Where are the legs with which you run, hurroo hurroo
Where are the legs with which you run
When first you went to carry a gun
Indeed your dancing days are done, Johnny I hardly knew ya
You might also like[Chorus]
We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy never slew ya
Johnny I hardly knew ya

[Verse 3]
You hadn't an arm, you hadn't a leg, hurroo hurroo
You hadn't an arm, you hadn't a leg, hurroo hurroo
You hadn't an arm, you hadn't a leg
You're an eyeless, boneless, chickenless egg
You'll have to be put with the bowl to beg
Johnny I hardly knew ya

[Chorus]
We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy never slew ya
Johnny I hardly knew ya

[Bridge]
I'm happy for to see ya home, hurroo hurroo
I'm happy for to see ya home, hurroo hurroo
I'm happy for to see ya home from the isle of Ceylon
Johnny I hardly knew ya
[Chorus]
We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns, hurroo hurroo
We had guns and drums and drums and guns
The enemy never slew ya
Johnny I hardly knew ya
