Still falling
Breathless and on again
Inside today
Beside me today
Around, broken in two
'Til your eyes shed into dust
Like two strangers turning into dust
'Til my hand shook with the weight of fear

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I could possibly be fading
Or have something more to gain
I could feel myself growing colder
I could feel myself under your fate

[Refrain]
Under your fate

[Verse 3]
It was you, breathless and tall
I could feel my eyes turning into dust
And two strangers turning into dust
Turning into dustYou might also like
