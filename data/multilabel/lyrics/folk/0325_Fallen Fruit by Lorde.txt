To the ones who came before us
All the golden ones who were lifted on a wing
We had no idea the dreams we had were far too big
Far too big

[Verse 2]
And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
Through the halls of splendor where the apple trees all grew
You'll leave us dancing on the fallen fruit

[Chorus]
The fallen fruit
The fallen fruit (Ooh)
The fallen fruit
[Bridge]
From the Nissan to the Phantom to the plane
We'll disappear in the cover of the rain
Took the great minds and the vapers
And a pocketful of seed
It's time for us to leave

[Verse 3]
And we will walk together (We will walk)
Psychedelic garlands in our hair
But how can I love what I know I am gonna lose?
Don't make me choose
You might also like[Chorus]
The fallen fruit
The fallen fruit
The fallen fruit
