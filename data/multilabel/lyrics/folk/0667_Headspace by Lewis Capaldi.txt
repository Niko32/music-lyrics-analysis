Salt of the earth, my friend
It's all that we are in the end
Well, you trapped down all the lines you drew
And I can take the hit but I'm sorry, I don't want the bruise
Your voice gets a little loud
When there's nothing to talk about, you shout, dear

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll find my lights fading out
More and more by the hour
It gets dark in here

[Chorus]
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
Slip into my headspace while I dream
Spin me a yarn, wrap it up around me

[Verse 2]
Dust to dust, my friend
Well, you're only blood and bones
And I know your heart's at war with your head
I am sure it hurt to see
You're more than I'll ever have
And more than I'll ever be
I know it's a little late
My timing was never great
But I'm calling, dear
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanted to let you know
That I won't bother you anymore
I'll be gone this time next year

[Chorus]
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
Slip into my headspace while I dream
Spin me a yarn, wrap it up around me
If you got time enough for me
Sing me a song and send me to sleep
I never thought that a lie could sound so sweet
Until you opened your mouth
And you said you loved me
