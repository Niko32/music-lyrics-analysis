Here comes a story of a hurricane
And a temper lost like crying tears in rain
No love is lost or no sweet wisdom gained
So save your tears then save yourself the shame

[Chorus]
Cyclone
Youâ€™re on your own

[Verse 2]
As we left the house and took a step outside
I could taste in the air a familiar sense of pride
And the wind, it blows, as you held your head up high
Then I saw the clouds draw storms into your eyes

[Chorus]
Cyclone
You're on your own
Cyclone
You're on your own

[Verse 3]
He's my man but said, "Don't break him bones"
Out in the fire, won't leave it alone
It was bent and I was unable to pull him inside
So bend down them bridges, dig up them bones
What's that you got? 'Cause I'll have one of those
Darcy, I could never hate ya if I tried
You might also like[Chorus]
Cyclone
You're on your own
Cyclone
You're on your own

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Cyclone
You're on your own
Cyclone
