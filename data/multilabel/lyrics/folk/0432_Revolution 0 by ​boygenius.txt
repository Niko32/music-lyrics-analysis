Mm, mm, mm, mm

[Verse 1: Bridgers]
Imaginary friend, you live up in my head
So I've been making music
Since you told me to do it
I just wanna know who broke your nose
Figure out where they live
So I can kick their teeth in

[Chorus: All]
If it isn’t love
Then what the fuck is it?
I guess just let me pretend

[Verse 2: Bridgers]
I don't wanna die, that's a lie
But I’m afraid to get sick
I don't know what that is
You wanted a song
So it's gonna be a short one
Wish I wasn't so tired, but I'm tired

[Chorus: All]
If you're not enough
Then I give up
And then, nothing is
You might also like[Bridge: All]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Ah, ah, ah, ah

[Outro: Bridgers, Baker]
I used to think
If I just closed my eyes
I'd disappear
(There's absolutеly nothing going on)
(Okay)
