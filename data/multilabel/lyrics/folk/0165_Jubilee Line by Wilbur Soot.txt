[Verse 1: Wilbur Soot]
Wasting your time
You're wasting mine
I hate to see you leaving
Fate worse than dying

[Verse 2: Wilbur Soot]
Your city gave me asthma
So that's why I'm fucking leaving
And your water gave me cancer
And the pavement hurt my feelings

[Bridge: Wilbur Soot]
Shout at the wall
'Cause the walls don't fucking love you
Shout at the wall
'Cause the walls don't fucking love you
[Acoustic Guitar Solo]

[Refrain: Wilbur Soot]
There's a reason
That London puts barriers on the tube line
There's a reason
That London puts barriers on the rails
There's a reason
That London puts barriers on the tube line
There's a reason
That London puts barriers on the rails
There's a reason
That London puts barriers on the tube line
