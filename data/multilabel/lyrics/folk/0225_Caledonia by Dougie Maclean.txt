I don't know if you can see the changes that have come over me
In these last few days I've been afraid that I might drift away
So I've been telling old stories, singing songs that make me think about where I came from
And that's the reason why I seem so far away today

[Chorus]
But let me tell you that I love you, that I think about you all the time
Caledonia, you're calling me, and now I'm going home
But if I should become a stranger you know that it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had

[Verse 2]
I have moved and I've kept on moving, proved the points that I needed proving
Lost the friends that I needed losing, found others on the way
I have kissed the ladies and left them crying, stolen dreams, yes there's no denying
I have travelled hard, sometimes with conscience flying somewhere with the wind

[Chorus]
But let me tell you that I love you, that I think about you all the time
Caledonia, you're calling me, and now I'm going home
But if I should become a stranger you know that it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had

[Verse 3]
Now I'm sitting here before the fire, the empty room, the forest choir
The flames that couldn't get any higher, well they've withered, now they've gone
But I'm steady thinking, my way is clear and I know what I will do tomorrow
When the hands have shaken and the kisses flow, well I will disappear
You might also like[Chorus]
But let me tell you that I love you, that I think about you all the time
Caledonia, you're calling me, and now I'm going home
For if I should become a stranger you know that it would make me more than sad
Caledonia's been everything I've ever had
