The only time I got to praying for a red light
Was when I saw your destination as a deadline
"This is normal conversation, babe, it's all fine"
Making quiet calculations where the fault lies
This is good land, or at least it was
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind

[Verse 2]
The college kids are getting so young, ain't they?
They're correcting all the grammar on a spray paint
And I even gave up driving after nightfall
I got tired of the frat boys with their brights on
This is good land, or at least it was
It takes a strong hand and a sound mind

[Pre-Chorus]
It makes me smile to know when things get hard
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far
Ooh-ooh, you'll bе far from here
And, while I clеan shit up in the yard
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far
Ooh-ooh, you'll be far, far from here

[Chorus]
So, pack up your car, put a hand on your heart
Say whatever you feel, be wherever you are
We ain't angry at you, love
You're the greatest thing we've lost
The birds will still sing
Your folks will still fight
The boards will still creak
The leaves will still die
We ain't angry at you, love
We'll be waiting for you, love
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
And we'll all be here forever
And we'll all be here forever
We sure will

[Verse 3]
We're overdue for a revival
We spent so long just getting by
That's the thing about survival
Who the hell— who the hell likes livin' just to die?
You told me you would make a difference
Well, I got drunk and shut you down
It won't be by your own volition
If you step foot outside this town
But it's all we've had
For always

[Chorus]
So, pack up your car, put a hand on your heart
Say whatever you feel, be wherever you are
We ain't angry at you, love
You're the greatest thing we've lost
The birds will still sing
Your folks will still fight
The boards will still creek
The leaves will still die
We ain't angry at you, love
We'll be waiting for you, love
[Post-Chorus]
And we'll all be here forever
And we'll all be here forever

[Outro]
You're gonna go far
You're gonna go far
You're gonna go far
You're gonna go far
Yes, you are
(Ooh-ooh)
If you wanna go far
Then you gotta go far

[Instrumental Outro]
