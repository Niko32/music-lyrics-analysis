I swore that I'd become a better man for you and I tried
I tried to change my ways and walk the line you follow
I bore a flame that burned a thousand suns for you, but it died
I told you I could never love somebody else, but I lied

[Chorus: Ben Schneider]
Mm-mm, mm-mm, I lied
Mm-mm, mm-mm, I lied

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2: Ben Schneider]
I told you I'd be coming back again for you, but I'm not
I'm going way out where the world will never find me
I made a claim that I would dance until we're bones with my bride
I told you I would never leave you all alone, but I lied

[Break: Allison Ponthier]
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

[Verse 3: Allison Ponthier, with Ben Schneider]
I read your letter in the morning by the lake and I cried
They were tears of joy, my chains are finally broken
I made a vow to stand beside you till the day that I die
Told you I could never live without your love, but I lied

Mm-mm, mm-mm, I lied
Mm-mm, mm-mm, I lied
Mm-mm, mm-mm, I lied
Mm-mm, mm-mm, I lied
Mm-mm, mm-mm, I lied
Mm-mm, mm-mm, I lied
