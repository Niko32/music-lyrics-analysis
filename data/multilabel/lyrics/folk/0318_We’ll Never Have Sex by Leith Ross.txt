Depollute me, pretty baby
Suck the rot right out of my bloodstream
Oh, dilute me, gentle angel
Water down what I called being grateful

[Chorus]
Oh, you kissed me just to kiss me
Not to take me home
It was simple, it was sweetness
It was good to know

[Verse 2]
You look perfect, you look different
I don't wonder about your indifference
If I said you could never touch me
You'd come over and say I looked lovely

[Chorus]
Oh, you kissed me just to kiss me
Not to make mе cry
It was simple, you are sweetness
Lеt's just sit a while

[Verse 3]
Depollute me, gentle angel
And I'll feel the sickness less and less
Come and kiss me, pretty baby
Like we'll never have sexYou might also like
