All of this turbulence wasn't forecasted
Apologies from the intercom
And I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
They'll think of me kindly when they come for my things

[Chorus]
They'll never know how I'd stared at the dark in that room
With no thoughts like a blood-sniffing shark
And while my dreams made music in the night
Carefully, I was going to live

[Verse 2]
You wouldn't leave 'til we loved in the morning
You'd learned from movies how love ought to be
And you'd say you love me and look in my eyes
But I know through mine, you were looking in yours

[Chorus]
And did you know the Liberty Bell is a replica
Silently housed in its original walls
And while its dreams played music in the night
Quietly, it was told to believe

[Bridge]
I always wanted to die clean and pretty
But I'd be too busy on working days
So I am relieved that the turbulence wasn't forecasted
I couldn't have changed anyways
You might also like[Outro]
I am relieved that I'd left my room tidy
Goodbye
