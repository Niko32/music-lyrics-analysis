I tried to tell you
I didn't know how to stay
You believe she can see through
Cutting at the silent clay
A relief, beckon deep blue
Fettered in the magnet sun
Eat the gun as it feeds you
Spitting up the oxygen
Once again
Once again

[Verse 2]
Once again, empty horses
Gallop through the violet door
Follow red, crooked courses
Shadows on the moonlit floor
Oh, my stars, winged creatures
Gathering in silken height
Like the last human teachers

[Verse 3]
Once again, wе must bleed new
Even as the hours shakе
Crystal blood like a dream true
A ripple in the wound and wake
You believe, I believe too
That you are the river of light
Who I love, that I cling to
In the belly of the empty night
You might also like[Chorus]
From the thirty-first floor of the simulation swarm
With the drone of fluorescence
Flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch
Like we never could before
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms
And walk you to the shore

[Verse 4]
I remember building an energy shield
In your room, like a temple
Swallows in the windless field
Very thin, with your mother
Tall as a pale green tree
Very wild, bright as winter
Rising with a prism key
And a child to deliver
Taken with the blood and vine
As the first little angel

[Verse 5]
Little Andy, soft in your newborn skin
Only one, little Andy, will you return again?
I believe we can renew
And you could be my brother
Once again, fall asleep with our backs against each other
You believe, I believe too
That you are the river of light who I love
That I sing to in the belly of the empty night
[Chorus]
From the thirty-first floor of the simulation swarm
With the drone of fluorescence
Flicker, fever, fill the form
With a warm gush, now I wanna touch
Like we never could before
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms
And walk you to the shore
I'd fly to you tomorrow, I'm not fighting in this war
I wanna drop my arms and take your arms
