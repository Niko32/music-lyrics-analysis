I am not allowed to have feelings
Feelings would complicate this
I'm a stupid ugly stuttering asshole
There is no dignity in my anger

Mind if I cough in your ear all night?
Mind if I resent you for a year tonight?
I am not the type of man
Who can fall asleep in someone else's arms
(Didn't mean to lie about it all)
I love you
Sometimes I love you
But it's hard to say
There are times when I don't love
I can't love anything in this world

The final phrase of my last sentence
Hangs in the air, sounding stupider and stupider

I tried so hard to find the right words
But it's a matter of timing, you only have so long
To capture the feeling before it's gone
Here is a demo of my latest sentence
I'll fill in the good parts later
I'll make it fit together real nice
And cut out all the "likes"
Two days ago it was really bad
I couldn't get my head straight all day
And everything you said seemed to have an edge
You were disappointed and I didn't know why
Eventually it came to a head
Over something as stupid as making coffee
You said it was a mistake to ever try and help me
Then you went in the kitchen
I drove off to go buy some stuff
Which was a mistake because
I didn't want to come back
I just sat in the parking lot
And dabbed at my thumb, which was bleeding for some reason
Leaving a trail of red blossoms on the napkin
I felt sick and I didn't know what to do
How long would it be before I could face you?

Flashback to the first angry song I had to hide from you
It goes like this:
I am hiding from you at the
