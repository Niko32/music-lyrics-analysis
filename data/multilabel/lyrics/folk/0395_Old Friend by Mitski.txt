We nearly drowned for such a silly thing
Someone who loves me now better than you
And that pretty friend is finally yours
And, I'll be around on Sunday

[Chorus]
If you'll meet me at "Blue Diner"
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing
Baby, at "Blue Diner"
I'll take anything you wanna give me

[Post-Chorus]
Baby

[Verse 2]
I haven't told anyone
Just like we promised, have you?
Every time I drive through the city where you're from
I squeeze a little

[Chorus]
Meet me at "Blue Diner"
I'll take coffee and talk about nothing
Baby, at "Blue Diner"
I'll take anything you wanna give me
You might also like[Bridge]
Baby, at "Blue Diner"
I'll take coffee, talk about nothing
Baby, "Blue Diner"
I'll take anything you wanna give me

[Outro]
Baby
