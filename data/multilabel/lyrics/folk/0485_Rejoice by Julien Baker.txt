All of my friends live in a plastic bag
Walking around, jumping the train tracks
Over the fence, veins all black
Sleep on a bench in the park on my birthday
Call the blue lights, curse Your name
When I find I'm still awake

[Chorus]
Give me everything good and I'll throw it away
I wish I could quit but I can't stand the shakes
Choking to smoke or singing your praise
But I think there's a God and He hears either way
When I rejoice and complain
I never know what to say
But I think there's a God and He hears either way
When I rejoice and complain
Lift my voice that I was made
And somebody's listening at night
With the ghosts of my friends when I pray
Asking, "Why did you let them leave
And then make me stay?"
Know my name and all of my hideous mistakes

[Outro]
I rejoice, I rejoice
I rejoice, I rejoiceYou might also like
