She's asleep in the back seat
Looking peaceful enough to me
But she's wakin' up inside a dream
Full of screeching tires and fire
We're comin' back from where no one lives
Pretty much just veterans
When I pointed out where the North Star is
She called me a fuckin' liar

[Chorus: Bridgers, Dacus & Baker, Bridgers & Dacus, All]
Emily, I'm sorry, I just (Emily, I)
Make it up as I go along
And I can feel myself becoming (I can feel)
Someone only you could want

[Verse 2: Bridgers]
Headed straight for the concrete
In a nightmare, screaming
Now I'm wide awake, spiraling
And you don't wanna talk
Just take me back to Montreal
I'll get a real job, you'll go back to school
We can burn out in the freezing cold
And just get lost
You might also like[Chorus: Bridgers, Dacus & Baker, Bridgers & Dacus, All]
Emily, I'm sorry, baby (Emily, I)
You know how I get when I'm wrong (You know how I get)
And I can feel myself becoming (I can feel)
Somebody I'm not, I'm not, so
Emily, forgive me, can we (Emily, I)
Make it up as we go along?
I'm twenty-seven and I don't know who I am (Don't know who I am)
But I know what I want

[Outro: Bridgers]
Emily, I'm sorry
Emily, I'm sorry
I'm sorry
