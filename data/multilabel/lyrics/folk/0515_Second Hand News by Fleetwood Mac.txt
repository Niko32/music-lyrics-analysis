I know there's nothing to say
Someone has taken my place
When times go bad, when times go rough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?
I know I got nothin' on you
I know there's nothing to do
When times go bad and you can't get enough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?

[Chorus: Lindsey Buckingham]
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow-bow, bow-bow, doo-da-doo-do-do-doo
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-buh-bow
Bow-bow-bow-bow-buh-bow-bow, bow bow, yeah

[Verse 2: Lindsey Buckingham, Lindsey Buckingham & Stevie Nicks]
One thing I think you should know
I ain't gonna miss you when you go
Been down so long, I've been tossed around enough
Oh, couldn't you just
Let me go down and do my stuff?
I know you're hoping to find
Someone who's going to give you peace of mind
When times go bad, when times go rough
Won't you lay me down in the tall grass
And let me do my stuff?
