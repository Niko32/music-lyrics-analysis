Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a river full of memory
Sleep, my darling, safe and sound
For in this river all is found
All is found
When all is lost, then all is found

[Verse 2]
In her waters, deep and true
Lie the answers and a path for you
Dive down deep into her sound
But not too far or you'll be drowned

[Verse 3]
She will sing to those who'll hear
And in her song, all magic flows
But can you brave what you most fear?
Can you face what the river knows?

[Verse 4]
Until the river's finally crossed
You'll never feel the solid ground
You had to get a little lost
On your way to being found
You might also like[Verse 5]
Where the north wind meets the sea
There's a mother full of memory
Come, my darling, homeward bound
Where all is lost, then all is found

[Outro]
All is found
All is found
