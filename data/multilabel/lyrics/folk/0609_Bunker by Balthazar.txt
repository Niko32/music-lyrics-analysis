Every time I walk on by
Stroll along your street
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world
A thing left to repeat

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was walking on your floor
Begging to get more
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world
A thing left to ask for

[Chorus]
So leave my broken bones
I'll take a load of your skin
Throw me all your stones
You need a sinner I'm in (yeah)

[Verse 2]
Every time I walk on by
Stroll along your street
Can't believe there's not a thing in the world
A thing left to repeat

[Chorus]
So leave my broken bones
I'll take a load of your skin
Throw me all your stones
You need a sinner I'm in, (yeah)
So leave my broken bones
I'll take a load of your skin
Throw me all your stones
You need a sinner, I'm in (yeah)

Don't you know
Don't you know what to say
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again

[Outro]
Don't you know
Don't you know where to stay
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again

Don't you know
Don't you know what to say
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again

Don't you know
Don't you know where to stay
Every time you think about it
Talk around it again
