I feel your love
I feel time is up
When I was a child, I never knew enough
What'd that do to me?
The wave of love is a transient hurt
Water’s the shell and we are the knot
But I saw a hand arch out of the barrel

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Look at all the peaches
How do you celebrate?
Can't appear inside of nowhere

[Chorus]
It's already dead
I know you have the dove
I’m not gettin' wet
Looks like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I'm not gettin' led along

[Verse 2]
Rushed in to hold down your page
And now I sleep 'side words you do not read with me
I hear a song from inside the maze, the very one you made
You shook at the ivory mantle
As a poet, I knew to be gentle
When you have a child, so begins the braiding
And in that braid you stay
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Look at all the peaches
I want to celebrate
I can appear inside of nowhere
Look at all the peaches

[Chorus]
It's already dead
I know you have the dove
I'm not getting wet
Looks like a date is set
Show the ferret to the egg
I'm not getting led along

[Bridge]
The wave of love is a transient hurt
Water’s the shell and we are the knot
But I saw a match struck outside the barrel

[Outro]
