I was raised up believing
I was somehow unique
Like a snowflake distinct among snowflakes
Unique in each way you'd conceive
And now after some thinking
I'd say I'd rather be
A functioning cog in some great machinery
Serving something beyond me
But I don't, I don't know what that will be
I'll get back to you someday soon, you will see

[Verse 2]
What's my name? What's my station?
Oh, just tell me what I should do
I don't need to be kind to the armies of night
That would do such injustice to you
Or bow down and be grateful
And say, "Sure, take all that you see"
To the men who move only in dimly lit halls
And determine my future for me
And I don't, I don't know who to believe
I'll get back to you someday soon, you will see

[Verse 3]
If I know only one thing
It's that everything that I see
Of the world outside is so inconceivable
Often, I barely can speak
Yeah, I'm tongue-tied and dizzy
And I can't keep it to myself
What good is it to sing helplessness blues?
Why should I wait for anyone else?
And I know, I know you will keep me on the shelf
I'll come back to you someday soon myself

If I had an orchard, I'd work till I'm raw
If I had an orchard, I'd work till I'm sore
And you would wait tables and soon run the store
Gold hair in the sunlight, my light in the dawn
If I had an orchard, I'd work till I'm sore
If I had an orchard, I'd work till I'm sore
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Someday I'll be like the man on the screen
