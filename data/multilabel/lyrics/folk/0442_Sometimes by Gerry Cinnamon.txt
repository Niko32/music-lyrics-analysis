Sometimes, just sometimes
Maybe more than some of the time
I'm on a false ego trip, insecurity is rife
I'm not the ideal person to be lecturing of life
But if you wanna know
Some things I've learned about myself
Been in sticky situations, I won't bore you with the filth
Breaking bones and sniffing gear
Pouring blood and sweat and tears
In a nutshell, I suppose
It's the way the water flows
Yeah, that's the way the story goes

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, just sometimes
Well alright, maybe all of the time
I'm on a false ego trip
Oh, I'm a renegade of sorts
I roam the concrete jungle hunting idiots for sport
And now the cocaine scene; it picked me up and made me frown
That's when jokies says that music helps the medicine go down
Hey, it makes you feel alive
More like demons of the night
Putting powder up your nose
It's the way the water flows
Yeah, that's the way the story goes

Sometimes
Just sometimes

[Verse 3]
And now the world outside, don't look the same for you and me
Drinking cider on a golf course, just a distant memory
Down the park and pick a fight
Popping pills all through the night
Fucking waster, I suppose
That's the way the water flows
Yeah, that's the way the story goes

[Outro]
Sometimes
Just sometimes
Sometimes
Just sometimes
Just sometimes
