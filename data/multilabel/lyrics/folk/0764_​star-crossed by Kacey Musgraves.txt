Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

[Verse]
Let me set the scene
Two lovers ripped right at the seams
They woke up from the perfect dream
And then the darkness came
I signed the papers yesterday
You came and took your things away
I moved out of the home we made
And gave you back your name

[Chorus]
What have we done?
Did we fly too high just to get burned by the sun?
No one's to blame
'Cause we called all the angels to save us
Called them by name
But I guess they got lost
Star-crossed

[Outro]
(Star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed)
(Star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed)
(Star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed)
(Star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed, star-crossed)
Star-crossed, ah
Ah, star-crossed
Star-crossed, ah
Star-crossed
Star-crossed
