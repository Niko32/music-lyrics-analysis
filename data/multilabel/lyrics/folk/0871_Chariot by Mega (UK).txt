Just imagine, we woke up in paradise
Don't need magic, let my force just carry us home tonight
Future’s golden, don't let go don't give it up
Just keep holding, even when you had enough
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I will be your light

[Chorus]
When you’re low, I'll lead you home, Chariot
Take you back to where you're from, Chariot

[Verse 2]
One step forward, on the road ahead of us
Don't look back, no
You just need a bit of luck
Oh, oh, tonight

[Chorus]
When you're low, I'll lead you home, Chariot
Take you back to where you're from, Chariot
When you're low, I’ll lead you home, Chariot
Take you back to where you’re from, Chariot
