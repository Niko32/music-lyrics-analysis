The distance from the man that I am to the man I want to be
The time it takes to realize time is the distance I need
But I was born impatient, and I was born unkind
But I refuse to believe I have to be the same person I was born when I die
'Cause change is alright
Change is alright

[Verse 2]
I'm not proud of all the choices I've made for a lot of my life
Following the shadow when I damn well know that behind me is the light
But I've lied to my mother, I made people feel like hell
But I refuse to believe I have to keep being cruel 'cause I'm a coward myself

[Verse 3]
And time is impatience, no, patience takes time
Excuses will only do good if you're waiting around to die

[Bridge]
Everyone is born with self worth, how easily it turns to doubt
It takes letting go of what we know we can't live without

[Verse 4]
But the blood in the water is the blood of my brother
We both learned it didn't mean a thing in the end if one was thicker than the other
And I've tried having faith, but I'll rot like a dove
'Cause I've always been scared of loving someone just a little bit more than I'm loved
Losing is fine
Everything is fineYou might also like
