Enthusiastic beyond belief
In a busy room you're all I see
I fear this admiration will be the end of me
blurring the lines between what I want and what I need

[Chorus 1]
Calm down, calm down
Don't let her see how fast your heart is beating
Calm down, calm down
Control your breathing

[Verse 2]
And if you don't want me, well that's just tough luck
I think about you but I know I'm not good enough
Have I built you up too much? Now I can't say
What's on my mind in case I go and scare you away

[Chorus 1]
Calm down, calm down
Don't let her see how fast your heart is beating
Calm down, calm down
Control your breathing

[Verse 3]
All the people you meet
will have thoughts optimistic and sweet
And how can I compete
with the world at your feet
[Chorus 2]
Would it be cruel, be cruel, be cruel
to let my eyes return to you?
Would it be cruel, be cruel, be cruel,
to give my thoughts, my thought to you?

[Verse 4]
Feelings for friends turn to hate
when I see what they are willing to throw away
And now I envy a fool who only negates anything with a deeper meaning he tries to say

[Chorus 2]
Would it be cruel, be cruel, be cruel
to let my eyes return to you?
Would it be cruel, be cruel, be cruel,
to give my thoughts, my thought to you?

[Bridge]
I wouldn't want to hurt you by letting you hurt me
you don't deserve to feel guilty
I'm an overly sensitive impatient little freak
you'd do better to turn your back on me
Why do I think these stupid thoughts?
I want to fight my own advice
For I will only feel remorse
I just want you in my life
