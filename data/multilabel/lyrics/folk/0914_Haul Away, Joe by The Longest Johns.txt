When I was just a little lad, or so me Mammi told me
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe
That if I didn't kiss the girls me lips would grow all mouldy
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe

Away! HO! Haul away, we'll haul away together
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe
Away! HO! Haul away, we'll hope for better weather
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe

I used to have an Irish girl but she got fat and lazy
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe
But now I've got a Bristol girl and she just drives me crazy
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe

[Chorus]
Away! HO! Haul away, we'll haul away together
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe
Away! HO! Haul away, we'll hope for better weather
Away Haul Away, we'll haul away, Joe

Then he got his head chopped off & it spoiled his constitut-i-on
