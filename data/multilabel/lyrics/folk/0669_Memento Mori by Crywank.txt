Everyone I love is gonna die
And I will die as well
I think about this before I sleep
And have since I was a child
In my life, will I make a difference?
In my death, will I be missed?
Will I be granted some sort of an afterlife?
Or will I just cease to exist?
This fear makes me feel so na√Øve
I wish that I could just accept
But I'm chilled by the redundancy of
Thoughts collected, but not kept
And maybe I'm still a stupid, little boy
Too weak to understand what will come
I want to find peace of mind
Maybe no mind is the answer to that conundrum

[Pre-Refrain]
And oh, I want to be a baby again
Oh, I want pure thoughts in my head
Oh, I want to be a baby again
Oh, I want pure thoughts in my head
You might also like[Refrain]
Oh, I want to be a baby again
Oh, I want to forget
Oh, I want to be a baby again
Oh, I want pure thoughts in my head
Oh, I want to be a baby again
Oh, I want to forget
Oh, I want to be a baby again
Oh, I want pure thoughts in my head
Oh, I want to be a baby again
Oh, I want to forget

[Outro]
Everyone I love is gonna die
And I will die as well
I think about this before I sleep
And have since I was a child
