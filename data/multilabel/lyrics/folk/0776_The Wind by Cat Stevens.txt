I listen to the wind, to the wind of my soul
Where I'll end up, well, I think only God really knows

[Chorus]
I've sat upon the settin' sun
But never, never, never, never
I never wanted water once
No, never, never, never

[Verse 2]
I listen to my words, but they fall far below
I let my music take me where my heart wants to go

[Chorus]
I've swam upon the devil's lake
But never, never, never, never
I'll never make the same mistake
No, never, never, neverYou might also like
