Motorcars, handlebars, bicycles for two
Broken-hearted jubilee
Parachutes, army boots, sleeping bags for two
Sentimental jamboree

[Chorus]
"Buy! Buy!" says the sign in the shop window
"Why? Why?" says the junk in the yard

[Verse 2]
Da-da-ya-da-da-da-da-da-ya, da-da-ya, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da, da-da
Candlesticks, building bricks, something old and new
Memories for you and me

[Chorus]
"Buy! Buy!" says the sign in the shop window
"Why? Why?" says the junk in the yardYou might also like
