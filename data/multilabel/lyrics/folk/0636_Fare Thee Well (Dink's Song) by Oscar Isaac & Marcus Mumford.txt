I'd fly up the river to the one I love
Fare thee well my honey fare thee well
Well I had a man who was long and tall
Who moved his body like a cannon ball
Fare thee well my honey fare thee well
I remember one evening in the pouring rain
In my heart was an aching pain
Fare thee well my honey fare thee well
Bloody river was muddy and wild
Can't give a bloody for my unborn child
Fare thee well my honey fare thee well
Sure as a bird flying high above
Life ain't worth living without the one you love
Fare thee well my honey fare thee well

Fare thee well my honey fare thee wellYou might also like
