My sandpaper sigh engraves a line
Into the rust of your tongue
Girl, I could've been someone to you
Would have painted the skies blue

[Chorus]
Baby blue
If you knew
Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue

[Verse 2]
Edging closer, you swing my way
Girl, I've got no chance and nothing to say
Girl, but stay here for a little while

[Chorus]
Baby blue
Baby blue
Baby blue

[Verse 3]
But if only you could see
My shadow crossing your path
It won't be the last, baby blue
You might also like[Chorus]
You are my baby
You are my baby
I was your slave, can't you see?
I was your slave, can't you see?

[Outro]
Bobbing on the problem
On the problem, on the throbbing
She was falling, I was bawling
My heart was stopping, she was throbbing, oh
