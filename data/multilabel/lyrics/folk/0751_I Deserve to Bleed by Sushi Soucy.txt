I wanna rip out my intestines, throw them in the sea
I wanna raise the money to invest in plastic surgery
I wanna cover myself head to toe in super sexy scars
'Cause I mean, aren't you supposed to burn if you're a star?

[Chorus]
I want to be torn apart excruciatingly
I punish my body 'cause it's not good enough for me
The scary thoughts are spreading like a weed
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed

[Verse 2]
I wanna take a knife and draw a line across my chest
I wanna feel much better than I do when I am at my best
I wanna fly away from my own skin and find a better place
I wanna slash across what used to be my face

[Chorus]
I want to be torn apart excruciatingly
I punish my body 'cause it's not good enough for me
The scary thoughts are spreading like a weed
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed

[Bridge]
They say that it gets better, but I guess that was a lie
I guess we all just fake it 'til we die
Sympathy and love we can extend to someone else
But it's harder when you have to love yourself
You might also like[Chorus]
I want to be torn apart excruciatingly
I punish my body 'cause it's not good enough for me
The scary thoughts are spreading like a weed
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed
The thoughts that say that I deserve to bleed
