I don't mind if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there
We can go if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there

We can go to the Chateau Marmont
And dance in the hotel room
We can run with the headlights on
Until we got nothing to lose

[Post-Chorus: Angus Stone]
We high, lifting from the ground
We go, never coming down
I don't mind if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there

[Verse: Julia Stone]
Every day the weekend, trying to be your best friend
Trying just to figure it out
Corner in your converse, living on the outskirts
Trying just to figure it out
Talking like a deadbeat, I just wanted you to see
Everything that I could see
Walking in the night sky, I'm always on your side
You were really saving me
You might also like[Chorus: Angus Stone]
We can go to the Chateau Marmont
And dance in the hotel room
We can go to the Chateau Marmont
And dance, we got nothing to lose
I don't mind if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there
We can go if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there

[Post-Chorus: Angus Stone]
We high, lifting from the ground
We go, never coming down
I don't mind if you wanna go anywhere
I'll take you there
I'll take you there
I'll take you there

[Bridge: Angus & Julia, Angus Stone, Julia Stone]
Throw me a bone
Don't be scared of what you don't already know
Throw me a bone
Don't be scared of what you don't already know
Throw me a bone
Don't be scared of what you don't already know
Throw me a bone
Don't be scared of what you don't already know
Throw me a bone
(Don't go wasting your time)
Don't be scared of what you don't already know
Throw me a bone
(Don't go wasting your time)
Don't be scared of what you don't already know
Throw me a bone
(Don't go wasting your time)
Don't be scared of what you don't already know
Throw me a bone
(Don't go wasting your time)
Don't be scared of what you don't already know
[Outro: Angus Stone]
Don't go wasting your time
Don't go wasting your time
