Hey babe
What do you expect me to say?
I could tell you that I'm doing great
But darling, I'm just not okay

[Verse 2]
Hey babe
Why did we throw it away?
Without you I just ain't the same
And darling, I'm just not okay

[Humming]

[Verse 3]
Hey babe
I've been putting on my bravest face
Just looking for ways to replace you
And darling, I'm just not okay

[Verse 4]
Hey babe
It isn't like me to complain
But you don't look at me the same
And darling, I'm just not okay
You might also like[Humming]

[Verse 1]
Hey babe
What do you expect me to say?
I could tell you that I'm doing great
But darling, I'm just not okay
