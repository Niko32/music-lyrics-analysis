On the on-ramp, you said
"If you love me, you will listen to this song"
And I could tell that you were serious
So I didn't tell you you were driving the wrong way
On the interstate until the song was done
You felt like an idiot adding an hour to the drive
But it gave us more time to embarrass ourselves
Tellin' stories we wouldn't tell anyone else

[Chorus: All, Dacus]
You said, "I might like you less now that you know me so well"
I might like you less now that you know me so well
[Verse 2: Dacus]
Leonard Cohen once said
"There's a crack in everything, that's how the light gets in"
And I am not an old man having an existential crisis
At a Buddhist monastery writing horny poetry
But I agree

[Chorus: Dacus, All]
I never thought you'd happen to me
I never thought you'd happen to meYou might also like
