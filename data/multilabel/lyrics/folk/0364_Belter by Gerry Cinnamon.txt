She is a belter, different from the rest
Diamonds oan' her finger and she always looks her best
She is a gangster, with a hundred-mile stare
When she walks her feet don’t touch the flare'
She is a belter

[Verse 2]
She plays wae' lightning, I’m a hundred miles high
Dishing out the thunder like a god inside the sky
She is a dancer and she dances in my dreams
Reminds me that the world is not as evil as it seems
She is a belter

[Chorus]
No happy endings, unless fairy-tales come true
But she looks like a princess and there’s not much else to do
I think I love her
She gets underneath my skin
But I’ve been stung a few times, so I don't let no one in
No even belter

[Refrain]
She is a belter
She is a belter
She is a belter
You might also like[Verse 3]
How can she reach me when I’m high above the shelf?
Lost inside a smoke ring while I ponder tae' myself
Is she the answer, tae the question in my mind?
Is happiness an option, or has love just turned me blind?
Is she a belter?

[Chorus]
No happy endings; unless fairy-tales come true
But she looks like a princess and there’s not much else to do
I think I love her
She gets underneath my skin
But I’ve been stung a few times, so I don't let no one in
No even belter

[Outro]
She is a belter
She is a belter
She is a belter
