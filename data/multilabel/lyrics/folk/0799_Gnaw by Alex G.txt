And you were cryin' loud, right out in the schoolyard
And, yeah, I felt good
Everything I knew was looking just as it should
I saw the tree
Carved in it "666" and he found me
But I am no fool
I know every time I look in his eyes, he sees me too
Dry your eyes
I won't tell your mother
She won't ever discover
The things you kept under the covers
And please don't cry
I am not your brother
I am not your lover
And there is nothing wrongYou might also like
