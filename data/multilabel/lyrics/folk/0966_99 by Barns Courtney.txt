Heartstrung, young and dumb
Yeah, we had no fear
Way back when we said
We'd both be millionaires
Now those days are over
And we are all ghosts

[Pre-Chorus]
We used to sleep all day and talk all night
Stay up by the TV light (Oh, oh)
When your baby teeth ain't milky white
Wipe the stardust from your eyes (Oh, oh)
I said "Oh, come on, love, we'll be just fine
We're gonna live just like it's 1999"

[Chorus]
In nineteen-ninety–
In nineteen-ninety-nine
In nineteen-ninety–
In nineteen-ninety-nine

[Verse 2]
Back then we were trading
Cards behind the swings
Oh no, now it's money, gold, and diamond rings
Now those days are over
And we are all ghosts
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
We used to sleep all day and talk all night
Stay up by the TV light (Oh, oh)
When your baby teeth ain't milky white
Wipe the stardust from your eyes (Oh, oh)
I said "oh come on love, we'll be just fine
We're gonna live just like it's nineteen-ninety-nine"

[Chorus]
In nineteen-ninety–
In nineteen-ninety-nine
In nineteen-ninety–
In nineteen-ninety-nine

[Bridge]
Oh, oh no, where does it go?
Well, whatever fill your body up with chemicals
Oh, oh no, kaleidoscopes
Well, whatever living better in

[Chorus]
In nineteen-ninety–
In nineteen-ninety-nine
In nineteen-ninety–
In nineteen-ninety-nine
[Outro]
Nintendo, Atari
Sega's my Ferrari
I got it, I love it, I, I–
In nineteen-ninety–
Got Sony electronics
Voodoo economics
I got it, I love it, I, I–
In nineteen-ninety-nine
