My love she speaks like silence
Without ideals or violence
She doesn't have to say she's faithful
Yet she's true, like ice, like fire

[Verse 2]
People carry roses
And make promises by the hours
My love she laughs like the flowers
Valentines can't buy her

[Verse 3]
In the dime stores and bus stations
People talk of situations
Read books, repeat quotations
Draw conclusions on the wall

[Verse 4]
Some speak of the future
My love she speaks softly
She knows there's no success like failure
And that failure's no success at all

[Verse 5]
The cloak and dagger dangles
Madams light the candles
In ceremonies of the horsemen
Even a pawn must hold a grudge
You might also like[Verse 6]
Statues made of match sticks
Crumble into one another
My love winks, she does not bother
She knows too much to argue or to judge

[Verse 7]
The bridge at midnight trembles
The country doctor rambles
Bankers' nieces seek perfection
Expecting all the gifts that wise men bring

[Verse 8]
The wind howls like a hammer
The night blows rainy
My love she's like some raven
At my window with a broken wing
