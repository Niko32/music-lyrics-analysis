Once upon a time in Hollywood
When Carole called my name
I stood up, the room exploded, and I
Knew that's it, I'll never be the same
That's when the doors swung open
And a voice said, "We're glad you came"
Now I've spent thousands on you, darling
All the hotels and the jets
And I'd pay it all again to have your golden body back in my bed
But I don't miss the poison arrows aimed directly at my head

[Pre-Chorus]
Goodbye to all the bottles, all the models
Bye to the clouds in thе skies that all hold no rain

[Chorus]
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California lovе

[Verse 2]
Oh, once upon a time, the Canyon store
Was where my world began
All that mystery and beauty gleaned from desert flowers and gifted children
But it got hard to grow up with your cool hand around my neck
Now in my hometown, sunbathing
My girlfriends and my baby
But every time I smell tequila
The garden grows up in my mind again
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Goodbye to all the bottles, all the models
Bye to the kids in the lines for the new Supreme

[Chorus]
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love
Don't want that California love

[Outro]
(Hmm) It's just a dream
(Hmm) It's just a dream
(Hmm) It's all just a dream
(Hmm) I wanna wake up, I wanna wake up
