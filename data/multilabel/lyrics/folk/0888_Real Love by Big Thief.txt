Having a bad week?
Let me touch your cheek
I will always love you

[Verse 2]
Having your face hit
Having your lip split
By the one who loves you

[Chorus]
Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack

[Verse 3]
Showing your mother to any other
Letting them touch her
Looking up to her
Watching her do her makeup and hair

[Chorus]
Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black
Real love is a heart attack
You might also like[Verse 4]
Cry like a bird, fly like a baby
Mama got drunk and Daddy went crazy
If your speech slurs, if you feel shaky, meet me out back
I'll be there waiting

[Verse 5]
Riding in the back seat
Watching the spit fly and the hummingbird cry
Oh mama, oh papa
Oh mama, oh papa
How much blood is worth the draw?
How much blood is worth the draw?

[Chorus]
Real love, real love
Real love makes your lungs black

[Guitar Solo #1]

Hummingbird watching
Watching her young thing
Grow up so fast
Looking up to her
Watching her do her makeup and hair
