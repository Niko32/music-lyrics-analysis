I'd like to walk all over the things you say to me
I'd like to run and jump on your solitude
I'd like to rearrange your latitude to me

You say you just want peace and to never hurt anyone
You see the end before the beginning has ever begun
I would disturb your easy tranquillity
I'd turn away the sad impossibility of your smile

I'd sit there in the sun of the things I like about you
I'd sing my songs and find out just what they mean to you
But most of all I'd like you to be unaware
Then I'd just wander away, trailing palm leaves behind me
So you don't even know that I've been thereYou might also like
