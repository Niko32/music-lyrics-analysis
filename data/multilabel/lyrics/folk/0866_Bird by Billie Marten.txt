She’s underwater again
Somebody’s daughter, a friend
In the night in the dark in the cold
As she walks far away

[Chorus]
Nobody’s watching
Drowning in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free

[Post-Chorus]
I don’t mind

[Verse 2]
Hope is a distance unreached
Ink on her skin incomplete
And the faint sound of friends
As she neared to the end she had peace

[Chorus]
Nobody’s watching
Drowning in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
I don’t mind
I don’t mind

[Bridge]
Where does a star go from here?
Lost in the grip

[Chorus]
Nobody’s watching
Drowning in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free
Nobody’s watching
Drowning in words so sweet
Mild is the water
Caught as a bird once free

[Post-Chorus]
I don’t mind
I don’t mind
I don’t mind
I don’t mind
