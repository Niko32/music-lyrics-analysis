I feel like a leech to everyone around me
Unsure and false promises I make
I invade your existence with my dependence
And leave you guilt tripped until you take
Care of me, for If not I will surely die
I don’t feed or clean myself and I am always high
Putting pipe dreams before the necessities in life
Without your help I have no hope to survive
Now I know that sounds pathetic
That’s because that’s what I am
So open about my flaws
But it’s all part of my plan
For if I can recognize my flaws
You’ll assume I’m trying to change
But I am lazy and disheartened
And I know I will remain the same
Taking all you can give me trying to live in excess
You know you’ll make my life much easier, I’ll make your life a mess
Squirm away stupid leech boy go and die now in the drain
You speak only of your sadness but are yet to feel true pain

[Chorus]
As I get older I also worsen
I used to be a better person
Growing into a constant burden
Introducing man child

I am scared I’ll lose my job because I always go in stoned
If I do will you feed me, take me in and hear me moan
If you don’t I’m on your conscience and will surely die alone
Invite me in to regret it as I take over your home
Oh so useless and demanding no I will not help out with chores
I’ll bring no money or conversation. Unmotivated and bored
Staring blankly into space absorbing all you have worked for
I will disappoint those who think I can do more
I warn you now to avoid me
I may not bite the hand that feeds
But I will wrap my lips around it
And I will suck off all the meat
You’ll be left feeling used once you find out I’m a leech
I’ve taken all you can give and now I will up and leave
No shame or dignity left in me as I scout out brand new friends
To invade with my dependence and let it start again

[Chorus]
As I get older I also worsen
I used to be a better person
Growing into a constant burden
Introducing man child
