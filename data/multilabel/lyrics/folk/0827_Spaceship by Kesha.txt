I always said
When I'm gone, when I’m dead
Don't lay me down with the dirt on my head
You won't need a shovel, you don’t need a cold headstone
You don't need to cry, I'm gon' be going home

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for my spaceship to come back to me
It's coming back to me
I don't really care if you believe it's coming back for me, yeah
I’m living in a lonesome galaxy
But in my dreams, I see ’em come and rescue me
Look up in the sky and there they'll be
Bet you’ll think of me then

[Post-Chorus]
Gonna say, "Ooh"
"Look at that, oh yeah, yeah"
Damn, if it ain't true
They're coming back for me
They're coming back for me, yeah

[Verse 2]
I knew from the start
I don’t belong in these parts
There's too much hate, there's too much hurt for this heart
Lord knows this planet feels like a hopeless place
Thank God I'm going back home to outer space
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm waiting for my spaceship to come back to me
It's coming back to me
I don't really care if you believe it's coming back for me, yeah
I'm living in a lonesome galaxy
But in my dreams, I see 'em come and rescue me
Look up in the sky and there they'll be
Bet you'll think of me then

[Post-Chorus]
Gonna say, "Ooh"
"Look at that, oh yeah, yeah"
Damn, if it ain't true
They're coming back for me
They're coming back for me, yeah

[Bridge]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
(Ah)

[Chorus]
I'm waiting for my spaceship to come back for me
And I don't really care if you believe me
Oh, I been living in a lonesome galaxy
But in my dreams, I see 'em come and rescue me
Look up in the sky and there they'll be
I bet you'll think of me then
[Post-Chorus]
Gonna say, "Ooh"
"Look at that, oh yeah, yeah"
Damn, if it ain't true
They're coming back for me
They're coming back for me, yeah

[Outro]
As I leave this Earth and sail into the infinite cosmic universe, the wars, the triumphs, the beauty, and the bloodshed, the ocean of human endeavor, it all grows quiet, insignificant. I'm nothing more than recycled stardust and borrowed energy, born from a rock spinning in the ether. I watch my life backwards and forwards and I feel free. Nothing is real, love is everything, and I know nothing.
