Breathin' in, breathin' out
How you been? You settled down?
You feelin' right? You feelin' proud?
How are your kids? Where are they now?

[Pre-Chorus]
You build a boat, you build a life
You lose your friends, you lose your wife
You settle in to routine
Where are you? What does it mean?

[Chorus]
If I get too close and I'm not how you hoped
Forgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised out in the cold
If the sun don't rise 'til the summertime
Forgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised on little light

[Verse 2]
Bought some shit, search online
You're gettin' lost, you're gettin' high
All alone late in life
Scared to live, scared to die

[Pre-Chorus]
You build a boat, you build a life
You lose your kids, you lose your wife
You settle down, you're feelin' lost
You're gettin' stoned, then kickin' rocks (One, two, three, four)

If I get too close and I'm not how you hoped
Forgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised out in the cold
If the sun don't rise 'til the summertime
Forgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised on little light

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-ah (Oh)
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah-ah (Oh)

[Chorus]
If I get too close and I'm not how you hoped
Forgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised out in the cold
If the sun don't shine 'til the summertime
Forgive my northern attitude, oh, I was raised on little light

[Outro]
Sick
