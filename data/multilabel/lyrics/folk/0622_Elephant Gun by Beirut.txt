[Verse 1]
If I was young, I'd flee this town
I'd burn my dreams underground
As did I, we drink to die, we drink tonight
Far from home, elephant guns
Let's take them down one by one
We'll lay it down, it's not been found, it's not around

[Verse 2]
Let the seasons begin
It rolls right on
Let the seasons begin
Take the big game down
Let the seasons begin
It rolls right on
Let the seasons begin
Take the big game down

[Bridge]
Elephant, elephant gun
Elephant, elephant gun
Elephant, elephant gun
Elephant, elephant gun

And it rips through the silence of our camp at night
And it rips through the night, all night, all night
And it rips through the silence of our camp at night
And it rips through the silence, all that is left is all that I hide
[Part 2]
