Didn't wanna ask our friend if you were gonna be here
And make the whole thing weird
But I was nervous in the car just in case you are
Just in case the coast ain't clear
And I'm looking over people's shoulders
And that's fucked up, I know that

[Verse 2]
And I just had this vision of you looking at me different
When you saw this dress
But I'd have one drink and I'd say the wrong thing
So it's probably for the best
And I'm looking over peoples' shoulders
And I'm hoping that you're somewhere close

[Chorus]
But everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
You're the only one I wanna run into
But I never do
Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
I don't wanna search for you in every room
But I always do
You might also like[Verse 3]
I got in last night, staying on the west side
Scotty told me you're here
And I'm having these thoughts, did we fuck it up or not?
Did we waste two years?
And did you get the space you needed?
Did you realize you don't need me?
Hey, did you realize you don't need me?

[Chorus]
Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
You're the only one I wanna run into
But I never do
Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you
Don't wanna search for you in every room
But I always do
Everyone at this party isn't you
Everyone at this party isn't you

[Outro]
Hey, did you realize you don't need me?
