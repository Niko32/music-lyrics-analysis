Oh, I have all my fingers
The knife goes chop chop chop
If I miss the spaces in-between my fingers will come off
And if I hit my fingers
The blood will soon come out
But all the same I play this game 'cause that's what it's all about
Oh, chop chop chop chop chop chop
I'm picking up the speed
And if I hit my fingers then my hand will start to bleedYou might also like
