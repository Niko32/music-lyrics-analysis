When they poured across the border
I was cautioned to surrender
This I could not do
I took my gun and vanished

[Verse 2]
I have changed my name so often
I've lost my wife and children
But I have many friends
And some of them are with me

[Verse 3]
An old woman gave us shelter
Kept us hidden in the garret
Then the soldiers came
She died without a whisper

[Verse 4]
There were three of us this morning
I'm the only one this evening
But I must go on
The frontiers are my prison

[Verse 5]
Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come
Then we'll come from the shadows

Les Allemands étaient chez moi
Ils me dirent, "Resigne-toi,"
Mais je n'ai pas pu
J'ai repris mon arme

[Verse 7]
J'ai changé cent fois de nom
J'ai perdu femme et enfants
Mais j'ai tant d'amis
J'ai la France entière

[Verse 8]
Un vieil homme dans un grenier
Pour la nuit nous a caché
Les Allemands l'ont pris
Il est mort sans surprise

[Verse 5]
Oh, the wind, the wind is blowing
Through the graves the wind is blowing
Freedom soon will come
Then we'll come from the shadows
