But you can't lie to me with all these books that you sell
I'm not trying to follow you to the end of the world
I'm just trying to leave something behind

Words have come from men and mouse
But I can't help thinking that I've heard the wrong crowd
When all the water is gone my job will be too
And I'm trying to leave something behind

Oh money is free but love costs more than our bread
And the ceiling is hard to reach
Oh the future ahead is broken and red
But I'm trying to leave something behind

This whole world is a foreign land
We swallow the moon but we don't know our own hand
We're running with the case but we ain't got the gold
Yet we're trying to leave something behind

My friends I believe we are at the wrong fight
And I cannot read what I did not write
I've been to His house, but the master is gone
But I'd like to leave something behind

There is a beast who has taken my brain
You can put me to bed but you can't feel my pain
When the machine has taken the soul from the man
It's time to leave something behind
You might also likeOh money is free but love costs more than our bread
And the ceiling is hard to reach
Oh the future ahead is already dead
So I'm trying to leave something behind

I got this feeling that I'm still at the shore
And pockets don't know what it means to be poor
I can get through the wall if you give me a door
So I can leave something behind

Oh wisdom is lost in the trees somewhere
You're not going to find it in some mental gray hair
It's locked up from those who hurry ahead
And it's time to leave something behind

Oh money is free but love costs more than our bread
And the ceiling is hard to reach
When my son is a man he will know what I meant
I was just trying to leave something behind
I was just trying to leave something behind
