I was alone for a while
You came along and you asked me for a smile
I guess then the stars had aligned
A flower bloomed
The clouds were rushing out of my mind

[Verse 2]
And that's how it goes in the films
Tears of honeysuckle welling up in your eyes
A boy meets a girl, they go off to beat the world
And they both are left unsatisfied

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, lovesick boys will write you love songs
And lovesick girls will always listen
But what you fail to see is there's plenty of us
So keep your petals pointing towards the sun

[Chorus]
And bloom, bloom, bloom
Just bloom, just bloom

[Verse 3]
You watch as he walks through the fields
Crushing pretty daisies under his heavy heels
He picks you a big one, it withers in the sun
You notice that the flower is you
You might also like[Verse 4]
And I know that he has the charm
To sweep you off your feet and wrap you around his arm
But he hurts you like crazy
He loves you, well maybe
But you are so much better than you know that you are

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause lovesick boys will write you love songs
And lovesick girls will always listen
But what you fail to see is there's plenty of us
So keep your petals pointing towards the sun

[Chorus]
And bloom, bloom, bloom
Just bloom, just bloom, just bloom
