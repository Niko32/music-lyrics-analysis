Clouds are marching along
Singing a song, just like they do
If the clouds were singing a song
I'd sing along, wouldn't you, too?
If you just knew what they could do
Oh, if you just knew, what would they do?

[Pre-Chorus]
And if the birds are just hollow words
Flying along, singing a song
What would they do
If they just knew what they could do?
Oh, if they just knew

[Chorus]
I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
No, it never gave a damn about me

[Post-Chorus]
I know it's mad, but if I go to hell
Will you come with me or just leave?
I know it's mad, but if the world were ending
Would you kiss me or just leave me?
Just leave me?

Clouds are singing a song
Marching along, just like they do
If the clouds were playing a song
I'd play along, wouldn't you, too?
If you just knew what they could do
Oh, if you just knew, what would they do?

[Pre-Chorus]
And if words are just hollow birds
Flying along, singing a song
What would they do
If they just knew what we could do?
Oh, if they just knew

[Chorus]
I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
No, it never gave a damn about me

[Post-Chorus]
I know it's mad, but if I go to hell (I know it's mad)
Will you come with me or just leave?
I know it's mad, but if the world were ending (I know it's mad)
Would you kiss me or just leave me?
Just leave me?
[Chorus]
I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me
I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me (I know it's sad)
I know it's sad that I never gave a damn about the weather
And it never gave a damn about me (I know it's oh so sad)
No, it never gave a damn about me (Oh so sad)
