Tell him what you want and, baby, he can find you
Anything you need, tell him what you're needing
Oh
Come on, miracle aligner, go and get 'em, tiger
Get down on your knees, get down on your knees again
Oh

[Verse 1]
Fifty feet tall and revved up too high
All of our exchanges are by candlelight
I just realised
He'll walk through the walls and creep up behind
Make sense of the maze that you were stuck outside
Cover your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
Often the humble kind, but he can't deny
He was born to blow your mind
Or something along those lines
Tonight

[Chorus]
Tell him what you want and, baby, he can find you
Anything you need, tell him what you're needing
Oh
Come on, miracle aligner, go and get 'em, tiger
Get down on your knees, get down on your knees again
Oh
You might also like[Verse 2]
So what's the wish? He'll make it come true
Simple as a line out of a doo-wop tune
He'll make the moves

[Pre-Chorus]
Often the humble kind, but he can't deny
He was born to blow your mind
Or something along those lines
Tonight

[Chorus]
Tell him what you want and, baby, he can find you
Anything you need, tell him what you're needing
Oh
Come on, miracle aligner, go and get 'em, tiger
Get down on your knees, get down on your knees again
Oh
