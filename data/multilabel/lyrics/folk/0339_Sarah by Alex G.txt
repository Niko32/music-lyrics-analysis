And clear her head
Do you know what Sarah meant
When she said, "You be my guest"?
And keep the pace to save your face
You'll never make the place
Why do you even run the race?
I can't be what you need
I am stuck in a dream
I am stuck in a dream
Don't you know
She's been here all along in a dream?
She belongs in a dream
Every day I'll make promises that plague Sarah's heart
So I can watch her fall apart
'Cause I know when I break her down
We'll spit on all the happy clowns
That live around this sunny town
She loves me like a dog (Doo-doo)
And when we mess around (Doo-doo)
I'll let her know the truth I found (Doo-doo, doo-doo)
In my own hopeless hate (Doo-doo)
And every time I wake (Doo-doo)
I second guess the game I played (Doo-doo)
Did I make a mistake?You might also like
