I'm beautiful, I know 'cause it's the season
But what am I to do with all this beauty?
Biology, I am an organism, I'm chemical
That's all, that is all

[Chorus]
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life, I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe about to fall, capture me

[Verse 2]
Or at least take my picture
崩れてゆく前に
I'm pulsing, my blood is red and unafraid of living
Beginning to end

[Chorus]
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life, I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe about to fall

[Bridge]
How I feel this river rushing through my veins
With nowhere else to go, it circles 'round
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
And feel my skin is plump and full of life, I'm in my prime
I'm liquid smooth, come touch me, too
I'm at my highest peak, I'm ripe about to fall, capture me
