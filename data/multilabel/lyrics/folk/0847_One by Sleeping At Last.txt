Hold on for a minute
'Cause I believe that we can fix this over time
That every imperfection is a lie
Or at least an interruption ...
Now hold on, let me finish
No, I'm not saying perfect exists in this life
But we'll only know for certain if we try

[Chorus]
I want to sing a song worth singing
I'll write an anthem worth repeating
I want to feel the transformation
A melody of reformation

[Verse 2]
But the list goes on forever
Of all the ways I could be better, in my mind
As if I could earn God's favor given time
Or at least "congratulations" ...
Now, I have learned my lesson;
The price of this so-called perfection is everything
I've spent my whole life searching desperately
To find out that grace requires nothing of me
[Chorus]
I want to sing a song worth singing
I'll write an anthem worth repeating
I want to feel the transformation
A melody of reformation

[Outro]
I'll hold it all more loosely
And yet somehow much more dearly
'Cause I've spent my whole life searching desperately
To find out that grace requires nothing
Grace requires nothing of me
