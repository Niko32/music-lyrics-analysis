There you are with your college friends
You played in a marching band
I can't help but wish I knew you then
But I guess I know you now

[Pre-Chorus]
It looks as if I've stumbled right into the palm of your hand

[Chorus]
Hey, you
Hey, Mr. Knock On My Door
I'm sorry that I've been emotions galore
Am I crazy for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you
This feeling's hard to ignore
Please say you'll never get bored
Can you blame me for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you

[Verse 2]
Say that it's the same
Take a drill right to my brain
Oh the way you did just yesterday
I guess I get it now
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It looks as if I've stumbled right into the palm of your hand

[Chorus]
Hey, you
Hey, Mr. Knock On My Door
I'm sorry that I've been emotions galore
Am I crazy for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you
This feeling's hard to ignore
Please say you'll never get bored
Can you blame me for wanting a little bit more?
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you

[Outro]
Hey yeah, hey yeah, yeah
(A little more of you)
Hey yeah, hey yeah, yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah, yeah
A little more of you
A little more, a little more of you
