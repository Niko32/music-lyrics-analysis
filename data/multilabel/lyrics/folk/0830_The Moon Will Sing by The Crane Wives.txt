Tell me once again
I could have been anyone, anyone else
Before you made the choice for me
My feet knew the path
We walked in the dark, in the dark
I never gave a single thought to where it might lead
(Ooh, ooh)

[Verse 2]
All those empty rooms
We could have been anywhere, anywhere else
Instead I made a bed with apathy
My heart knew the weight
Ten years' worth of dust and neglect
We made our peace with weariness and let it be
(Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
The moon will sing a song for me
I loved you like the sun
Bore the shadows that you made
With no light of my own

[Post-Chorus]
I shine only with the light you gave me
I shine only with the light you gave me
You might also like[Verse 3]
Name your courage now
We could have had anything, anything else
Instead you hoarded all that's left of me
Swallowing your doubt
Like swords to the pit of my belly
I want to feel the fire that you kept from me
(Ooh, ooh)

[Chorus]
The moon will sing a song for me
I loved you like the sun
Bore the shadows that you made
With no light of my own

[Post-Chorus]
I shine only with the light you gave me
I shine only with the light you gave me
I shine only with the light you gave me
(I could have been anyone, anyone)
I shine only with the light you gave me
(I could have been anyone, anyone)
