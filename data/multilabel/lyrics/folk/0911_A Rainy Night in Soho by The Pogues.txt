I've been loving you a long time
Down all the years, down all the days
And I've cried for all your troubles
Smiled at your funny little ways

[Verse 2]
We watched our friends grow up together
And we saw them as they fell
Some of them fell into Heaven
Some of them fell into Hell

[Verse 3]
I took shelter from a shower
And I stepped into your arms
On a rainy night in Soho
The wind was whistling all its charms

[Verse 4]
I sang you all my sorrows
You told me all your joys
Whatever happened to that old song?
To all those little girls and boys

[Verse 5]
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
The ginger lady by my bed
Covered in a cloak of silence
I hear you talking in my head
You might also like[Verse 6]
I'm not singing for the future
I'm not dreaming of the past
I'm not talking of the first time
I never think about the last

[Verse 7]
Now this song is nearly over
We may never find out what it means
Still there's a light I hold before me
And you're the measure of my dreams, the measure of my dreams

[Verse 5]
Sometimes I wake up in the morning
The ginger lady by my bed
Covered in a cloak of silence
I hear you talking in my head

[Verse 6]
I'm not singing for the future
I'm not dreaming of the past
I'm not talking of the first time
I never think about the last

[Verse 7]
Now this song is nearly over
We may never find out what it means
Still there's a light I hold before me
And you're the measure of my dreams, the measure of my dreams
