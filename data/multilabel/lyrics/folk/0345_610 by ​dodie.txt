I feel like a six out of ten
I've gotta get up early tomorrow again

[Pre-Chorus]
What goes on behind the words?
Is there pity for the plain girl?

[Verse 2]
Can you see the panic inside?
I'm making you uneasy, aren't I?

[Chorus]
What goes on behind the words?
Is there pity for the plain girl?
I'll close my mouth, I won't say a word
A nod of pity for the plain girl

[Bridge]
I know that you don't want me here
I know that you don't want me here
I know that you don't want me here
I know that you don't want me here
I know that you don't want me here
Oh I'll just call a taxi (I know that you don't want me here)
I gotta get up early tomorrow again (I know that you don't want me here)
Oh I'll just call a taxi (I know that you don't want me here)
I gotta get up early tomorrow again (I know that you don't want me here)

What goes on behind the words?
(I know that you don't want me here)
(I gotta get up early tomorrow again)
Is there pity for the plain girl?
(I know that you don't want me here)
(I gotta get up early tomorrow again)
I'll close my mouth, I won't say a word
(I know that you don't want me here)
(I gotta get up early tomorrow again)
A nod of pity for the plain girl
