It was a fun, strange summer
I rolled on, didn't think of you
We lost touch with each other
Fall came and I had to move

[Pre-Chorus]
Movin' backwards, hurt comes after
Healin' doesn't happen in a straight line

[Chorus]
If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle
If I hate you and I love you, and then I change my mind
If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact
That you shoulda treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
Mm, mm
I'm more than just a little justified

[Verse 2]
To touch somebody
You know I tried to make that you
And when you lied, said you didn't want me
Tell me, what was I supposed to do?

[Pre-Chorus]
Movin' onwards, feelin' strong, but
Healin' doesn't happen in a straight line
You might also like[Chorus]
If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle
If I hate you and I love you, and then I change my mind
If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact
That you shoulda treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
Mm, mm
I'm more than just a little justified

[Bridge]
If I die just a little, inside just a little
If I want you and I call you, then I change my mind
If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact
That I shoulda treated you right
I'm more than just a little

[Chorus]
If I cry just a little and then laugh in the middle
And I hate you and I love you, and then I change my mind (A million times)
If I need just a little more time to deal with the fact
That you shoulda treated me right
Then I'm more than just a little justified
Mm, mm
I'm more than just a little justified
