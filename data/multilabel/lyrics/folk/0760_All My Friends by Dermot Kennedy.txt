A thief in the night came
Took everything you gave for her
This song isn't low, lady
It's remembering love made in the summer

[Verse 1]
But I think of the things that it taught me
I learned that there's beauty I can't keep
Learned that there's demons in stories
Letting her down, no, I won't be
Whenever she's calling, she'll call me
Angry and seething as the sea
Songs in cathedrals in month three
Promise you'll smile off a memory

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, I, I
I couldn't stop smiling like the whole way home
Yeah, it should feel like something you were missing

[Chorus]
To all my friends, you'll find your way
Some summer night, I hope I see you again
All my friends, I'd love to stay
Some summer night, I hope I see you again
You might also like[Verse 2]
Looking up lately
The moon doesn't chase me no more
Before it was childlike
Lost in the soft light, and so on

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, I, I
I couldn't stop smiling like the whole way home
And yeah, it should be when she read out all she'd written

[Chorus]
To all my friends, you'll find your way
Some summer night, I hope I see you again
All my friends, I'd love to stay
Some summer night, I hope I see you again

[Post-Chorus]
The smell of rain and streetlight thrown
A love, a lantern in the snow
But when she feels it taking hold
Finds it so hard letting go
How can I tell her that we'll shine?
She dreads the devil's yet to show
So damn reluctant to expose it to me, so
[Bridge]
So I think of the things that it taught me
She starts to think evil has lost me
I walked with the wolves and it haunts me
She steps with intention to run free
So stunner, don't ever move softly
You've been on a journey they can't see
When dancing in ballrooms, you will lead
Promise you'll smile off a memory

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, I, I
I couldn't stop smiling like the whole way home
And yeah, it should feel like something you were missing

[Chorus]
To all my friends, you'll find your way
Some summer night, I hope I see you again
All my friends, I'd love to stay
Some summer night, I hope I see you again

[Post-Chorus]
The smell of rain and streetlight thrown
A love, a lantern in the snow
But when she feels it taking hold
She finds it so hard letting go
How can I tell her that we'll shine?
She dreads the devil's yet to show
[Outro]
What I told you when
That I told you when
