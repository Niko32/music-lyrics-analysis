They questioned the king upon leavin'
Said open your eyes when you see
With her, all the singing came easy
All gold, cut the sun in the evening
But the birds have stopped singin' this season
Alright, alright, definite schemin'
I've never been good at this, really
I've started to see the birds need a reason to sing

[Verse 2]
I'll be making my way
Walk tall and don't go when you're lonely
Curse of us sinnin' and healin'
I do all of this hopin' she'll see me
I envy the sea, heavy, seethin'
The water and all of it breathin'
Sacred the secrets I'm keepin'
How we danced under circular ceilings
All the embraces we've been in

[Chorus]
Bring back one last time for the summers we saw
Second-guessin' and all
You were all on my mind, I'd love if you call
I'd love if you call
Now I couldn't tell, but she's keepin' me well
All of my secrets releasin' is pieces of me alone
Honestly destined to fail, but
You were all on my mind till we made what we are
Till we kissed in the car
Now I couldn't—
You might also like[Bridge]
All in, fall in, vulnerable as hell
Not stalling, crawl in, girl, you knew me well, mh
I like how the forest is leaning

[Chorus]
Bring back one last time for the summers we saw
Second-guessin' and all
You were all on my mind, I'd love if you call
I'd love if you call
Now I couldn't tell, but she's keepin' me well
All of my secrets releasin' is pieces of me alone
Honestly destined to fail, but
You were all on my mind till we made what we are
Till we kissed in the car
Now I couldn't—

[Chorus]
Bring back one last time for the summers we saw
Second-guessin' and all
You were all on my mind, I'd love if you call
I'd love if you call
Now I couldn't tell, but she's keepin' me well
All of my secrets releasin' is pieces of me alone
Honestly destined to fail, but
You were all on my mind till we made what we are
Till we kissed in the car
Now I couldn't—
