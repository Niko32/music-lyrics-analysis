Couldn't really love you anymore
You've become my ceiling
I don't think I love you anymore
That gold mine changed you
You don't have to hold me anymore
Our cave's collapsing
I don't wanna be me anymore
My old man told me

[Pre-Chorus]
"You don't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe that moment down."
Forty miles out of East Illinois
From my old man's heart attack

[Chorus]
I believed you were crazy
You believed that you loved me

[Verse 2]
I don't wanna bark here anymore
The black hills, the colly
Wasn't really dangerous for us
We'd just catch you coughing
What the hell are we gonna do?
A black mile to the surface
I don't wanna be here anymore
It all tastes like poison
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You can't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe that moment down
You can't open your eyes for a while
You just breathe

[Chorus]
I believed you were crazy
You believe that you love me
You and me, we're a day drink
So lose your faith in me
Lose your faith in me
Lose your faith in me
Hmm, ooh, oh
