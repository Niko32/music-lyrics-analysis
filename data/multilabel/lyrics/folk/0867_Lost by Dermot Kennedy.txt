When everything was broken
The devil hit his second stride
But you remember what I told you
Someday, I'll need your spine to hide behind
For fear of moments stolen
I don't wanna say goodnight
But I'll still see you in the morning
Still know your heart and still know both your eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
I could have told you ‘bout the long nights
How no one loves the birds that don't rise
So you can tell the heroes go hide
My sense of wonder's just a little tired

[Chorus]
But if only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine
I know you'd never leave me behind
But I am lost this time
Are we destined to burn or will we last the night?
I will hold you 'til I hold you right
But if only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine
You might also like[Verse 2]
So we'll run into the open
Keep your hand inside of mine
And then when everything is over
I hope to think of this as better times
The sky got red and swollen
I guess I never see the signs
There can't be songs for every soldier
It can't be solace every time you cry

[Pre-Chorus]
I could have told you ‘bout the long nights
How no one loves the birds that don't rise
So you can tell the heroes go hide
My sense of wonder's just a little tired

[Chorus]
But if only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine
I know you'd never leave me behind
But I am lost this time
Are we destined to burn or will we last the night?
I will hold you 'til I hold you right
But if only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine
[Bridge]
I was lost 'til I found you
Now these songs will hold and hide your name
All it was was all about you
Since that night, the moon has never seemed the same

[Chorus]
And if only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine
I know you'd never leave me behind
But I am lost this time
What if the love you deserve is love you never find?
I've learned in love and death, we don't decide
And if only you could see yourself in my eyes
You'd see you shine, you shine (Aye)
