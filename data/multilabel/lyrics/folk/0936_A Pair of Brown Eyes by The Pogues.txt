One summer evening, drunk to hell
I sat there nearly lifeless
An old man in the corner sang
"Where the Water Lilies Grow"
And on the jukebox, Johnny sang
About a thing called love
And it's "How are you, kid?' and "What's your name?"
And "How'd you bloody know?

[Verse 2]
In blood and death, 'neath a screaming sky
I laid down on the ground
And the arms and legs of other men
Were scattered all around
Some cursed, some prayed, some prayed, then cursed
Then prayed, then bled some more
And the only thing that I could see
Was a pair of brown eyes that was looking at me
But when we got back, labeled parts one to three
There was no pair of brown eyes waiting for me

[Chorus]
And a rovin', a rovin', a rovin' I'll go
For a pair of brown eyes
You might also like[Verse 3]
I looked at him, he looked at me
All I could do was hate him
While Ray and Philomena sang
Of my elusive dreams
I saw the streams, the rolling hills
Where his brown eyes were waiting
And I thought about a pair of brown eyes
That waited once for me

[Verse 4]
So drunk to hell, I left the place
Sometimes crawling, sometimes walking
A hungry sound came across the breeze
So I gave the walls a talking
And I heard the sounds of long ago
From the old canal
And the birds were whistling in the trees
Where the wind was gently laughing

[Chorus]
And a rovin', a rovin', a rovin' I'll go
A rovin', a rovin', a rovin' I'll go
And a rovin', a rovin', a rovin' I'll go
For a pair of brown eyes, for a pair of brown eyes
[Chorus]
And a rovin', a rovin', a rovin' I'll go
And a rovin', a rovin', a rovin' I'll go
And a rovin', a rovin', a rovin' I'll go
For a pair of brown eyes, for a pair of brown eyes
