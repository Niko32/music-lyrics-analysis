The birds they sang
At the break of day
Start again
I heard them say
Don't dwell on what
Has passed away
Or what is yet to be

[Verse 2]
Yeah, the wars
They will be fought again
The holy dove
She will be caught again
Bought and sold
And bought again
The dove is never free

[Chorus]
Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in

[Verse 3]
We asked for signs
The signs were sent
The birth betrayed
The marriage spent
Yeah, the widowhood
Of every government
Signs for all to see
You might also like[Verse 4]
I can't run no more
With that lawless crowd
While the killers in high places
Say their prayers out loud
But they've summoned
They've summoned up a thundercloud
They're gonna hear from me

[Chorus]
Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in

[Verse 5]
You can add up the parts
You won't have the sum
You can strike up the march
There is no drum
Every heart
Every heart to love will come
But like a refugee

[Chorus]
Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in
Ring the bells that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack, a crack in everything
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
That's how the light gets in
