My baby's a sailboat captain at sea
We don't give a damn we do as we please
My baby's a sailboat captain at sea
My gal is a good one, tells me she's mine
Wish I's better lookin'
Baby, don't mind
My gal is a good one, tells me she's mine

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted was to make you happy
Give you the truth
Anything to make you love me
Any more than you do

[Verse 2]
My baby's a sailboat captain at sea
We don't give a damn we do as we please
My baby's a sailboat captain at sea
My gal is a good one tells me she's mine
Wish I's better lookin'
Baby, don't mind
My gal is a good one tells me she's mine
My baby's a saint just like an Old George
Good with a dagger and skilled with a sword
All bullshit aside, she's all that and more
You might also like[Chorus]
All I ever wanted was to make you happy
Spit it all out
Anything to make me love you
Any less than I do now

[Post-Chorus]
But you're in my head
When we were in your bed
You said, you said "Yeah I'm so fucking sorry for this"

[Bridge]
Lord knows if she goes, she's gone
Say you don't mean that
Lord knows if she goes, she's gone
Say you don't mean that
La da da da
La da-da-da, la da da da-da da
La da-da-da, la da da da-da da
La da-da-da, la da da da-da da

[Chorus]
All I ever wanted was to make you happy
Give you the truth
Anything to make you love me
Any more than you do
[Outro]
My baby's a sailboat captain at sea
We don't give a damn we do as we please
My baby's a sailboat captain at sea
