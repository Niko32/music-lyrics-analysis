Hive mind is scary, I feel vulnerable and stupid
Waiting for a new embarrassment to go and tear right through me
A dependent, fruitless animal, watch me brimming with shame
And this confidence I fake only makes matters worse
I am not a stallion, I am just perverse
Hopeless, and docile, and tamed
Another day I won't remember, another day I wished away
Tedious days punctuated by dismay
Every day feels the same
Oh, it's the routine, and it's the regret
That makes me worse yet
Oh, did I forget your name or make a joke and no one laughed?
Did I come across as stupid or did I cum too fast?
This isn't a brave face, this isn't a brave face
This is a mask

It doesn't take much to make me feel small
