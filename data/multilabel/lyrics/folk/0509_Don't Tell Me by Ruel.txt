Save your breath, my brother, it's not going in
I'm not your disciple, I choose how I sin
I've got a distant memory of previous lives
So don't say I'm not ready, back off with those knives

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know me like you used to
You can leave, but I refuse to
You can tell me that I'm crazy
But I won't stop and this won't make me

[Chorus]
Ooh-hoo, hoo
Oh-oh oh, don't tell me I'm not ready
Ooh-hoo, hoo
Oh-oh oh, don't tell me I'm not ready
For love, for love

[Verse 2]
I don't feel connected to all of your lies
But you can do a kindness and look me in the eyes
My soul's resurrected, yeah, it's been here before
So don't say I'm not ready 'til I fall on my sword

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know me like you used to
Yeah, you can leave, but I refuse to
You can tell me that I'm crazy
But I won't stop and this won't make me
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, ooh-hoo, hoo
Oh-oh oh, don't tell me I'm not ready
Ooh-hoo, hoo
Oh-oh oh, don't tell me I'm not ready for love

[Bridge]
The course that you have set for me, the shadows you cast over me
The road is getting hard to see, but I'm gonna make it through
Horizons that are outta sight, lost behind the fading light
I'm ready for what's coming, and they best be ready too

[Chorus]
Ooh-hoo, hoo
Oh-oh oh, don't tell me I'm not ready for love
Ooh-hoo, hoo (for love, for love)
Oh-oh oh, don't tell me I'm not ready for love
Ooh-hoo, hoo
Oh-oh oh, don't tell me I'm not ready
Ooh-hoo, hoo
Oh-oh oh, don't tell me I'm not ready for love
