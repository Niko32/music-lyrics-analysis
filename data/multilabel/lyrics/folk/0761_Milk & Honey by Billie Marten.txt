Honey, here we are
Dreaming in the dark
Trouble seemed so far
Share thoughts for hours
But now we dream apart
Now we dream apart
Oil and water

[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm just content with time well spent
Savor the taste of sugar

[Chorus]
But all you want is milk
More than you can drink
All you want is honey
You can't take the sting
You live for overkill
But you're ungrateful still
All you want is honey
Well honey I tried
You just want more
And now it's all gone

[Verse 2]
Honey, you're so kind
Oh, you're full of light
You show me your best side
You pick up every rose in sight
But all the roses die
I'd rather keep them alive
Roots grow slowly
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But I'd be content with time well spent
Savor the taste of sugar

[Chorus]
But all you want is milk
More than you can drink
All you want is honey
You can't take the sting
You live for overkill
But you're ungrateful still
All you want is honey
Well honey I tried
You just want more
You just want more

[Bridge]
Honey, I tried
To make it work
You're unsatisfied
You make it worse
Honey, I died

[Chorus]
Still all you want is milk
More than you can drink
All you want is honey
You can't take the sting
You live for overkill
But you're ungrateful still
All you want is honey
Well honey I tried
You just want more
You just want more
You just want more
And now it's all gone
