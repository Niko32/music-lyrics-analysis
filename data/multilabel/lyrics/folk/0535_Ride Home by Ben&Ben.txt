Took a morning ride to the place where you and I were supposed to meet
The city yawns, they echo on
My thoughts are spinning on and on my head it seems
They lead me back to you I keep coming back to you

[Verse 2]
Took a morning ride, found a place up in my mind, no one else can see
Maybe it's fate that we lose control, in circles around we go
We become who we ought to know
We just gotta let it go, we just gotta let it go

[Chorus]
So I'm coming home to you, you
You're all I need, the very air I breathe
You are home, home

[Verse 3]
Took a morning ride, gotta leave this all behind, for with you is where I want to be
Maybe it's fate that we can't control, oh round and around it goes
And all that we seem to know
We just gotta let it go, we just gotta let it go

[Chorus]
So I'm coming home to you, you
You're all I need, the very air I breathe
You are home
You might also like[Bridge]
So many questions, I've thrown to the skies
All of the answers, I've found in your eyes
When I'm with you home is never too far
My weary heart has come to rest in yours
I found my way home

[Chorus]
So I'm coming home to you, you
You're all I need, the very air I breathe
You are home

[Chorus]
Coming home to you, you
You're all I need, the very air I breathe
You are home
