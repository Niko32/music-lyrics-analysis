Haven't laughed this hard in a long time
I better stop now before I start crying
Go off to sleep in the sunshine
I don't want to see the day when it's dying

[Chorus]
She's a sight to see (Sight to see)
She's a-good to me (Good to me)
But I'm already somebody's baby
She's a pretty thing (Pretty thing)
And she knows everything (Everything)
But I'm already somebody's baby

[Verse 2]
You don't deserve to be lonely
But those drugs you got won't make you feel better
Pretty soon you'll find it's the only
Little part of your life you're keeping together

[Chorus]
I'm a-nice to you (Nice to you)
I could make it through (Make it through)
That you're already somebody's baby
I could make you smile (Make you smile)
If you stayed a while (Stayed a while)
But how long will you stay with me baby?

[Verse 3]
Because your candle burns too bright
Well, I almost forgot it was twilight
Even if I think that you are right
Well, I'm tired of being down, I got no fight

[Chorus]
You're wonderful (Wonderful)
When it's beautiful (Beautiful)
But I'm already somebody's baby
And if I went with you (Went with you)
I'd disappoint you too (Disappoint you too)
Well, I'm already somebody's baby
Already somebody's baby
