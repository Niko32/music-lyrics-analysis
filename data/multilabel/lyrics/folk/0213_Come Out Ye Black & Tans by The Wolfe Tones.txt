I was born on a Dublin street where the loyal drums did beat
And those loving English feet, they walked all over us
And every single night when me da' would come home tight
He'd invite the neighbours out with this chorus

[Chorus]
Come out ye black and tans
Come out and fight me like a man
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders
Tell her how the IRA
Made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra

[Verse 2]
Come let us hear you tell
How you slandered great Parnell
When you thought him well and truly persecuted
Where are the sneers and jeers
That you loudly let us hear?
When our leaders of sixteen were executed

[Chorus]
Come out ye black and tans
Come out and fight me like a man
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders
Tell her how the IRA
Made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra
You might also like[Verse 3]
Come tell us how you slew
Them ol' Arabs two by two
Like the Zulus they had spears and bows and arrows
How bravely you faced one
With your sixteen pounder gun
And you frightened them damn natives to their marrow

[Chorus]
Come out ye black and tans
Come out and fight me like a man
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders
Tell her how the IRA made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra

[Verse 4]
Now the time is coming fast
And I think them days are here
When each English seánín, he'll run before us
And if there'll be a need
Then our kids will say "Godspeed"
With a verse or two of singing this fine chorus

[Chorus]
Come out ye black and tans
Come out and fight me like a man
Show your wife how you won medals down in Flanders
Tell her how the IRA
Made you run like hell away
From the green and lovely lanes of Killashandra
