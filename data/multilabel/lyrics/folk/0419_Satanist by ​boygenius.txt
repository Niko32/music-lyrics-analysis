Will you be a Satanist with me?
Mortgage off your soul to buy your dream
Vacation home in Florida
The collateral the Devil's repossessin' from me
Tryin' to score some off-brand ecstasy

[Verse 2: Bridgers, All]
Will you be an anarchist with me?
Sleep in cars and kill the bourgeoisie
At least until you find out what a fake I am
Spray paint my initials on an ATM
I burn my cash and smash my old TV

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3: Dacus, All, Bridgers]
Will you be a nihilist with me?
If nothin' matters, man, that's a relief
Solomon had a point when he wrote "Ecclesiastes"
If nothing can be known, then stupidity is holy
If the void becomes a bore, we'll treat ourselves to some self-belief
(Oh, you know what I should do?)

[Instrumental Break]
You might also like[Outro: All]
You wonder
If you can even be seen
From so far away
A slow pull
A seismic drift
Leaning over the edge of the continent
It's so hard to come back
You hang on
Until it drags
You under, you under
You under, you under
