I thought I had something
And that's the same as having something
I get mad at nothing, blame my dad for something
I pull no punches, then feel bad for months
Mm, thought I was raised better, tried to fake better
Tried to blame weather and escape better
Hope the skin heals where the pain enters

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, but I finally got sewed up
I set a time, then I showed up
And, now, the weight of the world ain't so bad
Mm-mhm

[Chorus]
I saw the еnd, it looks just like the middle
I got a papеr and pen and a page with no space
I filled the hole in my head with prescription medication
And forgot how to cry
Who am I to complain?

[Verse 2]
And now the pain's different
It still exists, it just escapes different
And evades vision, makes the rain different
Makes the news boring, and my rage distant
Yes, I'm young and living dreams
In love with being noticed
And afraid of being seen
But I can finally eat
And I can fall asleep
It's fine, fine, fine
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I finally got sewed up
I set a time, then I showed up
And, now, the weight of the world ain't that bad

[Chorus]
Well, I saw the end, it looks just like the middle
I got a paper and pen and a page with no space
I filled the hole in my head with prescription medication
Then forgot how to cry, who am I, who am I to complain?

[Post-Chorus]
To complain
Oh, oh-oh, oh
To complain

[Outro]
I saw the end, it looked just like the middle
I got a paper and pen, but I can't feel the pain
I filled the hole in my head with prescription medication
Then forgot how to cry
Who am I to complain?
