Don't you know that I'll be around to guide you
Through your weakest moments to leave them behind you?
Returning nightmares, only shadows

[Chorus]
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright, for now

[Verse 2]
Crosses all over, heavy on your shoulders
The sirens inside you waiting to step forward
Disturbing silence darkens your sight

[Chorus]
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright, for now

[Bridge]
Crosses all over the boulevard
Crosses all over the boulevard
Crosses all over the boulevard
Crosses all over the boulevard
Crosses all over the boulevard

[Verse 3]
The streets outside your window, over-flooded
People staring, they know you've been broken
Repeatedly reminded by the looks on their faces
You might also like[Chorus]
Ignore them tonight and you'll be alright
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright
