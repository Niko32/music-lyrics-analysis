I love everybody because I love you
When you stood up, walked away barefoot
And the grass where you lay left a bed in your shape
I looked over it and I ached

[Verse 2]
I love everybody because I love you
I don't need the city and I don't need proof
All I need, darling, is a life in your shape
I picture it soft and I ache

[Pre-Chorus]
Look at you, strawberry blond

[Verse 3]
Reach out the car window, trying to hold the wind
You tell me you love her, I give you a grin
Oh, all I ever wanted was a life in your shape
So, I follow the white lines, follow the white lines

[Pre-Chorus]
Keep my eyes on the road as I ache

[Chorus]
Look at you, strawberry blond, fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm? Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way
Look at you, strawberry blond, fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm? Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Look at you, strawberry blond, fields rolling on
I love it when you call my name
Can you hear the bumblebees swarm? Watching your arm
I love it when you look my way

[Outro]
Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah
Isaiah, Isaiah, Isaiah
