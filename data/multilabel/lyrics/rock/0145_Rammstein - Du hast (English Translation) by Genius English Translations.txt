You, you have, you have me
You, you have, you have me
You, you have, you have me
You, you have, you have me

[Pre-Chorus]
You, you have, you have me
You have me, you asked me
You asked me, you asked me and I said nothing

[Chorus]
Do you want, until death separates you
To be faithful to her for all days?
(Yes) No
(Yes) No
Do you want, until death, which would separate
To love her, even in bad days?
(Yes) No
(Yes) No

[Verse]
You, you have, you have me
You, you have, you have me

[Pre-Chorus]
You, you have, you have me
You have me, you asked me
You asked me, you asked me and I said nothing
