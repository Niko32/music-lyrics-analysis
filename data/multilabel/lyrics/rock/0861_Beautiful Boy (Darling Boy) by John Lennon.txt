[Verse 1]
Close your eyes
Have no fear
The monster's gone, he's on the run
And your daddy's here

[Chorus]
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy

[Verse 2]
Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day in every way
It's getting better and better

[Chorus]
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy

Out on the ocean sailing away
I can hardly wait to see you come of age
But I guess we'll both just have to be patient
'Cause it's a long way to go
A hard row to hoe
Yes, it's a long way to go
But in the meantime

[Verse 3]
Before you cross the street
Take my hand
Life is what happens to you
While you're busy making other plans

[Chorus]
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy

[Verse 4]
Before you go to sleep
Say a little prayer
Every day in every way
It's getting better and better
[Chorus]
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful boy

[Outro]
Darlin', darlin', darlin'
Darlin' Sean
Goodnight, Sean
See you in the morning
Bright and early
