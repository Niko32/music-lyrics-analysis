Is it still me that makes you sweat?
Am I who you think about in bed
When the lights are dim and your hands are shaking
As you're sliding off your dress?
Then think of what you did
And how I hope to God he was worth it
When the lights are dim and your heart is racing
As your fingers touch his skin

[Verse 2]
I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet, sweetie, you had me
Girl, I was it, look past the sweat, a better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat?
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster!

[Chorus]
So, testosterone boys and harlequin girls:
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So, testosterone boys and harlequin girls:
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

So, I guess we're back to us
Oh, cameraman, swing the focus!
In case I lost my train of thought
Where was it that we last left off?
(Let's pick up, pick up)
[Verse 3]
Oh, now I do recall
We were just getting to the part...
Where the shock sets in
And the stomach acid finds a new way to make you get sick
I hope you didn't expect to get all of the attention
Now, let's not get selfish
Did you really think I'd let you kill this chorus?

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster!

[Chorus]
So, testosterone boys and harlequin girls:
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?
So, testosterone boys and harlequin girls:
Will you dance to this beat and hold a lover close?

[Post-Chorus]
Dance to this beat, dance to this beat
Dance to this beat
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster and faster!
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster!
[Verse 4]
I've got more wit, a better kiss, a hotter touch, a better fuck
Than any boy you'll ever meet, sweetie, you had me
Girl, I was it, look past the sweat, a better love deserving of
Exchanging body heat in the passenger seat?
No, no, no, you know it will always just be me

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's get these teen hearts beating faster, faster!

Dance to this beat
And hold a lover close
