Dare me to jump off of this Jersey bridge
I bet you never had a Friday night like this
Keep it up, keep it up, let's raise our hands
I take a look up at the sky, and I see red
Red for the cancer, red for the wealthy
Red for the drink that's mixed with suicide
Everything red
[Pre-Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
Please won't you push me for the last time?
Let's scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want this anymore
The thought of you's no fuckin' fun
You want a martyr? I'll be one
Because enough's enough, we're done

[Chorus: Vic Fuentes]
You told me, "Think about it," well, I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of beggin' for the things that I want
I'm over sleepin' like a dog on the floor

[Post-Chorus: Vic Fuentes]
Yeah!

The thing I think I love will surely bring me pain
Intoxication, paranoia, and a lot of fame
Three cheers for throwing up, pubescent drama queen
You make me sick, I make it worse by drinkin' late

[Pre-Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
Scream, scream, scream, scream
Scream, scream until there's nothing left
So sick of playing, I don't want to anymore
The thought of you's no fuckin' fun
You want a martyr? I'll be one
Because enough's enough, we're done

[Chorus: Vic Fuentes & Kellin Quinn]
You told me, "Think about it," well, I did (Well, I did)
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of beggin' for the things that I want
I'm over sleepin' like a dog on the floor
Imagine livin' like a king someday
A single night without a ghost in the wallsAnd if the bass shakes the earth underground
We'll start a new revolution now
Now!

[Post-Chorus: Kellin Quinn]
Alright, here we go
[Bridge: Vic Fuentes]
Hail Mary, forgive me
Blood for blood, hearts beating
Come at me, now this is war
Fuck with this new beat, oh

[Breakdown: Vic Fuentes & Kellin Quinn]
Now terror begins inside a bloodless vein
I was just a product of the street youth rage
Born in this world without a voice or say
Caught in the spokes with an abandoned brain
I know you well, but this ain't a game
Blow the smoke in diamond shape
Dying is a gift, so close your eyes and rest in peace

[Chorus: Vic Fuentes & Kellin Quinn]
You told me, "Think about it," well, I did
Now I don't wanna feel a thing anymore
I'm tired of beggin' for the things that I want
I'm over sleepin' like a dog on the floor
Imagine livin' like a king someday
A single night without a ghost in the walls
We are the shadows screamin', "Take us now!"
We'd rather die than live to rust on the ground

[Outro: Vic Fuentes]
Shit
