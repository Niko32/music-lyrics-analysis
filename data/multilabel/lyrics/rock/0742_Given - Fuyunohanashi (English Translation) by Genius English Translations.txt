Just like the shade of snow
That hasn't completely melted
I carry on with these feelings inside me
Hey, with what words
Should I close the door of this love?

[Chorus]
Your everything has lost its eternal tomorrow
And now it's wandering around eternally
Along with me
Who was unable to say goodbye or move on from you

[Verse 2]
Just like a spell that's still unbroken
Or maybe it's some kind of curse
I'm still holding on to my thoughts
Hey, what kind of tomorrow
Should I look for in this town?
Ah-ah

[Bridge]
The cold tears that fall
Freeze under the sky
They're just pretending to be kind
As they fall down my face
Two people who were always together are now torn apart
That's all there is to this story
You might also like[Chorus]
Even if your everything loses its shape one day
You'll always be here with me
As I try to move on again
Even though I couldn't say goodbye to you
I’ll carry on because I know
You’ll always be with me
