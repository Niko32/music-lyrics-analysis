[Verse 1: Brandon Lake]

I'll praise when I'm sure, praise when I'm doubting
I'll praise when outnumbered, praise when surrounded
'Cause praise is the waters my enemies drown in

Praise the Lord, oh my soul (C'mon)
Praise the Lord, oh my soul

[Verse 2: Chris Brown & Chandler Moore]
I'll praise when I feel it, and I'll praise when I don’t (Yeah)
I'll praise 'cause I know You’re still in control
'Cause my praise is a weapon, it's more than a sound (More than a sound)
Oh, my praise is the shout that brings Jericho down (Yeah)
