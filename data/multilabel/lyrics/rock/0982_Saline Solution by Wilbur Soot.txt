One, two, three and four

[Verse 1]
I think this time I'm dying
I’m not melodramatic
I'm just pragmatic beyond any
Reasoning for thinking I've got
Fuckin’ rabies, or something

[Refrain]
I think this time I'm dying
I think this time I'm dying

[Verse 2]
I think I've lost my mind
Blurring the fact and the fictions
Whilst simultaneously fixing
Myself up with a girl
Named Panadol
Bite the tablet, elixir
Disintegrate, mouth's a mixer

[Refrain]
I think I've lost my mind
I think I've lost my mind
You might also like[Bridge]
If I could just break one more night
Maybe I could wake up and feel alright
My optimistically set alarm clock time
Serves only to mock me with flashing lights

[Verse 3]
I think I've made my choice
I’m a deceased playing victim
Slip the fate, slip the victory
I think I’ve made my choice
Sink secluded in hatred
Void the plans friends are making
I think I've found my voice
I’m a leech sucking blood bags
Taste defeat, it's a sandbag

[Outro]
Saline solution
Saline solution to all your
Saline solution to all your
Saline solution to all your problems
