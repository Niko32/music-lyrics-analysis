Lay where you're layin'
Don't make a sound
I know they're watchin'
They're watchin'
All the commotion
The kiddie-like play
It has people talkin'
Talkin'

[Chorus]
You
Your sex is on fire

[Verse 2]
The dark of the alley
The breakin' of day
Head while I'm drivin'
I'm drivin'
Soft lips are open
Them knuckles are pale
Feels like you're dyin'
You're dyin'

[Chorus]
You
Your sex is on fire
Consumed
With what's to transpire
You might also like[Verse 3]
Hot as a fever
Rattlin' bones
I could just taste it
Taste it
If it's not forever
If it's just tonight
Oh, we're still the greatest
The greatest, the greatest

[Chorus]
You
Your sex is on fire
You
Your sex is on fire, ah
Consumed
With what's to transpire
And you
Your sex is on fire
Consume
With what's to transpire
