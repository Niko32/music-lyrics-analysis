The things I'm about to, tell you aren't so you
Change what's already on your mind
It's just that I keep thinking about all the melodies
You made asleep at night

[Pre-Chorus: Young K]
Every time I got out of bed to (Oh, no)
Start my day that's when I would hear you (Oh-oh-oh)
And with a tired yawn, you'd tell me that you loved me, I'll be fine
And that's what got me through the day alright

[Chorus: Wonpil, Sungjin]
Beautiful
Just the way that you would look at me
Was so much I'd never wanna leave
I, I keep tryna forget how you were
Beautiful
Just the way that you were calling my name
But without you it won't be the same
I, I keep tryna forget but you were beautiful

[Verse 2: Wonpil]
No matter what I do, I know that to you
Things will just stay the way they are
Just that I keep thinking about how we used to be
God, I just hate this part
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Young K]
Every time I would get upset you'd (Oh, no)
You'd hold me tight and wouldn't let go (Oh-oh-oh)
And with your head on mine, you'd make me realize I would be just fine
That you'd stay here until it was alright

[Chorus: Jae, Sungjin]
Beautiful
Just the way that you would look at me
Was so much Iâ€™d never wanna leave
I, I keep tryna forget how you were
Beautiful
Just the way that you were calling my name
But without you it won't be the same
I, I keep tryna forget but you were beautiful

[Bridge: Jae, Young K]
Think I've cried more than I had imagined
If this is real take me back to the start then
What I want but I know it can't happen
Baby, I know, it's already over
I don't want you to hurt but can't help it
Every moment is thoughts of you back when
I saw you throw me a smile and that had me

[Chorus: Wonpil, Sungjin]
Beautiful
'Cause the last time that you looked at me
I did all I could, I watched you leave
I, I keep tryna forget how you were
Beautiful
All the things you gave to stay with me
All your smiles when I would disagree
I, I keep tryna forget but you were beautiful
