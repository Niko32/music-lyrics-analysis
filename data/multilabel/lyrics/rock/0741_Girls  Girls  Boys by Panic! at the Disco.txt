I don't wanna hear you've got a boyfriend
Sometimes, you're better off alone
But if you change your mind, you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind, you know where to find me
'Cause I don't ever wanna be your boyfriend

[Pre-Chorus]
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

[Chorus]
Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys
And love is not a choice

[Verse 2]
Pose, you've gotta save your reputation
They're close to finding out about your girlfriend
But if you change your mind, you know where I am
Yeah, if you change your mind, you know where to find me
'Cause I don't wanna save your reputation
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
Push another girl aside and just give in

[Chorus]
Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys
And love is not a choice

[Bridge]
I am just a villain vying for attention from a girl
A girl who can't decide and here's the reason why

[Chorus]
Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
Girls love girls and boys (Sophisticated, manipulated)
And never did I think that I
Would be caught in the way you got me
But girls love girls and boys
And love is not a choice
