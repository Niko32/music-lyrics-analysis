Running 'round the whole city for someone
To look me in my eyes and tell me pretty lies
Teardrops keep blurring up my sight
And right now I'm driving in my car
Going so fast, baby, so fast, baby
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Don't leave me in the dark
You said you won't be far
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't stand the quiet
Is anyone out there?
Is anyone out there?

[Chorus]
I'm on my worst behavior
Don't stop me now
I f**king hate this world
So show me a way out
Wake me up from this nightmare, please
I can't stand this reality
I'm on my worst behavior
How you like me now?
Put a muzzle on me
I'll spit in your mouth
Wake me up from this nightmarе, please
I'm scarred and bruisеd with a black eyed face
You might also like[Verse 2]
Woke up on the highway
I didn't go home last night
What you know 'bout me?
I ain't got nothing
So why you keep coming to me?
With your innocent eyes, you smile so bright
Stop wasting your sunshine on me
'Cause I can't tell if it's real or a lie
Solitude
I got a couple friends
Just me, myself, and I
We play with fireworks all night
I'm okay
I'll just let it burn everything around me
'Cause you can't save me from my sadness
No, don't save me

[Chorus]
I'm on my worst behavior
Don't stop me now
I f**king hate this world
So show me a way out
Wake me up from this nightmare, please
I can't stand this reality
I'm on my worst behavior
How you like me now?
Put a muzzle on me
I'll spit in your mouth
Wake me up from this nightmare, please
I'm scarred and bruised with a black eyed face
[Outro]
Turn on the radio all the way up
'Til your eardrums explode
Let's dance all night long
But if you come too close
I might just burn you whole
Turn my back and shut the door
Knock, knock
Is there anybody out there?
