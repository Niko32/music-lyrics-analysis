One, two

[Verse 1]
It's been a couple months
That's just about enough time
For me to stop crying when I look at all the pictures
Now I kinda smile, I haven't felt that in a while
It's late, I hear the doorbell ringin' and it's pourin'
I open up that door, see your brown eyes at the entrance
You just wanna talk, and I can't turn away a wet dog

[Pre-Chorus]
But, please, don't ruin this for me
Please, don't make it harder than it already is
I'm trying to get over this

[Chorus]
I wish that you would stay in my memories
But you show up today, just to ruin things
I wanna put you in the past 'cause I'm traumatized
But you're not lettin' me do that, 'cause tonight
You're all drunk in my kitchen, curled in the fetal position
Too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when I say
"I wish that you would stay in my memories"
In my memories, stay in my memories
You might also like[Verse 2]
Now I can't say "Goodbye" if you stay here the whole night
You see, it's hard to find an end to somethin'
That you keep beginning over and over again
I promise that the ending always stays the same

[Pre-Chorus]
So, there's no good reason in make believin'
That we could ever exist again
I can't be your friend, can't be your lover
Can't be the reason we hold back each other from falling in love
With somebody other than me

[Chorus]
I wish that you would stay in my memories
But you show up today, just to ruin things
I wanna put you in the past 'cause I'm traumatized
But you're not lettin' me do that, 'cause tonight
You're all drunk in my kitchen, curled in the fetal position
Too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when I say
"I wish that you would stay in my memories"
In my memories, stay in my memories

[Bridge]
Since you came
I guess I'll let you stay
For as long as it takes
To grab your books and your coat
And that one good cologne
That you bought when we were fighting
'Cause it's still on my clothes, everything that I own
And it makes me feel like dying
I was barely just surviving
[Chorus]
I wish that you would stay in my memories
But you show up today, just to ruin things
I wanna put you in the past 'cause I'm traumatized
But you're not lettin' me do that, 'cause tonight
You're all drunk in my kitchen, curled in the fetal position
Too busy playing the victim to be listening to me when I say
"I wish that you would stay in my memories"
In my memories, stay in my memories
