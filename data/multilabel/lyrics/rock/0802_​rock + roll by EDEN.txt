So tell me this is who you are, yeah
They tell me I've got something more
And oh, you could be loved
But I don't want the lights to find me
When I'm dark and lost, but never on my own

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna swing like Sinatra
Singing like I can't stop
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I just wanna live like the ones before, yeah
And maybe I could play guitar like Hendrix or save the world or end it, and
Then maybe they'll remember me when I'm gone
That's all I could ever want
That's all I want

[Verse 2]
So I got ten minutes to be all or nothing to whoever wants to hear
And I got ten weeks of talking bullshit on repeat till I'm burnt out and disappear
But I owe you nothing
And I own my luck
Oh, they said, "You'll never be alone again"
But I don't think you understand me or what I fear
"But you could be loved"
But I don't wanna lie to tell myself
I'm more than all the mistakes I've outrun
'Cause I'm only here for a minute
You might also like[Bridge]
And I don't care what you say 'cause I know
You're only here 'cause I'm winning
But I can be my own kind of rock and roll, I
I don't really care if you say you don't fuck with me
And I can say what the fuck I want 'cause it's down to me
And I got love for you even if you are doubting me
Like, oh my God, I just can't stop

[Chorus]
'Cause I just wanna sing like Sinatra with ethanol my soundtrack
'Cause I could never rock like a Rolling Stone
I wonder how it feels to burn out young, yeah
'Cause I just wanna die before my heart fails from heartbreak or cocktails, and
Then maybe you'll cry once you know I'm gone
That's all I could ever want, oh, that's all I want, yeah

[Outro: EDEN, Speaker 1, Speaker 2]
'Cause I ain't scared of livin'
Does it get easier?
No
No, I ain't scared of livin'
Yes, it gets easier
Oh yeah?
No, I ain't scared of livin'
Look at you
(Sex, drugs, and rock and roll, that's all I want)
'Cause it's all we've got, what are we breathin' for if we ain't living?
I ain't scared of livin'
(What's under the words you know, that's all I want)
And I don't want your love, I just wanna feel like I'm still livin'
I ain't scared of livin'
(Something more than superficial is all I want)
And if there is no god, I know the day I die, I lived through heaven
(Sex, drugs, and rock and roll, that's all I want)
And that I gave it hell
And if it hurt, oh well, at least, that's living
I ain't scared of livin'
The more you know who you are and what you want...
That's all I want
...the less you let things upset you
That's all I want
I just don't know what I'm supposed to be, you know?
I tried being a writer, but
I hate what I write
And I tried taking pictures, but they were so mediocre
You know, and every girl goes through a photography phase
You know, like horses
You know, take...uh...dumb pictures of your feet
You'll figure that out, I'm not worried about you
[Extended]
If all we had is time, then we'll be alright
It's not much, but it's better than nothing
Sex, drugs and rock and roll, that's all I want
What's under the words, you know that's all I want
Something more than superficial is all I want
Sex, drugs and rock and roll, that's all I want
