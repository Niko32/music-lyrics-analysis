Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I used to rule the world
Chunks would load when I gave the word
Now every night I go stow away
Hide from the mobs I used to slay

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Verse 2]
They once were terrified
Every time I looked into their eyes
Villagers would cheer my way
For a hero I was, that's what they'd say
One minute we had it all
Next, our world began to fall
Away from all that it had once become
They all cried for my help, but I stood there numb

[Chorus]
I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Note block choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn around, pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
And hope one day that this chaos and
Destruction turns for the better
Never a bow in hand
That was when I ruled the land

[Verse 3]
It was the creepers and the skeletons
Blew down the doors and boxed us in
Arrows whizzing by like streaks of light
I tried all that I could to stay and fight
As the undead roamed the street
Families broken at my feet
Life itself suspended by a thread
Oh, why was it that I wasn't dead?

[Chorus]
I gaze off into the boundless skyline
Note block choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn around, pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
That was when I ruled the land

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
[Chorus]
I gazed off into the boundless skyline
Note block choirs playing in the sunshine
Turn around, pick up my sword and wield
The blade that once forced evil mobs to yield
If this battle should leave me slain
I know Herobrine will call my name
Better to take a stand
And that was when I ruled the land

[Outro]
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
