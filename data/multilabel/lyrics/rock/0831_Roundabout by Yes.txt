[Refrain]
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out-and-out
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and in and out the valley

[Verse 1]
The music dance and sing
They make the children really ring
I spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and in and out the valley

[Chorus]
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over, we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers, we'll be there and laughing, too
Twenty-four before my love, you'll see I'll be there with you

[Verse 2]
I will remember you
Your silhouette will charge the view
Of distant atmosphere
Call it morning driving through the sound and even in the valley
You might also like[Chorus]
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over, we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers, we'll be there and laughing, too
Twenty-four before my love, you'll see I'll be there with you
[Middle-Eight]
Along the drifting cloud, the eagle searching down on the land
Catching the swirling wind, the sailor sees the rim of the land
The eagle's dancing wings create as weather spins out of hand
Go closer, hold the land feel partly no more than grains of sand
We stand to lose all time, a thousand answers by in our hand
Next to your deeper fears, we stand surrounded by a million years
I'll be the roundabout, the words will make you out-and-out
I'll be the roundabout, the words will make you out-and-out

[Bridge]
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky, they stand there
Twenty-four before my love and I'll be there

[Refrain]
I'll be the roundabout
The words will make you out-and-out
You spend the day your way
Call it morning driving through the sound and in and out the valley

[Chorus]
In and around the lake
Mountains come out of the sky and they stand there
One mile over, we'll be there and we'll see you
Ten true summers, we'll be there and laughing, too
Twenty-four before my love, you'll see I'll be there with you
