When I get home
You better not be there
We're placin' bets you won't

[Pre-Chorus]
Shed your modesty
And the only thing to leave behind
Is your own skin on the floor

[Chorus]
Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
Manifest a ceiling
When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
Searchin' for that feelin'
Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)

Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
Manifest a ceiling
When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
Searchin' for that feelin'
Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)
That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)
Like a song he wrote (Ah-ah-ah)
That's never heard

[Verse 3]
When I get home
Boy, you better not be there
You're long gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Shed your modesty
Don't circle the track
Just break the cycle in half
And leave your skin on the floor

[Chorus]
Don't you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
Manifest a ceiling
When you shy away (Ah-ah-ah)
Searchin' for that feelin'
Just like an "I love you" (Ooh, ooh)
That isn't words (Ooh, ooh)
Like a song he wrote (Ah-ah-ah)
That's never heard
That's never heard (Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah)
[Outro]
An "I love you"
That isn't words
Like a song he wrote
That's never heard
Don't you shy away
