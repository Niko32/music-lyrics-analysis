I don't know why I just feel I'm better off
Stayin' in the same room I was born in
I look outside and see a whole world better off
Without me in it tryin' to transform it

[Chorus]
You are out of my mind, oh
You aren't seein' my side, oh
You waste all this time tryin' to get to me
But you are out of my mind, yeah

[Verse 2]
Listen, I know
This one's a contradiction because of how happy it sounds
But the lyrics are so down
It's okay though
Because it represents, wait, better yet it is
Who I feel I am right now

[Chorus]
You are out of my mind, oh
You aren't seein' my side, oh
You waste all this time tryin' to get to me
But you are out of my mind
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Heard you say, "Not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, "there's no choice"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise

[Bridge]
Oh, don't you test me, no
Just because I play the piano
Doesn't mean I, I'm not willin' to take you down
I'm sorry

[Chorus]
I'm, I'm out of my mind, oh
I'm not seein' things right, oh
I waste all this time tryin' to run from you
But I'm, I'm out of my mind

[Post-Chorus]
Heard you say, "Not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, "there's no choice"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise

[Bridge 2]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, oh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
[Chorus]
You are out of my mind
You aren't seein' my side
You waste all this time tryin' to get to me
But you are out of my mind

[Post-Chorus]
Heard you say, "Not today"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a sound
Heard your voice, "there's no choice"
Tore the curtains down, windows open, now make a noise

[Outro]
