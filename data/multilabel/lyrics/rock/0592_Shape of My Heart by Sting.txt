He deals the cards as a meditation
And those he plays never suspect
He doesn't play for the money he wins
He don't play for respect

[Verse 2]
He deals the cards to find the answer
The sacred geometry of chance
The hidden law of a probable outcome
The numbers lead a dance

[Chorus]
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

[Verse 3]
He may play the jack of diamonds
He may lay the queen of spades
He may conceal a king in his hand
While a memory of it fades

[Chorus]
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart
You might also like[Bridge]
That's not the shape, shape of my heart
[​​Harmonica Solo]​​

[Verse 4]
And if I told you that I loved you
You'd maybe think there's something wrong
I'm not a man of too many faces
The mask I wear is one

[Verse 5]
But those who speak know nothing
And find out to their cost
Like those who curse their luck in too many places
And those who fear are lost

[Chorus]
I know that the spades are the swords of a soldier
I know that the clubs are weapons of war
I know that diamonds mean money for this art
But that's not the shape of my heart

[Outro]
That's not the shape of my heart
That's not the shape, the shape of my heart
