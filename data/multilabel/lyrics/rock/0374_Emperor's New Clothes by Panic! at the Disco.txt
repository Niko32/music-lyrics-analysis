[Intro]
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)
Finders keepers, losers weepers
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)

[Verse 1]
Welcome to the end of eras, ice has melted back to life
Done my time and served my sentence
Dress me up and watch me die
If it feels good, tastes good, it must be mine
Dynasty decapitated, you just might see a ghost tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)
And if you don't know, now you know

[Chorus]
I'm taking back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh yeah
The crown, so close, I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh yeah
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)

Sycophants on velvet sofas, lavish mansions, vintage wine
I am so much more than royal
Snatch your chain and mace your eyes
If it feels good, tastes good, it must be mine
Heroes always get remembered, but you know legends never die

[Pre-Chorus]
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)
And if you don't know, now you know

[Chorus]
I'm taking back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh, yeah
The crown, so close, I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh, yeah

[Bridge]
Mortal kings are ruling castles
Welcome to my world of fun
Liars settle into sockets
Flip the switch and watch them run
Oh, yeah, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
(Finders keepers, losers weepers)
[Chorus]
I'm taking back, back, taking back, back the crown
I'm all dressed up and naked
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh, yeah
The crown, so close, I can taste it
I see what's mine and take it
(Finders keepers, losers weepers), oh, yeah

[Outro]
Finders keepers, losers weepers
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)
Finders keepers, losers weepers
(Double-double-double down, pushing it all in)
