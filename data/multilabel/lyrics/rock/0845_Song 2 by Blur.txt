Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo
Woo-hoo

[Verse 1]
I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, no

[Chorus]
(Woo-hoo) When I feel heavy metal
(Woo-hoo) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woo-hoo) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time, but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you
[Verse 2]
I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem

[Chorus]
(Woo-hoo) When I feel heavy metal
(Woo-hoo) And I'm pins and I'm needles
(Woo-hoo) Well, I lie and I'm easy
All of the time, but I'm never sure why I need you
Pleased to meet you
