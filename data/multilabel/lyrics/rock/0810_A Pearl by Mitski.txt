You're growing tired of me
You love me so hard and I still can't sleep
You're growing tired of me
And all the things I don't talk about

[Refrain]
Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch

[Chorus]
It's just that I fell in love with a war
And nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Every night, just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go

[Refrain]
Sorry, I don't want your touch
It's not that I don't want you
Sorry, I can't take your touch
[Bridge]
There's a hole that you fill
You fill, you fill
You might also like[Chorus]
But it's just that  I fell in love with a war
And nobody told me it ended
And it left a pearl in my head
And I roll it around
Every night, just to watch it glow
Every night, baby, that's where I go
Just to watch it glow
