Under the weight of a broken nose
It's not that simple, but he won't seem to notice
There must be more to this
So leave those sink estates, and let's book a holiday
We're painting all the counties in blue
'Cause we're already boring, and we're already hoarding
What else have we got left to accrue?

[Chorus]
And the ramblers will say
"It's got a marvellous view!"
But they don't know how many lives it took, no
Thеy'll never know what you knew

[Refrain]
And wе're so calm, but we're— (Fucking scared, fucking scared!)
And we're so calm, but we're— (Fucking scared, fucking scared!)
And we're so calm, but we're— (Fucking scared, fucking scared!)
And we're so calm, but we're fucking scared of people like you!

[Verse 2]
Under the weight of some Sertraline
A couple Prozacs, and now I'm pumping dopamine!
There must be more to this
We've got a country house now, old dog has been put down now
It's nice to be around trees
Custom license plate on our Audi R8
How many grocers does one county need?
You might also like[Chorus]
And the ramblers will say
"It's still a marvellous view!"
But that treadmill still looms
Of your hedonic misuse

[Instrumental Break]

[Breakdown]
So come on, one and all and see the apathy!
The reams of grey stencils that fill the tapestry
I look to all of you and see a different fucking species!
Aspiration for a different destination to me
Across the Pennines, there's a thin blue line, a knife and a mall
I would do something, if it wasn't all so effort-full
'Cause I'm so high,  my brain can't even look at the fall
And when you've reached the top, there's nowhere else to go but...

[Outro]
