[CHRISTINE]
In sleep, he sang to me, in dreams he came
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name
And do I dream again? For now, I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind

[PHANTOM]
Sing once again with me, our strange duet
My power over you grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me to glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind

[CHRISTINE]
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

[PHANTOM]
It's me they hear…

[CHRISTINE, PHANTOM]
Your spirit and my voice
My spirit and your voice
You might also like[CHRISTINE & PHANTOM]
In one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there

[CHRISTINE, PHANTOM]
Inside my mind
Inside your mind

[ENSEMBLE]
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Beware, the Phantom of the Opera
[PHANTOM]
In all your fantasies, you always knew
That man and mystery

[CHRISTINE]
Were both in you

[CHRISTINE & PHANTOM]
And in this labyrinth, where night is blind

[CHRISTINE, PHANTOM]
The Phantom of the Opera is here
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind…
Inside your mind…
[PHANTOM]
Sing, my Angel of Music!

[CHRISTINE]
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera

[CHRISTINE vocalizing]

[PHANTOM]
Sing!
Sing for me
Sing, my Angel of Music!
Sing for me!
I have brought you
To the seat of sweet music's throne
To this kingdom where all must pay homage to music
Music…

You have come here
For one purpose and one alone
Since the moment I first heard you sing
I have needed you with me to serve me, to sing
For my music
My music…
