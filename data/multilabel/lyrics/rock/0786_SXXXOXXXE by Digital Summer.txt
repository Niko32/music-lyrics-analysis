Could you throw it all away?
Another day, another sunrise calls to me
Saying get out of this place
Breaking down has become a part of my life now
But I'm so sick of always having to feel this

[Chorus]
Could you throw away
All of your sick desires
Just to suffocate like me?
And set the whole damn world on fire
Just to suffocate with me
(Suffocate)
Could you throw away
Your sick desires
Just to suffocate like me?
And set the whole damn world on fire
Just to suffocate with me
(Suffocate)

[Post-Chorus]
Just to suffocate with me
Just to suffocate with me
Could you throw away
Could you throw away
You might also like[Outro]
Could you throw away
