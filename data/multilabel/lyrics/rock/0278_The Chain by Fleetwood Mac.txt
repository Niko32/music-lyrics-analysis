(Fuck)

[Verse 1: Lindsey Buckingham & Stevie Nicks]
Listen to the wind blow
Watch the sun rise
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies

[Chorus: Lindsey Buckingham, Both, Stevie Nicks]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin'
You would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
(You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin' (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)

[Verse 2: Lindsey Buckingham & Stevie Nicks]
Listen to the wind blow
Down comes the night
Run in the shadows
Damn your love, damn your lies
Break the silence
Damn the dark, damn the light
You might also like[Chorus: Lindsey Buckingham, Both, Stevie Nicks]
And if you don't love me now
You will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin'
You would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
(You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin' (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)
And if you don't love me now
(You don't love me now)
You will never love me again
I can still hear you sayin' (Still hear you saying)
You would never break the chain
(Never break the chain)

[Outro: Both, Lindsey Buckingham]
Chain keep us together
Run in the shadow
Chain keep us together
Runnin' in the shadow
Chain keep us together
Runnin' in the shadow
Chain keep us together
Run in the shadow
Chain keep us together
Run in the shadow
Chain
