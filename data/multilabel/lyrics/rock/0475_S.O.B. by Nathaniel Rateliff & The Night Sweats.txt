[Verse 1]
I'm gonna need someone to help me
I'm gonna need somebody's hand
I'm gonna need someone to hold me down
I'm gonna need someone to care
I'm gonna writhe and shake my body
I'll start pulling out my hair
I'm going to cover myself with the ashes of you
And nobody's gonna give a damn

[Chorus]
Son of a bitch, give me a drink
One more night
This can't be me
Son of a bitch
If I can't get clean
I'm gonna drink my life away

Now for seventeen years, I've been throwing them back
Seventeen more will bury me
Can somebody please just tie me down?
Or somebody give me a goddamn drink

[Chorus]
Son of a bitch, give me a drink
One more night
This can't be me
Son of a bitch
If I can't get clean
I'm gonna drink my life away
Hey, yeah

My heart was breaking, hands are shaking
Bugs are crawling all over me
My heart was breaking, hands are shaking
Bugs are crawling all over me
My heart was breaking, hands are shaking
Bugs are crawling all over me
My heart was aching, my hands are shaking
Bugs are crawling all over me
[Chorus]
Son of a bitch, give me a drink
One more night
This can't be me
Son of a bitch
If I can't get clean
I'm gonna drink my life away
Son of a bitch, give me a drink
Son of a bitch
This can't be me
Son of a bitch
If I can't get clean
I'm gonna drink my life away
Yeah, ah
