Mustard on the beat, ho

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in unless I'm with my niggas
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My muthafuckin' niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga
Yeah

[Verse 1: YG]
First thing's first, I love all my nigga
This rap shit cracked and I involve my niggas
You lookin' for some lean, lemme call my nigga
He sell it for the high, I need all mine, nigga
Some niggas smoke smoke, some niggas drink drank
Got niggas on the block with the Glock that don't think
I said, "That's a nigga, back up," they in a bucket lapped up
I got to act right if you niggas wanna act up
He talkin' like a snitch, no, that ain't my nigga
He trippin' off a bitch, no, that ain't my nigga
Take a nigga case, yeah, that's my nigga
Know him since I was eight, yeah, that's my nigga
Fucked my first bitch, passed her to my nigga
Hit my first lick, passed with my nigga (My nigga)
Fuck them other niggas 'cause I'm down for my niggas
I ride for my niggas, fuck them other niggas

I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside all day with my niggas

My nigga, my nigga (Dope boys, my niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (YG, my niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (Rich Homie, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (It's the muthafuckin' world)

[Verse 2: Jeezy]
Just know I'm down with the niggas down for me
I got two words for you, love and loyalty
It was me and my nigga, trippin' on a half a B
Then we used to hit a mall and buy everything we see
Me and my down-ass nigga gettin' twisted
Nigga get to trippin', he knock the gravy out your biscuit
Just know I fuck with you the long way, my nigga
So when I see you out I'm like, "Hey, my nigga"
Drink the Act' right by the case with my niggas
Drink the Act' right and get straight with my niggas
Me and my nigga ridin' dirty tryna chase them figures
Who got the yopper, who got the yola? Don't matter, go figure

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in unless I'm with my niggas
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (YG, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (Rich Homie, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my niggas)
[Verse 3: Rich Homie Quan]
My nigga got cake, my nigga got weight
My nigga fronted me, he the reason I'm straight
My nigga got a house, my nigga got a lake
My nigga, we eatin', my nigga get a plate
And we're still hittin' licks with my nigga, my nigga
Runnin' off with a nigga shit with my nigga, my nigga
I fuck a nigga bitch with my nigga, my nigga
If a nigga talkin' shit, then he ain't my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
YG my nigga and I ain't goin' in, ain't tryna leave my niggas
Shawty seein' me and want to leave with a nigga
But it wasn't enough room 'cause I came with my niggas
My niggas, my niggas
I need a set of wings 'cause I'm too fly, nigga
And I'm all about my business like a suit and tie nigga
I ride for my niggas (Believe that)

[Chorus: Rich Homie Quan]
I said that I'ma ride for my motherfuckin' nigga
Most likely I'ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grindin' outside all day with my niggas
And I ain't goin' in unless I'm with my niggas
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My muthafuckin' niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga
Yeah
[Outro]
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
