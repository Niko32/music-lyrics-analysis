[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, he ain't messin' with no average chick, pop, pop
He got Nicki, he know that he hit the jackpot
Every baller tryna score, check them shot clocks
But I hit them with them 'Bron-Iguodala blocks
Eat the cake and he suck on my toes, yes
Hittin' them home runs, I be like "Go Mets"
I want a dude that still kiss me when he mad
Type to cop me diamonds, he can miss me with them bags

[Pre-Chorus: August Alsina, Chris Brown, DJ Khaled]
Girl, we been right here, thinkin' 'bout it all night (Oh)

[Verse 4: Future, Rick Ross]
I'ma do that favor, drippin' flavor in your two piece
I'ma keep my promise, never treat you like a groupie
Calamari dinners, got you eatin' raw sushi
Still in the trap, but I like my bitches bougie
Two cups of styrofoam, excuse me, lil' mama
I can hold you down, be your friend and your lover (Brrrp)
You want watches, new Versaces, you want CÃ©line (Ugh!)
Top back, streamin' money, ain't a T (Boss)

[Verse 5: Rick Ross]
Seen the two G-wagons in my driveway (Woo!)
FaceTime, two black bottles by my fireplace (Ugh!)
Fell out with your peoples, so you took the pictures down (Yeah)
Instagram ain't been the same since you so distant now (Woo!)
Took you shoppin' in other places that I won't name (Boss)
First time your friends really got to see Balmain (Woo!)
Twenty million cash, seen that there with my two eyes (Ugh!)
We the best and I told you this back in '05 (Maybach Music)
