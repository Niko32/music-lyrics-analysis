Come here, big boy
Ah
Mhm
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You've been a bad, bad boy
I'm gonna take my time, so enjoy
There's no need to feel no shame
Relax and sip upon my champagne
'Cause I wanna give you a little taste
Of the sugar below my waist
You nasty boy

[Verse 2]
I'll give you some ooh-la-la
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?
I got you breakin' into a sweat
Got you hot, bothered and wet
You nasty boy (Nasty naughty boy)

[Chorus 1]
Whoa, baby, for all it's worth
I swear I'll be the first to blow your mind
Now if you're ready, come and get me
I'll give you that hot, sweet, sexy lovin' (Lovin')

Hush now, don't say a word
I'm gonna give you what you deserve
Now you better give me a little taste
Put your icing on my cake
You nasty boy (Boy)

[Chorus 2]
Oh no, ooh, there I go again
I need a spankin', 'cause I've been bad
So let my body do the talkin'
I'll slip you that hot, sweet, sexy lovin' (Oh, lovin', ooh, oh)

[Bridge]
Ha
Come on, daddy
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah, hey, oh
Come on, mm, sugar

[Chorus 3]
Ooh, I got you breakin' into a sweat
Got you hot, bothered, and wet
You nasty boy (Nasty naughty boy)
Naughty boy
[Chorus 1]
Baby, for all it's worth
I swear I'll be the first to blow your mind
Now that you're ready, give it to me
Just give me that hot, sweet, sexy lovin'

[Post-Chorus]
Now give me a little spankin', mm
Oh, is that all you've got?
Come on now, don't play with me

[Outro]
Ooh, give me that hot, sweet, nasty
Boy, don't you make me wait
You better give me a little taste
Put your icing on my cake
You nasty boy (Oh)
Mmm
