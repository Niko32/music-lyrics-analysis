The evening fell just like a star, left a trail behind
You spit as you slammed out the door
If this is love, we're crazy, as we fight like cats and dogs
I just know there's got to be more

[Chorus]
Please call me, baby, wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded, everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold out walking in the rain

[Verse 2]
I admit that I ain't no angel, I admit that I ain't no saint
I'm selfish and I'm cruel, but you're blind
If I exorcise my devils, well, my angels may leave too
When they leave, they're so hard to find

[Chorus]
Please call me, baby, wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded, everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold out walking in the rain

[Verse 3]
We're always at each others throats, you know, it drives me up the wall
Most of the time I'm just blowing off steam
And I wish to God you'd leave me, baby, I wish to God you'd stay
Life's so different than it is in your dreams
You might also like[Chorus]
Please call me, baby, wherever you are
It's too cold to be out walking in the streets
We do crazy things when we're wounded, everyone's a bit insane
I don't want you catching your death of cold out walking in the rain
