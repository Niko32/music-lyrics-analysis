Well, I'm a voodoo chile
Lord, I'm a voodoo chile
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Well, the night I was born
Lord, I swear the moon turned a fire red
The night I was born
I swear the moon turned a fire red
Well, my poor mother cried out "Lord, the gypsy was right"
And I've seen her, fell down right dead
(Have mercy)

[Verse 2]
Well, mountain lions found me there waitin'
And set me on a eagle's back (Oh, Lord)
Well, mountain lions found me there
And set me on a eagle's wing (Yeah)
(It's the eagle's wing baby, what did I say)
Well uh, he took me past to the outskirts of infinity
And when he brought me back
He gave me a Venus witch's ring
Hey, (Yeah) and he said "Fly on, fly on"

[Chorus]
Because I'm a voodoo chile, baby
Voodoo chile, hey
Yeah

Well, I make love to you
And Lord knows you'll feel no pain, yeah
Say, I make love to you in your sleep
And Lord knows you felt no pain
(Have mercy)
'Cause I'm a million miles away
And at the same time, I'm right here in your picture frame
(Yeah, what did I say now?)

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile
Yeah

[Verse 4]
Yeah, well my arrows are made of desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulphur mines
Say my arrows are made of desire, desire
From far away as Jupiter's sulphur mines
Way down by the Methane Sea, yeah
I have a hummingbird and it hums so loud
You think you were losing your mind, hmm

[Verse 5]
Well I float in liquid gardens
And Arizona new red sand
(Yeah)
I float in liquid gardens
Way down in Arizona red sand (Yeah now, baby)
Well, I taste the honey from a flower named Blue
Way down in California
And the New York drowns as we hold hands
Yeah, hey

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm a voodoo chile
Lord knows I'm a voodoo chile
Yeah
