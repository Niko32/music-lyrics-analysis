Don't ya know? You're beautiful
You're different, unusual
I love your style, it's original
Seem so unreal, like you're mythical

Don't ya know?
Girl, don't ya know?
Hey, don't ya know?
I know you know

[Verse]
Baby I know that you don't see yourself as one of them
But honestly, girl, I believe that you're a hundred out of ten
You've been going through some things (I want you to feel better)
And if you're feeling cold (Here, put on my sweater)
But when you're feeling down (I hope you can remember)
I hope you can remember this

[Chorus]
Don't ya know? You're beautiful
You're different, unusual
I love your style, it's original
Seem so unreal, like you're mythical

Don't ya know?
Girl, don't ya know?
Hey, don't ya know?
I know you knowYou might also like
