Now, you heard the rest
Ah boys, I'm gonna show you the best
Ma Rainey's gonna show you her black bottom

[Verse]
Way down south in Alabamy
I got a friend they call dancin' Sammy
Who's crazy about all the latest dancin'
Black Bottom Stomp and the [?] prancin'
The other night at a swell affair
Soon as the boys found out that I was there
He said, "Come on, Ma, let's go to the cabaret"
When I got there you oughta hear me say

[Chorus]
Want to see the dance you call the black bottom
I wanna learn that dance
Want to see the dance you call your big black bottom
That puts you in a trance
All the boys in the neighborhood
They say your black bottom is really good
Come on and show me your black bottom
I wanna learn that dance

[Chorus]
I want to see the dance you call the black bottom
I wanna learn that dance
Come on and show the dance you call your big black bottom
It puts you in a trance
Early last morning 'bout the break of day
Grandpa told my grandmother, heard him say
"Get over here and you show the old man your black bottom
I want to learn that dance"
You might also like[Chorus]
Now I'm gonna show y'all my black bottom
They pay to see that dance
Wait until you see me do my big black bottom
It puts you in a trance
Ah, do it Ma, do it, honey
Look out now Ma, you gettin' kinda rough there
You better be yourself now, careful now
Not too strong, not too strong, Ma
I done showed y'all my black bottom
You ought to learn that dance
