Underestimated technology
I'm addicted to tablet screens
No escaping battleground PUBG
Computer games ain't for me

[Chorus]
Can't relate face to face with modern day youth
Outdated, the post-millennial will get you
I was born in the echo boom
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial

[Post-Chorus]
I was only born in '92
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial
The cruel millennial

[Verse 2]
White dog shit, not on my nature strip
Calcium bone conspiracist
Berenstein Bears read to as kids
It's a glitch in the matrix

[Chorus]
Can't relate face to face with modern day youth
Outdated, the post-millennial will get you
I was born in the echo boom
Yet I rust as the cruel millennial
You might also like[Refrain]
The cruel millennial
The cruel millennial
The cruel millennial
The cruel millennial
The cruel millennial
The cruel millennial
