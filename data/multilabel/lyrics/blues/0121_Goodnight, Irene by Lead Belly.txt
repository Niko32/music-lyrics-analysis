I asked your mother for you
She told me that you was too young
I wish dear Lord that I'd never seen your face
I'm sorry you ever were born

[Chorus]
Irene good night
Irene good night
Good night Irene, good night Irene
I guess you're in my dreams

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I live in the country
Sometimes I live in town
Sometimes I haves a great notion
Jumping in, into the river and drown

[Chorus]
Irene good night
Irene good night
Good night Irene, good night Irene
I guess you're in my dreams

[Verse 3]
Stop ramblin' and stop gamblin'
Quit staying out late at night
Go home to your wife and family
Stay there by the fireside bright
You might also like[Chorus]
Irene good night
Irene good night
Good night Irene, good night Irene
I guess you're in my dreams

[Verse 4]
I love Irene, God knows I do
I love her 'til the sea runs dry
If Irene turns her back on me
I'm gonna take morphine and die
