Mercy me, the night is long
Take my pen to write you this song
Lord, is it harder to carry on
Or to know when you are done?

[Verse 2]
All my life, I've felt as though
I'm inside a beautiful memory replaying
With the sound turned down low

[Chorus 1]
Long-life, show your face
Slow-heart, curb your taste
Smoke me out of my hiding place
Long-life, state your case

[Verse 3]
What in the world are we waiting for?
Building glowing cities 'long the shore
Where the wind batters in
Baiting my kin like a matador

[Verse 4]
So much value placed upon
What lies just beyond our plans
Waving my handkerchief, running along
'Til the end of the sand
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Long-life, speak your name
So tired of the guessing game
But something is moving just out of frame
Slow heart, brace and aim

[Verse 5]
Breaching slowly, 'cross the sea
One mast, flash like the stinger of a bee
To take you away, a swarming fleet
Is gonna take you from me

[Verse 6]
The universe is getting loose
Sodden spread from some leaden disuse
Rushing, unhinged towards diminishing lights
Like a headless caboose

[Verse 7]
I'll wait for you alongside the ocean
And make do with my no-skin
But then, long-life, will you let me in?
And then, slow-heart, are you gonna know him?

[Chorus 3]
Long-life, speak your name
I wait while I decry the wait
And when I die, may I relate
Slow heart, congregate
[Verse 8]
To leave your home, and your family
For some distortion of property?
Well, darling, I can't go
But you may stay here with me
