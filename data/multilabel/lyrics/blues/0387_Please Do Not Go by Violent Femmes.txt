Tell you, man, I'm stuck on this lovely girl
'Cause to me, she mean all the world
But then she like another guy
I fall down dead, she never see the tears I cry

[Refrain]
Said, "Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go"

[Chorus]
How long can the days go on (Oh-woah-woah)
When my love is so strong? (Oh-woah-woah)
And I know I cannot tell a lie, oh-woah-woah
I wanna see him go bye (Goodbye), bye (Goodbye)
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

[Verse 2]
Now, I wonder, I wonder what she would say
If I told her, if I told her that I felt this way
You know, it might make her turn, might make her turn, might make her turn either way
So all I can do is patiently pray, pray, pray, pray, pray

[Refrain]
Sayin', "Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go"

How long can the days go on (Oh-woah-woah)
When my love is so strong? (Oh-woah-woah)
And I know I cannot tell a lie, oh-woah-woah
I wanna see him go bye (Goodbye), bye (Goodbye)
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

[Bridge]
I'll tell you, man, I'm stuck
I'm stuck, I'm stuck on this lovely girl
And you know, I could travel
I could travel all over the whole world
And you know what she does, she turn around
She turn around, she like another guy
Oh, what can I do? I fall down dead
She never see the tears I cry

[Outro]
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please, you hurt me so
Please, please, please, you hurt me so
Please, please, please, I've got something to show you
Please, please, please, I've got something to show you
