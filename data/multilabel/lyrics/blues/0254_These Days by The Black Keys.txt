My hand to God, I didn't mean to
After all, look what we've been through
Men come in different shades
That's how we're made
The little house on Ellis Drive
Is where I felt most alive
The oak tree covered that old Ford
I miss it Lord, I miss it Lord

[Chorus]
These blood red eyes don't see so good
But what's worse is if they could
Would I change my ways?
Wasted times and broken dreams
Violent colors so obscene
It's all I see these days, these days

[Verse 2]
Watch what you say, the devil is listenin'
He's got ears that you wouldn't believe
And, brother, once you go to him
It's your soul you can never, never, never retrieve

[Chorus]
These blood red eyes don't see so good
But what's worse is if they could
Would I change my ways?
Wasted times and broken dreams
And violent colors so obscene
It's all I see these days, these days
You might also like[Outro]
(Hey)
These days, all I see these days
See these days, all I see
