I know, I know I've been changed
I, I know I've been changed Lord and I know
I know I've been changed
The angels in Heaven done signed my name
The angels in Heaven done signed my name
X2

[Verse 1]
One day, one day I was walking along
The angels in Heaven done signed my name
I heard a voice I didn't see no one
The angels in Heaven done signed my name
That voice to me you know it sounded so sweet
The angels in Heaven done signed my name
It sounded like Jesus was talking to me
The angels in Heaven done signed my name

[Chorus]
I know, I know I've been changed
I, I know I've been changed Lord and I know
I know I've been changed
The angels in Heaven done signed my name
The angels in Heaven done signed my name

[Verse 2]
Well I know I got my ticket in my right hand
The angels in Heaven done signed my name
I'm on my way to the promise land
The angels in Heaven done signed my name
If you don't believe that I've been redeemed
The angels in Heaven done signed my name
Just follow me down to the Jordan stream
The angels in Heaven done signed my name
You might also like[Chorus]
And I know, I know I've been changed
I, I know I've been changed Lord and I know
I know I've been changed
The angels in Heaven done signed my name
The angels in Heaven done signed my name
The angels in Heaven done signed my name
