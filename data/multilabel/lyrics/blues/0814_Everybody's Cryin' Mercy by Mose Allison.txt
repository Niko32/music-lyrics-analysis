I can't believe the things I'm seeing
I wonder 'bout some things I've heard
Everybody's crying mercy
When they don't know the meaning of the word

[Verse 2]
A bad enough situation
It's sure enough getting worse
Everybody's crying justice
Just as long as it's business first

[Bridge 1]
Toe to toe
Touch and go
Give a cheer
Get your souvenir

[Verse 3]
People running 'round in circles
Don't know what they're headed for
Everybody's crying peace on earth
Just as soon as we win this war

[Bridge 2]
Straight ahead
Knock 'em dead
Pack your kit
Choose your hypocrite
You might also like[Verse 4]
You don't have to go to off-Broadway
To see something plain absurd
Everybody's crying mercy
When they don't know the meaning of the word
Nobody knows the meaning of the word
