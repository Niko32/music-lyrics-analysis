Baby
Ooh, baby
Baby, baby (Baby)
Ooh, um, baby
Oh, baby
We need to, um, talk about where
We're taking this thing
How far we're gonna let this go (Oh, baby)
We've been here before (Oh, baby)
It's getting late

[Chorus: Marsha]
It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
I'm afraid, don't be
I'm afraid, don't be
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me, twice
Baby, oh baby baby baby

[Verse 1: Natalie, Marsha]
Listen
I've already been thinking about you on my mind
Far too often for you to be here at this time (Baby)
You see, one hands on mine, and the others on my thigh (Oh, baby)
Oh, baby
Look, I already played with the idea of you
Being here in the morning (Mmm, baby)
And the position for the crack of dawn (Mmm, baby)
And the conversation before the yawning (Oh, ah, baby)
But aah, it's getting late (Oh, baby)
It's getting late
You might also like[Chorus: Marsha, Floetry, Natalie]
It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, (You say) don't be
But I'm afraid, (You say) don't be
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me twice
Oh, baby, baby, baby

[Verse 2: Natalie, Marsha]
How's about I let you touch the space
That you left behind (Oh, ah, baby)
The day that you stop smiling
The day that the tears started falling (Oh, ooh, baby)
But now we're talking (Mmm, baby)
Touching, almost making sensual again (Oh, oh, oh, baby)
We can taste the familiar (Oh, mmm, baby)
Cause, the family hour supports it of this moment (Oh, oh, baby)
But was led by the movements (Oh, oh, baby)
'Cause ah, it's getting late (Mmm, baby)

[Chorus: Marsha, Floetry, Natalie]
It's getting late
Why you gotta be here?
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, (You say) don't be
But I'm afraid, (You say) don't be
I'm so scared that you'll hurt me twice
Oh, baby, baby, baby
[Refrain: Marsha]
Oh, baby, twice, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Oh, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Oooh, baby

[Verse 3: Natalie, Marsha]
I see the memories we replayed (Mm, baby)
Same space, face, bodies
(Oh oh, baby)
I know there's a method to your manliness (Oh oh, baby)
But ah I'm a afraid
(Oh oh, baby)

[Chorus: Marsha, Natalie, Floetry]
It's getting late (It's getting late)
Why you gotta be here? Oh
Beside me
Watching, needing, wanting me
But I'm afraid, you say don't be
But I'm afraid, and you say don't be
I'm afraid that you're gonna hurt me baby, baby
Twice baby, good baby, baby, baby
Twice baby, oh, baby, baby
Ooooh baby
[Refrain: Marsha]
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (Baby, please)
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge: Marsha, Natalie]
I see the memories replayed
Same space, same face, same bodies, baby (Baby)
I know this method to your manliness
But I'm afraid (Afraid), babe
I see the memories replayed (Yeah)
Same space, same face (Same face)
Same bodies, baby (Baby)
I know this method to your manliness
But I'm afraid, baby

[Outro: Marsha]
Baby, baby, baby, baby (I'm afraid)
Baby, baby, baby, baby
(Baby, don't hurt me, oh, I'm about to cry)
Baby, baby, baby, baby (I'm about to cry for you, baby)
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Please don't hurt me baby
I'm afraid, baby
Please don't hurt me baby
I'm afraid, baby
Don't hurt me baby
Please don't hurt me
I'm afraid, babe
Please don't hurt me, baby
I'm afraid, babe
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
I'm afraid
