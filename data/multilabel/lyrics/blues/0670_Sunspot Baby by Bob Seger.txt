She packed up her bags and she took off down the road
She left me here stranded with the bills she owed
She gave me a false address
Took off with my American Express
Sunspot baby
She sure had me way outguessed

[Verse 2]
She left me here stranded like a dog out in the yard
Charged up a fortune on my credit card
She used my address and my name
Man that was sure unkind
Sunspot baby
She sure had a real good time

[Bridge]
I looked in Miami
I looked in Negril
The closest I came was a month old bill
I checked the Bahamas and they said she was gone
Can't understand why she did me so wrong

[Verse 3]
But she packed up her bags, she took off down the road
She said she was going to visit sister Flo
She used my address and my name
And man that was sure unkind
Sunspot baby
I'm gonna catch up sometime
Sure had a real good time
(Oh, yeah, oh, ooh)

[Verse 4]
But she packed up her bags and she took off down the road
She left me here stranded with the bills she owed
She used my address and my name
Put my credit to shame
Sunspot baby
Sure had a real good time
Oh, sunspot baby
She sure had a real good time
Yeah, sunspot baby

[Outro]
(Yeah, ooh)
