I remember you walked out the door
So I stayed awake for days
No pill or drink could get me off the floor
Nothing seemed to ease the pain

[Pre-Chorus]
Listen to me, honey
I've got something new to say
I forgive, but can't forget your mistakes
Now I think it's time for you to pay

[Chorus]
Oh, he's Mr. Hughes and he's got the blues
'Cause his high school dreams, they never went too far
Ayy, he's Mr. Hughes and he's got the blues
'Cause he missed his chance to be with a star, ayy

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Mr. Hughes, I ain't missin' you, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha

[Verse 2]
This is for the times you broke my heart
And all the years you led me on
Now you're asking for a brand new start
But you're way too late and now I'm gone, ooh-ooh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Listen to me, honey
I've got something new to say
I forgive, but can't forget your mistakes
Now I think it's time for you to pay

[Chorus]
Oh, he's Mr. Hughes and he's got the blues
'Cause his high school dreams, they never went too far
Ayy, he's Mr. Hughes and he's got the blues
'Cause he missed his chance to be with a star, ayy

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Mr. Hughes, I ain't missin' you
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Mr. Hughes, I ain't missin' you

[Bridge]
(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
How could you think I'm so stupid?
I wouldn't see through?
I always do
Now I got a new man
And he's ten times the man you could ever be, Mr. Hughes (Ooh)
[Chorus]
Oh, he's Mr. Hughes and he's got the blues (He's got the blues)
'Cause his high school dreams, they never went too far (Never went too far)
Ayy, he's Mr. Hughes and he's got the blues (Ooh-ooh)
'Cause he missed his chance to be with a star, ayy

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh, yeah), oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Mr. Hughes, I ain't missin' you, ayy
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, woah-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Mr. Hughes, I ain't missin' you (Oh, yeah)
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh)
Mr. Hughes, I ain't missin' you, ha-ha-ha-ha
