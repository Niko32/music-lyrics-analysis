Mama's so strong, but her body's tired
But she jumps up to hug me when I come home
And Dad hates to smoke, but he chews tobacco
And he taught me to find God on my own
And Kendall is no stranger to trouble
But her boys are gonna love that crazy soul
Oh, and Britney's still scared from after Banner
But if Andrew was here, he'd be proud of her

[Chorus]
So, maybe love was always near
Maybe love needs the fear
Well, maybe love is a broken thing
Maybe love needs the pain

[Verse 2]
So I chainsmoke the pack in Salt Lake City
And your voice sounds the same when I'm alone
I was drunk at the wheel in Norfolk, Virginia
Oh, and I came to tears thinking of her
Oh, and darling, I know that I haven't told you
But you mean more to me than you must know
But my head's full of fear and my heart of sorrow
But when I'm patient enough, your voice echoes
You might also like[Chorus]
So, maybe love was always near
Maybe love needs the fear
Well, maybe love is a broken thing
Maybe love needs the pain

[Outro]
It's carrying you up, it's carrying you up
Don't let it grow lonesome, fly away
It's carrying you up, it's carrying you up
Don't let it grow lonesome, fly away
