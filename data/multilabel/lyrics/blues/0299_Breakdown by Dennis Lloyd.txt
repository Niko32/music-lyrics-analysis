Baby you should know
I've got my life off the road
Since you're gone
Drinking all night long
Bitches lay where you belong
Now I'm trying to become a better me
Better than I used to be
Better than now for sure

[Pre-Chorus]
Like you do, like you do, like you do, like you do
Trying to find my way
Find my way back home
Like you do, like you do, like you do, like you do
When we fall down
Ohh baby girl when you talk like that
When you walk like that
Ohh baby girl when you dance like that
When you love like that

[Verse 2]
A hundred fuckin miles separates
Between me and my girl
And all I need to know is if my girl is gone for real
Coming back to the place where it all began
Bitches in my bed again
Maybe I don't need to feel
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Like you do, like you do, like you do, like you do
Trying to find my way
Find my way back home
Like you do, like you do, like you do, like you do
When we fall down

[Chorus]
Ohh baby girl when you talk like that
When you walk like that
Ohh baby girl when you dance like that
When you love like that

[Bridge]
Going every night tryna find bitches to impress
Gotta love the emptiness
Gettin' high through every fear
Bitches layin' on the floor passin' out again
Puke the money that they've spent
Baby I don't need to feel

[Pre-Chorus]
Like you do, like you do, like you do, like you do
Trying to find my way
Find my way back home
Like you do, like you do, like you do, like you do
When we fall down
[Chorus]
Ohh baby girl when you talk like that
When you walk like that
Ohh baby girl when you dance like that
When you love like that
