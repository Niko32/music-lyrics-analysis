My baby gone and left me crying by myself
My baby gone and left me crying by myself

[Refrain]
I loved another woman - I lost my best gal

[Verse 2]
She was a real good woman, she didn't mean me no harm
She was a real good woman, she wouldn't do me no harm

[Refrain]
But I loved another woman - now she's up and she's gone

[Guitar solo: Peter Green]

[Verse 3]
Well come back baby, I know I treated you wrong
Well come back baby, I know I treated you wrong

[Refrain]
I loved another woman - now, I won't do that no more

[Outro]
