I can feel my brain a-changing
Acclimating to the madness
I can feel my outrage shift into a dull, despondent sadness
I can feel a crust growing over my eyes
Like a falcon hood

[Refrain]
I've got the normalization blues
This isn't normal, this isn't good

[Verse 2]
I'm detached and I'm distracted, all keyed up but unproductive
Vacillating between being all excited and disgusted
And then dozing lackadaisically
In this bubble where I've made my mental home

[Refrain]
Connection's more important now than it ever was
But I'd rather be alone

[Verse 3]
And when we talk about the President
We're either pissed off or we're giggling
About an atrocity he's committing
Or some stupid shit he's tweeting
He's a symptom and a weapon of the evil men who really run the show
The ones who melt down human beings into money like a cruel Sorcerer's Stone
And they try to divide us, and largely they're succeeding
'Cause they've undermined our confidence in the news that we are reading
And they make us fight each other with our faces buried deep inside our phones
You might also like[Refrain]
Rest in peace to the Information Age, those days are now long dead and gone

[Verse 4]
I can see the weather changing
And I can feel the soul decaying
I'm observing drastic changes in the way we're all behaving
I can see the sooth they're saying
Furthermore, I could believe it to be true

[Refrain]
Connection's more important now than it ever was
Buddy, what are you gonna do?

[Outro]
This is the golden age of dickotry
Probably the last golden age of anything
And the ugliest word in the English language is "Anthropocene"
Good luck everybody
Good luck!
