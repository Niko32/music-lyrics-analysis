New Jersey turnpike
Ridin' on a wet night
'Neath the refinery's glow
Out where the great black rivers flow

[Verse 2]
License, registration
I ain't got none
But I got a clear conscience
'Bout the things that I done

[Chorus]
Mister State Trooper
Please don't stop me
Please don't stop me
Please don't stop me

[Verse 3]
Maybe you got a kid
Maybe you got a pretty wife
The only thing that I got's
Been botherin' me my whole life

[Chorus]
Mister State Trooper
Please don't stop me
Please don't stop me
Please don't stop me

Gonna lead me to my baby

'Til you lose your patience

[Chorus]
Mister State Trooper
Please don't stop me

[Verse 6]
Hey, somebody out there
Listen to my last prayer
Hi ho silver-o
Deliver me from nowhere

[Outro]
Hi ho
