Oh I'm gonna start shootin' again
Go bring me my shotgun
You know I just got to start shootin' again
You know I'm gonna shoot my woman
Cause she's foolin' around with too many men

Yes bring me my shotgun
Yes man and a pocket full of shells
Yes go bring me my shotgun
Yes man and a pocket full of shells
Yeah you know I'm gonna kill that woman
I'm gonna throw her in that old deep dug well
Hide her from everybody they won't know where she at

That woman said Lightnin' you can't shoot me
She said now you is dead of tryin'
I don't take a day off for nobody
She said Lightnin' you can't shoot me
She said yes and you dare to try
I said the only reason I don't shoot you little woman
My double barrel shotgun, it just won't fireYou might also like
