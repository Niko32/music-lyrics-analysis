Mmm, mmm

[Verse 1]
There's something bout the rain
Must be something in the water
Run away, I can't help but wonder when the weather's gon' change
Let go of the sadness
Lingers on its own
You dug it by yourself, can't get out alone
Depressed for a while, couldn't find my smile
Couldn't find a fuck to give, but fuck this

[Chorus]
The same outside, nothing to change my mind
The water, run away, run away, run away
There's something bout the rain
Something 'bout the rain
Something 'bout the rain
Something 'bout the rain

[Verse 2]
Yet another misty day
I'm back again, run away
Fallen with the freedom, I can't find a reason to stay
Runnin' from it all, I always seem to fall
And the nightmares they came true, I pulled through
Another language, you're happy and I'm sad
It shouldn't have to feel so bad
You might also like[Chorus]
The same outside, nothing to change my mind
The water, run away, run away, run away
There's something 'bout the rain
Something 'bout the rain
Something 'bout the rain
Something 'bout the rain

[Outro]
Something 'bout the rain
There's something 'bout the rain
Something 'bout the rain
Something 'bout the rain
Something 'bout the rain
