Well, he ran around late at night
Holdin' hands, makin' light
Of everything that came before
But there she was behind the door

[Chorus]
She hit them with her ten cent pistol
Because they ruined her name
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol
And they've never been the same

[Verse 2]
There is nothing worse in this world
Then payback from a, a jealous girl
The laws of man, they don't apply
When blood gets in a, a woman's eye

[Chorus]
Well she hit them with her ten cent pistol
Because they ruined her name
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol
And they've never been the same
The same, oh

[Instrumental Bridge]

Stars did fall, thunder rolled
Bugs crawled back in their holes
The couple screamed, but it was far too late
A jealous heart did retaliate

[Chorus]
She hit them with her ten cent pistol
Because they ruined her name
Well, she hit them with her ten cent pistol
And they've never been the same

[Outro]
Oh, the same
Oh, the same
Never been the same
(The same)
