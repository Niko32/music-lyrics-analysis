She told me where I could go
Just stopped in here before I went
And I'll be here until you close
Or all my money's spent
So if you don't mind my friend

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Chris Stapleton]
Bartender, pour me one more
Make it quick and make it strong
'Cause buddy, my last drink, yeah
Ain't the only thing that's gone

[Verse 2: Chris Stapleton, Morgan Wallen, Chris Stapleton & Morgan Wallen]
Here's a hundred and some change
I'll take whatever that'll buy
Leave a twenty for the band
If they'll lay off lonesomе songs tonight
And whenever you gеt time

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Chris Stapleton]
Bartender, pour me one more
Make it quick and make it strong
'Cause buddy, my last drink, yeah
Ain't the only thing that's gone
Oh no

[Chorus: Morgan Wallen & Chris Stapleton]
Bartender, pour me one more
Make it quick and make it strong
'Cause buddy, my last drink, yeah
Ain't the only thing that's gone

[Outro: Morgan Wallen & Chris Stapleton]
And I ain't got nowhere to be
And I'd rather not go home
'Cause buddy, my last drink, yeah
Ain't the only thing that's gone
