I wanna tell you 'bout a dance
That's goin' around
Everybody doin' it
From the grown ups, down

[Chorus]
Don't have to move yo' head
Don't have to move yo' hands
Don't have to move yo' lips
Just shake yo' hips

And do the hip shake, baby
And do the hip shake, baby
Do the hip shake, baby
Shake yo' hips, baby

[Verse 2]
Now, if you don't know
Don't be afraid
Just listen to me
And do what I said

[Chorus]
Don't move yo' head
Don't move yo' hands
Don't move yo' lips
Just shake yo' hips
You might also likeDo the hip shake, baby
Do the hip shake, baby
Do the hip shake, baby
Shake yo' hips, baby
Now, ain't this ee-e-e-e-ee-easy?

[Verse 3]
Well, I met a little girl
In a country town
She says, 'What'd you know?'
'There's, Slim Harpo'

[Chorus]
I didn't move my head
I didn't move my hands
I didn't move my lips
She shook her hips

She did a hip shake, baby
Did her hip shake, baby
Did her hip shake, baby
Shake yo' hips, baby
Now, ain't this ee-e-e-e-ee-easy?
