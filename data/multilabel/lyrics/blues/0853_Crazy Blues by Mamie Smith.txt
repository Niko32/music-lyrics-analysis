I can't eat a bite
'Cause the man I love
He don't treat me right

He makes me feel so blue
I don't know what to do
Sometime I sit and sigh
And then begin to cry
'Cause my best friend
Said his last goodbye

There's a change in the ocean
Change in the deep blue sea, my baby
I'll tell you folks, there ain't no change in me
My love for that man will always be

Now I can read his letters
I sure can't read his mind
I thought he's lovin' me
He's leavin' all the time
Now I see my poor love was blind

Now I got the crazy blues
Since my baby went away
I ain't got no time to lose
I must find him today
You might also likeNow the doctor's gonna do all that he can
But what you're gonna need is an undertaker man
I ain't had nothin' but bad news
Now I got the crazy blues

Now I can read his letters
I sure can't read his mind
I thought he's lovin' me
He's leavin' all the time
Now I see my poor love was blind

I went to the railroad
Hang my head on the track
Thought about my daddy
I gladly snatched it back
Now my babe's gone
And gave me the sack

Now I've got the crazy blues
Since my baby went away
I ain't had no time to lose
I must find him today

I'm gonna do like a Chinaman
Go and get some hop
Get myself a gun, and shoot myself a cop
I ain't had nothin' but bad news
Now I've got the crazy blues
