Do you feel like you're the only one living on a prayer?
Have you ever tried to love someone who wasn't even there?

[Pre-Chorus]
No one really knows
Where it goes from here
But we all decompose
And slowly disappear

[Chorus]
If evil lays its hands on me
Shine a little light on my soul
Show me things I cannot see
Shine a little light on my soul

[Verse 2]
Go to places that you used to go
But they don't feel the same
See the faces that you used to know
But they forget your name

[Pre-Chorus]
No one really knows
Where it goes from here
But we all decompose
And slowly disappear
You might also like[Chorus]
If evil lays its hands on me
Shine a little light on my soul
Show me things I cannot see
Shine a little light on my soul

[Chorus]
If evil lays its hands on me
Shine a little light on my soul
I'm waiting, praying, patiently
Shine a little light on my soul
