Wasn't hard to love you
Didn't have to try
Wasn't hard to love you
Didn't have to try

Held you for a little while
My, oh, my, oh my
Held you for a little while
My, oh, my, oh my

Drove you to the station
Never asked you why
Drove you to the station
Never asked you why

Held you for a little while
My, oh, my, oh my
Held you for a little while
My, oh, my, oh my

Wasn't hard to love you
I Didn't have to try
Wasn't hard to love you

Held you for a little while
My, oh, my, oh my
