Hold the line, yeah
Do you fight for pride or glory?
Do you hold your scars close to your heart?
Fall behind, yeah
Who will live to tell your story?
You were taught to leave no man behind

[Chorus]
I don't know where you have gone
You used to be the heart of this town
Now you waste your tears on someone else
I don't know where you are now
You used to have a heart of gold
Only trust yourself and no one else

[Verse 2]
Hold your fire, yeah
Brave young men will fall before they
Ever get to watch their young ones grow
Hear me now, yeah
Carry all my sins and I will
Learn to love the flag and nothing more

[Chorus]
Oh, I don't know where you have gone
You used to be the heart of this town
Wasted all your tears on someone else
I don't know where you are now
You used to have a heart of gold
Only trust yourself and no one else
Oh, no one else

Oh, oh
You've got your back against the wall
Say, where's your backbone, brother?
Where's your backbone, brother?
Where's your backbone, brother?
Where's your backbone, brother?
Where's your backbone, brother?
Where's your backbone, brother?
Where's your backbone, brother?

[Outro]
You've got your back against the wall
Say, where's your backbone, brother?
Where's your backbone, brother?
Where's your backbone, brother?
