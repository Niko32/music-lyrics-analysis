Tight slack-clad girls on the graveyard shift
'Neath the cement stroll, catch the midnight drift
Cigar-chewing Charlie in that newspaper nest
Grifting hot horse tips on who's running the best

[Chorus]
And I'm blinded by the neon
Don't try and change my tune
'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon

[Verse 2]
And the moon's a silver slipper, it's pouring champagne stars
And Broadway's like a serpent pulling shiny top-down cars
Larimer is teeming with that undulated beat
As some Bonneville is screaming its way wildly down the street

[Chorus]
And I'm blinded by the neon
Don't try and change my tune
I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon

[Saxophone and Trumpet Solos]
You might also like[Verse 3]
Hearts flutter and race, the moon's on the wane
Tarts mutter their dream hopes the night will ordain
Come schemers and dancers, cherry delight
As a Cleveland-bound Greyhound, and it cuts through the night

[Chorus]
And I've hawked all my yesterdays
Don't try and change my tune
'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone
I'm drunk on the moon
