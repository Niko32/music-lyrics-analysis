Whoa after midnight

[Verse 1]
Whoa, set me on fire
Whoa, kerosene eyes
Whoa, looking right through me
Selling my soul for one night

Whoa, doin' me dirty
Whoa, telling me lies
Whoa, you are not worthy
Telling myself it's the last time

[Chorus]
Cause nothing good comes after midnight
Ain't no good love come from pain (whoa, whoa)
Nothing good comes after midnight (Ooo-oo-oo-ooo)
When you play the devil's game

Ooooh after midnight

[Verse 2]
Whoa, dragging me under
Whoa, cutting me down to the bone
Whoa, standing on the edge
Falling for a rollin' stone
You might also like[Chorus] (x2)
Cause nothing good comes after midnight (nothing good, nothing good)
Ain't no good love come from pain (whoa, whoa)
Nothing good comes after midnight
(nothing good, ooo-oo-oo-ooo)
When you play the devil's game

[Outro]
Oooooh after midnight
