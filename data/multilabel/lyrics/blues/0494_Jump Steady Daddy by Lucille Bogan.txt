Jump steady, daddy
Please take your time
Jump steady, daddy
Please take your time
You got a year and a day
To satisfy my mind

[Verse 2]
Love me, daddy
Love me all the time
Love me, daddy
Love me all the time
And if you love me like I tell you
You'll be that jump steady man of mine

[Verse 3]
Jump steady got to jumping
Jumping in the rough
Jump steady got to jumping
Jumping in the rough
And I got crazy about him
'Cause he could strut his stuff

[Bridge]
And when Jump Steady starts to jumping
He does it slow
He goes from the top down to the floor
Oh, mmm, just can't let him go
'Cause he jumps better than any man that I know

He don't work on no rock pile
He don't tote no sleigh
He don't work on no rock pile
He don't tote no sleigh
And the way he jumps steady
It's just too bad
