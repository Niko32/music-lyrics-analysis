Heavenly Father up above
Have mercy on me
After 7 years of bad, bad, love
I finally got free
I don't mean to seem ungrateful
You answered my prayers
And, Father, if you're able
Don't let me do the same damn thing all over again

[Chorus]
You get the fever
You get the itch
And you forget about the mess you were in
You forget about the money, the lawyers, and the pain
And do the same damn thing all over again

[Verse 2]
Oh Mighty Father great and good
You need to be in my shoes
You let me fall in love just like before
And now I'm stepping in a big pile of the blues
But now the honeymoon is over
Let's not pretend
I guess I never
Learned my lesson
I did the same damn thing all over again
You might also like[Chorus]
You get the fever
You get the itch
And you forget about the mess you were in
You forget about the money, the lawyers, and the pain
And do the same damn thing all over again

[Verse 3]
Mother Mary, father Joe
I need to talk to your son
He had troubles just like mine
And he's the chosen one
So if I ever go to Heaven, will that be the end?
Or will I fall for some sweet little angel
And do the same damn thing all over again

[Chorus]
You get the fever
You get the itch
And you forget about the mess you were in
You forget about the money, the lawyers and the pain
And do the same damn thing all over, all over, all over

[Chorus]
You get the fever
You get the itch
And you forget about the mess you were in
You forget about the money, the lawyers and the pain
And do the same damn thing all over
