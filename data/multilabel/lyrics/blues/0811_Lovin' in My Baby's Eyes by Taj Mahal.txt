Look here, baby, now you know I can
Be the one to be your man
Baby, now you know I knew I'd do
Anything in the world for you

[Chorus]
To have lovin' from my baby's eyes
Oh, lovin' from my baby's eyes
See that lovin' in my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes

[Verse 2]
Look here, baby, now you know darn well
Love you better than another man could tell
Love you baby, now you know I'd do
Anything in the world for you

[Chorus]
To have lovin' from my baby's eyes
To see lovin' in my baby's eyes
To see lovin' in my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes

[Verse 3]
Late at night when I take my rest
Oh, I hold your pictures to my breast
Love you, baby, now you know I'd do
Anything in the world for you
You might also like[Chorus]
To have lovin' from my baby's eyes
You see the lovin' in my baby's eyes
Have lovin' from my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes

[Bridge]
Love ya baby, love ya baby
Mama, now you know I do
Love ya baby, love ya baby
Do anything for you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
I said, late at night when I take my rest
Oh, I hold you pictures to my breast
Love you, mama, now you know I'd do
Anything in the world for you

[Chorus]
To have lovin' from my baby's eyes
Ooh, lovin' from my baby's eyes
Give me that lovin' in my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes
[Outro]
Give me that magic in my baby's eyes
Ooh, lovin' from my baby's eyes
Give me lovin' from my baby's eyes
Lovin' from my baby's eyes
