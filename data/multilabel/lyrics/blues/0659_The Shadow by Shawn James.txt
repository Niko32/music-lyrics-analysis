There I was just mindin' my own business
When I saw a shadow out the corner of my eye
I'd seen that shadow once before, in my life
Well, it was the day my father died
So, I turned and I fled, but that shadow gave chase
Caught me down a dead end way
To my surprise when he opened his mouth
Well, I could hear my father say
He said, "Son, I know just where you've been, yeah
And I know just how you'll meet your end
You better turn from the path that you're on
Lest you end up just like your old man"
Hold up, wait a minute there man, like
Did you forget who you were? You used to beat my mother down
Well, she left your sorry ass, because you wouldn't choose
Your wife and son over your booze
Now, I ain't a damn thing, yeah
Like the man you used to be
You better go back to where you belong, oh
And maybe then you'll begin to see

[Outro]
Ho, ho, ho-oh-oh-oh, oh!
