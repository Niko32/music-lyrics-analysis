Can't' get another heart too
Then another way come
And I brought you up here, my baby
Don't you love me?
Me
Me
Don't you love me?

[Verse 1]
Didn't I lace her shoes
Just the same as you?
And ain't that my blood in her veins?
Didn't I love her?
Didn't I hold her?
Ain't that my blue in her eyes?

[Chorus]
She don't need another heartbreak
Don't make it 'bout me
No mother should ever let her child bear the hate that she feels

[Post-Chorus]
Please (Please)
Please (Please)
Please, don't take her from me
Don't you love me?
You might also like[Verse 2]
Don't wanna see her grow
Just to be like you
I can't stand your smile on her face
I didn't ask for nothing
I never wanted war
You still have a gun to my head

[Chorus]
She don't need another heartbreak
Don't make it 'bout me
No mother should ever let her child bear the hate that she feels

[Post-Chorus]
Please (Please)
Please (Please)
Please, don't take her from me
Please (Please)
Please (Please)
Please, don't take her from me
(Take her from, take her from, take her from)

[Verse 1]
Didn't I lace her shoes
Just the same as you?
And ain't that my blood in her veins?
Didn't I love her?
Didn't I hold her?
Ain't that my blue in her eyes?
[Chorus]
She don't need another heartbreak
Don't make it 'bout me
No mother should ever let her child bear the hate that she feels
She don't need another heartbreak
Don't make it 'bout me
No mother should ever let her child bear the hate that she feels

[Outro]
No mother should
No mother should
Don't take her from me
(Take her from, take her from, take her from)
