Sing it with me, you shithead

[Verse 1]
They say you know when you know, ooh
What do you do when you don't?
They say in love, it'll happen if it's meant to happen
But what do you do if it don't?

[Pre-Chorus]
Do you ever lie in bed with your three cats
And get obsessed with some boy you met
One time, three years ago in Nashville?
And you can't remember his last name
And think

[Chorus]
Did I fuck my whole life up?
Did I miss my one true love?
Was he right in front of me at the dive bar?
Was that you with the cowboy blues?
You ask me, "Babe, take a chance, come on, just stay"
Why'd I leave you standing there at the dive bar?
I miss you with the cowboy blue suit

[Post-Chorus]
Sha-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, ooh

My therapist said, "Listen, girl, it's a love addiction"
She gave me a book on that (Did you read it? No)
My tarot cards read there's a dead man clinging to my aura
And to let go of the past

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't help that I'm in bed with my three cats
I'm still obsessed with some boy
I shot whiskey with for one night
And I don't remember if he remembers me
While I sit here thinking about him

[Chorus]
Did I fuck my whole life up?
Did I miss my one true love?
Was he right in front of me at the dive bar?
Was that you with the cowboy blues?
You ask me, "Babe, take a chance, come on, just stay"
Why'd I leave you standing there at the dive bar?
I miss you with the cowboy blue suit

[Post-Chorus]
Sha-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, ooh
I miss you with the cowboy blue suit
Sha-la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, ooh
I miss you with the cowboy blue
[Bridge]
Some days, it's easy, some days, it's hard
Sunday's the night that we met at the bar
Laughing and dancing and shooting the shit
What would've happened if I'd had your kids?

[Chorus]
Did I fuck my whole life up?
Did I miss my one true love?
Was he right in front of me at the dive bar?
Was that you with the cowboy blues?
You ask me, "Babe, take a chance, come on, just stay"
Why'd I leave you standing there at the dive bar?
I miss you in the cowboy blue nudie suit
