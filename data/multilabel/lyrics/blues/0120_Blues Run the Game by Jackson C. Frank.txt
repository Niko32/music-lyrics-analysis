Catch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues are all the same

[Verse 2]
Send out for whisky, baby
Send out for gin
Me and room service, honey
Me and room service, babe
Me and room service
Well, we're living a life of sin

[Verse 3]
When I'm not drinking, baby
You are on my mind
When I'm not sleeping, honey
When I ain't sleeping, mama
When I'm not sleeping
You know you'll find me crying

[Verse 4]
Try another city, baby
Another town
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues come following down
You might also like[Verse 5]
Living is a gamble, baby
Loving's much the same
Wherever I have played
Whenever I've thrown them dice
Wherever I have played
The blues have run the game

[Verse 6]
Maybe tomorrow, honey
Someplace down the line
I'll wake up older
So much older, mama
I'll wake up older
And I'll just stop all my tryin'

[Verse 1/Outro]
Catch a boat to England, baby
Maybe to Spain
Wherever I have gone
Wherever I've been and gone
Wherever I have gone
The blues are all the same
