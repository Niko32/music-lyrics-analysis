I was born in the desert
I been down for years
Jesus, come closer
I think my time is near
And I've traveled over
Dry earth and floods
Hell and high water
To bring you my love

[Verse 2]
Climbed over mountains
Traveled the sea
Cast out off heaven
Cast down on my knees
I've lain with the devil
Cursed god above
Forsaken heaven
To bring you my love

[Chorus]
To bring you my love
To bring you my love
To bring you my love

[Bridge]
I know he's gonna be here
He know he's gonna be here
Yeah alright
You might also like[Verse 3]
Forsaken heaven
Cursed god above
Lay with the devil
Bring you my love

[Chorus]
To bring you my love
To bring you my love
To bring you my love
