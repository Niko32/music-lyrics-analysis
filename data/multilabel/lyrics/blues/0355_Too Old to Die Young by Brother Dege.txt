Round and round, round we go
Where it stops? Nobody knows it
Side to side, baby, back and forth
God above and the devil below him
You got your reasons and I got my wants
Still got that feeling, but I'm too old to die young now

[Chorus]
Too old to die young now
Above or below the ground
Just too old to die young now
Still, the good lord might lay me down

[Verse 2]
Round and round, round we go
Where it stops? Nobody knows it
Side to side, baby, down in the hole
God above and the devil below him
You got your reasons and I got my wants
Still got that feeling, but I'm too old to die young now

[Chorus]
Too old to die young now
Above or below the ground
Yes, too old to die young now
Still, the good lord might lay me down
You might also like[Outro]
To lay me down
T-t-to die young now
Too old to die young now
Above or below the ground
Still, the good lord might lay me down
