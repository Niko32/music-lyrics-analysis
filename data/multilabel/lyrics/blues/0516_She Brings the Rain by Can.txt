Yes I care if she brings me spring
But don't care about nothing
She brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain

[Verse 2]
In the dawn of the silvery day
Clouds seem to melt away
She brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain

[Verse 3]
She brings the rain, it feels like spring
Magic mushrooms out of dreams
She brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain

[Verse 4]
So mellow yellow gray disappears
Flying on the raven's wing
She brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain

[Verse 1]
Yes I care, she brings me spring
But don't care about nothing
She brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain
You might also like[Chorus 1]
She brings the rain, it feels like spring
Magic mushrooms out of things
She brings the rain, it feels like spring
She brings the rain, it feels like spring
She brings the rain, it feels like spring
She brings the rain

[Outro]
In the dawn of the silvery day
Clouds seem to melt away
She brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain
Oh yeah, she brings the rain
