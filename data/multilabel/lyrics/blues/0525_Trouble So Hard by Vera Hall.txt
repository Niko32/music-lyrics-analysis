Ooh Lordy, my trouble so hard
Ooh Lordy, my trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my trouble but God
Don't nobody know my trouble but God

[Verse 1]
Went down the hill
Other day
My soul got happy
And stayed all day

[Chorus]
Ooh Lordy, trouble so hard
Ooh Lordy, my trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my trouble but God
Don't nobody know my trouble but God
Ooh Lordy, trouble so hard
Ooh Lordy, my trouble so hard

[Verse 2]
Went in the room
Didn't stay long
Looked on the bed and
Brother was dead
You might also like[Chorus]
Ooh Lordy, trouble so hard
Ooh Lordy, my trouble so hard
Don't nobody know my trouble but God
Don't nobody know my trouble but God
Ooh Lordy, trouble so hard
Ooh Lordy, trouble so hard
