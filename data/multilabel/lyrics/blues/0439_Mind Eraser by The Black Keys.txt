When I need to replace her
I am the mind eraser
Anything goes, yeah, anything goes

[Verse 2]
Got this sin in our brain
But she ain't gonna see me again, see me again
This I know, but oh, deep down
I can't let go

[Chorus]
Oh, don't let it be over, over oh
No, don't let it be over, let it be over, oh

[Verse 3]
Seein' me stack up my woes
Into a wall around a rose, 'round a rose
Now she knows, oh, it hurts so
I can't let go

[Chorus]
Oh, don't let it be over, over oh
No, don't let it be over, let it be over, oh

[Chorus]
Oh, don't let it be over, over oh
No, don't let it be over, let it be over, ohYou might also like
