Spending my money'n I did not care care
Carrying my friends out for a good time
Buyin’ bootleg liquor, champagne and wine
Lord but I got busted and I fell so low
Didn't have no money and nowhere to go
This is the truth, Lord, without a doubt
Nobody wants you when you're down, I mean
Nobody wants you when you’re down

Lord, the other day I asked a man for my rent
He told me, boy, the money he had spent
But I tried my best to try one or two
That's everything that I could do
Lord, nobody let me have one lousy dime
I now get worried now all the time
But I'm gon' tell you this is the truth, Lord, without a doubt
Nobody wants you when you're down
Nobody wants you when you're down

Lord, if I could get my hands on a dollar again
I would hold it till that eagle grins
I would try just for one little house
Nobody knows me when I'm down and out
Lord, I tried for another day
To make troubles in my own way
But I'm gon’ tell you the truth, Lord without a doubt
Nobody knows me when you’re down, I mean
Nobody knows me when you're downYou might also like
