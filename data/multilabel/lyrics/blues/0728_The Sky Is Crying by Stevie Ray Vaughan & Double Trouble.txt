The sky is crying
Can't you see the tears roll down the street
The sky is crying
Can't you see the tears roll down the street
I've been looking for my baby
And I wonder where can she be

[Verse 2]
I saw my baby early one morning
She was walking on down the street
I saw my baby early this morning
She was walking on down the street
You know it hurt me, hurt me so bad
Made my poor heart skip a beat

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I've got a real, real, real, real bad feeling
That my baby, she don't love me no more
I've got a real, real bad feeling
That my baby don't love me no more
You know, this guy, this guy's been crying, yeah
Can't you see the tears roll down my noseYou might also like
