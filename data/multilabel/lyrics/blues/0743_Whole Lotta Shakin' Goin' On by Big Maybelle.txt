Twenty-one drums and an old bass horn
An' somebody beatin' on a ding-dong

[Verse 1]
Come on over, baby
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Come on over, baby
Baby, you can't go wrong
Ain't nobody fakin'
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on

[Verse 2]
Come on over, baby
Whole lotta kickin' in the barn
Come on over, baby
We got the bull by the horns
Everything's kickin'
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on

[Verse 3]
Bakin' and makin' it shake
Door and the floor and the gate
Bakin' it and makin' it shake
Cake and pie on the plate
Shakin', we shakin', we shakin' the place
Come on over, baby, come on
We done found that ding-dong

[Verse 4]
Bakin' and makin' it shake
Door and the floor and the gate
Bakin' it and makin' it shake
Cake and pie on the plate
Bakin' it, makin' it shake
Shakin' it just for taste
Where you go, baby, come on
