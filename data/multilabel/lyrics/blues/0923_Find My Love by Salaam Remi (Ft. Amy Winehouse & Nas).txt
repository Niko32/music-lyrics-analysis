Hey, oh
Yeah
Hey, oh
I'm feeling good, like I should, but, yo

[Chorus: Nas]
Got money on my mind but I still can't find my love
Got money on my mind but I still can't find my love

[Verse 1: Nas]
Dear past, present, and future, the rappin' Fela Kuti
Pockets fat like ya booty, I love it when it's juicy
So meet me at Sweet Chick, the private booth
You got that mac-n-cheese, I swear you're lovin' the truth
Sundays were made for me and you
Farmer's market, play the pool
Curl up on the couch, watch a documentary or two
Smoke curl around my mouth, exhale then put it out
Don't wanna go out, I need a girl up in this house
Oops... correction
I need a woman that know peace of mind's a real bag
A true love I never had
So what the hell am I lookin' for?
Someone who's not bossy and not insecure
Your smile could cure cancer, your frown could start a world war
Somebody to join me while I'm sitting at the shore, sure
You might also like[Chorus: Nas]
Yo, I got money on my mind but I still can't find my love, yeah
I got money on my mind but I still can't find my love

[Verse 2: Nas]
Sexy in her clothes, can't wait to get them off
Lames slide in your DMs, we laughin' at them boys
Comfortable in the Benz, you comfortable while I make ends
Not the jealous type, you comfortable in ya own skin
Funny now, they wanna hear from me, weird
Been away six years, the kid is still hungry
Runnin' through these courses of life, divorced the ex-wife
Made more money, I'm doin' more than alright
Alright, try to figure why am I the guy they can't get rid of
I saw friends come to an abrupt end, I'm outspoken

[Bridge: Nas & Amy Winehouse]
Yeah, hella money on my mind but I still can't find my love
No love, Amy
Yeah
Yeah, Virgo ting, man
Salaam!

[Outro: Nas]
Yeah...
But I still can't find my love (It's a mood right here)
But I still can't find my love
(It's a mood)
