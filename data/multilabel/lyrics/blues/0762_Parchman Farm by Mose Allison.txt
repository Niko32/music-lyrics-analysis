Well, I'm sittin' over here on Parchman Farm
Well, I'm sittin' over here on Parchman Farm
Well, I'm sittin' over here on Parchman Farm
And I ain't never done no man no harm

[Verse 2]
Well, I'm puttin' that cotton in an eleven-foot sack
Well, I'm puttin' that cotton in an eleven-foot sack
Well, I'm puttin' that cotton in an eleven-foot sack
With a twelve guage shotgun at my back

[Piano Solo]

[Verse 3]
I'm sittin' over here on Number Nine
I'm sittin' over here on Number Nine
Well, I'm sittin' over here on Number Nine
And all I did was drink my wine

[Verse 4]
Well, I'm gonna be here for the rest of my life
I'm gonna be on this farm for my natural life
Well, I'm a-gonna be here for the rest of my life
And all I did was shoot my wife
