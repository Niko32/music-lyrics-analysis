Give me your heart, and I'll show you how to feel
Send me your soul, and you'll know what it is to be free
We all need a deeper purpose, one that's true and bold
The only thing that could hurt us is the curse of the fold

[Verse 2]
I once knew a man who had fire in his eyes
Bloody right hand, he had taken his enemies' lives
The past was his torture, the future held his hope
Until he chose his fortune as the curse of the fold

[Chorus]
Although you may feel like giving up
It's not the only road
The path less often traveled
Holds the highest, the highest of hopes

[Verse 3]
Some used to say that I'd never scale this mountain
Now that I'm close, they shut their eyes and draw their curtains
Those who don't believe will always encourage defeat
They'll scream and shout and scold for the curse of the fold

[Chorus 2]
Although I felt like giving up
It's not the road I chose
The path less often traveled
Held the highest, the highest of hopes
Held the highest, the highest of hopesYou might also like
