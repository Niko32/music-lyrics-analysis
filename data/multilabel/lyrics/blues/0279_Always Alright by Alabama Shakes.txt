Well you come upstairs but not to talk
You stay a little while then you do a little walk on home
I hear you downstairs smoking cigarettes
I hear you talking shit
'Cause you ain't got nothing to talk about at all
So you took me to the party and got me to notice
That you wanna feel good and you feel like you're gonna explode
Well I don't care, can't pay attention
And I don't give a damn about your intentions at all

[Verse 2]
Well pass me the whiskey, pass me the gin
Pass me whatever there's drink left in
Well I don't care if it's seven in the morning
For all I care it could be the second coming
Well you say you can't take it anymore
You can't live like this, it's a really big deal
Well I don't care, can't pay attention
And I don't give a fuck about your intentions at all

[Chorus]
We're alright
We're always alright
We're alright
We're always alright
We're alright
We're always alright, alright
We're always alrightYou might also like
