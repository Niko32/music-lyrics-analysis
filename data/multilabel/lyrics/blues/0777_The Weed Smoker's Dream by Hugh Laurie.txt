Can't make no money giving your stuff away
Why don't you do like, like the millionaires do
Put your stuff on the market and make a million too

Face of a betting women, she bets on every hand
She's a tricking mother funk you everywhere she lands
Why don't you do now, like the millionaires do
Put your stuff on the market and make a million too

May's a good looking frail, she lives down by the jail
On the back though she got hot stuff for cell
Why don't you do now, like the millionaires do
Put your stuff on the market and make a million too

Sitting on a million, sitting on it everyday
Can't make no money giving your stuff away
Why don't you do now, like the millionaires do
Put your stuff on the market and make a million too
Put your stuff on the market and make a million... tooYou might also like
