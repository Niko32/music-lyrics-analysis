Woah, shooter, I don't think I'm gonna make it
See, I'm, I'm just as good as dead
(I'm good as dead)

Woah-oh-oh, bullseye
Girl, you shot me down to my knees, yeah
Since you took your love from me
And I'm holding on to the hopes that you will return
Although I feel I've lost you forever
I will believe that you still love me
Girl, say you do, say you do, say you do
(Say you do)
Say you still love me

Shooter, shooter, yeah
You shot me in the heart, oh, yeah
And I've been dying since we'vе been apart
Oh-oh-oh, shooter, shooter
I don't think I'm gonna make it, no
And I'm just as good as dеad
(I'm good as dead)
Oooh-oooh-oooh

See, I neglected the fact that your love was precious
And I should have took more better care of it
And now every minute you're gone
Girl, I sit here just dying alone
And I wish that I could have dodged that bullet of you leaving me
