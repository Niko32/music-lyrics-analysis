I remember standing on the corner at midnight
Trying to get my courage up
There was this long lovely dancer in a little club downtown
Loved to watch her do her stuff
Through the long lonely nights she filled my sleep
Her body softly swaying to that smoky beat

[Refrain]
Down on Mainstreet
Down on Mainstreet

[Verse 2]
In the pool halls, the hustlers and the losers
Used to watch 'em through the glass
Well I'd stand outside at closing time
Just to watch her walk on past
Unlike all the other ladies, she looked so young and sweet
As she made her way alone down that empty street

[Refrain]
Down on Mainstreet
Down on Mainstreet (Ooh)

[Verse 3]
And sometimes even now, when I'm feeling lonely and beat
I drift back in time and I find my feet
You might also like[Refrain]
Down on Mainstreet
Down on Mainstreet
Down on Mainstreet
Down on Mainstreet
Down on Mainstreet
Down on Mainstreet
