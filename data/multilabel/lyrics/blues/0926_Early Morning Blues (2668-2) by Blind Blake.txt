Early this mornin', my baby made me sore
Early this mornin', my baby made me sore
"I'm going away to leave you, ain't comin' back no more"

[Verse 2]
Tell me, pretty mama, where did you stay last night?
Tell me, where did you stay last night?
Tell me, pretty mama, where did you stay last night?
"It ain't none of your business, daddy, since I treat you right"

[Verse 3]
When you see me sleepin', baby, don't you think I'm drunk
No, I'm not drunk, not a bit of it
When you see me sleepin', baby, don't you think I'm drunk
I got one eye on my pistol, and the other one on your trunk

[Instrumental Break]
Play that thing low and lonesome, Blake

[Verse 4]
I love you, pretty mama, believe me, it 'tain't no lie
I love you, pretty mama, believe me, and it 'tain't no lie
I mean it 'tain't no lie
The day you try to quit me, baby, that's the day you'll dieYou might also like
