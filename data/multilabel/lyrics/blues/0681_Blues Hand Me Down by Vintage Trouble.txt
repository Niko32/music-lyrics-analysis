Papa was a blues man, gave me the blues hand me down
An alligator shoes man, gave me the blues hand me downs
Moonshine drinking, doing everything but thinking
Blues hand me downs

Racing the wrong way, chasing every skirt in town
Taking the long way, waiting for the sun to come out
Wheeling, hustling, dealing and a-shuffling
Blues hand me downs

Lord, have mercy on my soul
I didn't know, you never know

A fighter, no lover, no fucking around
And just like my big brother, he stood on shaky ground
His pride got the best of him and smoking took the rest of him
Blues hand me downs

Lord, have mercy on my soul
I didn't know, you never know

Hand me down blues
Hand me down blues
Hand me down blues
Hey!

Hey!

I come from vintage trouble, look out if I'm the one you found
I'll pop your bubble with my live wire, straight shooting dirty mouth
Papa was a blues man, please, baby, understand
I got the, got the, got the blues hand me downs

Lord, have mercy on your soul
You didn't know, they never know

Hand me down blues
Hand me down blues
Hand me down blues
Hey, yeah

Hand me down blues
You're getting to me
Hand me down blues
I'm getting to you
Hand me down blues
Yeah, yeah
I got the, got the, got the, got the

Hey!
Papa was a blues man
Papa was a blues man, yes, sir
An alligator shoes man
Alright, alright
Give it to me
Give it to me
Give it to me
Hey!

Yes indeed, yes indeed, yes indeed, yes indeed, yes indeed
