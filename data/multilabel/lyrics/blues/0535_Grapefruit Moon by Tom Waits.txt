Grapefruit moon, one star shining, shining down on me
Heard that tune, now I'm pining, honey, can't you see?
'Cause every time I hear that melody, something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, can't turn back the tide

[Verse 2]
Never had no destinations, could not get across
You became my inspiration, oh, but what a cost
Every time I hear that melody, something breaks inside
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is more than I can hide

[Instrumental Verse]

[Verse 3]
Now I'm smoking cigarettes and I strive for purity
And I slip, just like the stars, into obscurity
And every time I hear that melody, puts me up a tree
And the grapefruit moon, one star shining, is all that I can seeYou might also like
