Since it costs a lot to win, and even more to lose
You and me bound to spend some time wond'rin' what to choose

[Chorus]
Goes to show, you don't ever know
Watch each card you play and play it slow
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, no, no

[Verse 2]
I been gamblin' hereabouts for ten good solid years
If I told you all that went down it would burn off both of your ears

[Chorus]
Goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play and play it slow
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down, no, no

[Verse 3]
Since you poured the wine for me and tightened up my shoes
I hate to leave you sittin' there, composin' lonesome blues

[Chorus]
Goes to show you don't ever know
Watch each card you play and play it slow
Wait until that deal come round
Don't you let that deal go down
You might also like[Outro]
Wait until that deal come round, don't you let that deal go down
Wait until that deal come round, don't you let that deal go down
Don't you let that deal go down, don't you let that deal go down
