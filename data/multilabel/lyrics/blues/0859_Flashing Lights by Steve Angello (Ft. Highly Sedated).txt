Yeah
We try to catch a moment
So you can catch a feeling
We live for that moment
We live for that feeling
One life, you better own it
Fight for what you believe in
Get up in the morning
Get down in the evening
We try to catch a moment
So you can catch a feeling
We live for that moment
We live for that feeling
One life, you better own it
Fight for what you believe in
Drive it like you stole it
Say it like you mean it
Come on

[Instrumental Drop]

[Chorus]
All I see, is flashing lights
Flashing lights around me
All I feel, is raindrops falling
Raindrops falling
Falling down on me
Falling down on me
Falling down on me
You might also likeAll I see, is flashing lights
Flashing lights around me
All I feel, is raindrops falling
Raindrops falling
Falling down on me
Falling down on me
