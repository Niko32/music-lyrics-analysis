Slipping, slipping, slipping away
I can tell you're not content and you don't want to tell me that
You're slipping, slipping, slipping away
Like a bud that never bloomed
And now can't stand the heat of June
Little light you've lost your glow, you just cry and no one knows
That love isn't your friend, your friends are gone
But I say, it's okay, it's okay

[Refrain]
Ditchin' this town 'fore I drown and there's one more open seat, trust in me
Take my hand, there's a big old world and I'll show you everything you wanna see, see, see
Anything you wanna see

[Verse 2]
Drifting, drifting, drifting away
You can tell I'm not content, but bitten nails prove some relent
I'm drifting, drifting, drifting away
Like a tide under the moon, low and silently at tune
I thought that I would find your glow
I just cry because I know
That love is your friend, and that friend is me
But you never noticed a friend

[Refrain]
Ditchin' this town 'fore I drown and there's one more open seat, trust in me
Take my hand, there's a big old world  and I'll show you everything you wanna see, see, see
Anything you wanna see
Anything you wanna see
You might also like[Verse 3]
Blue bird locked up inside of me, I can't let you be free
So for now I'll keep you tucked away with memories of willow trees
Hopelessly defenseless, love has left us breathless
Tell me you're a liar, we will never win this
I chased away your demons, you're always in the deep end
There's a black hole in my heart and it won't stop

[Outro]
So I'm slipping, I'm slipping, I'm slipping away
