Mama in the kitchen cookin'
And the children upstairs asleep
It's time for old Santa Claus
To make his midnight creep 'cause
Santa Claus wants some lovin', hey, now
Santa Claus wants some lovin'

I know there's somethin' real pretty
Under that Christmas tree
I ain't had no lovin'
And it's worryin' me cause
Santa Claus wants some lovin', do you hear me?
Santa Claus wants some lovin'

[Verse 3]
I'm tryna fix this old bicycle
I can't seem to find my pliers
I'm halfway watchin' Mama
Before she catch that sleep in her eyes, 'cause
Santa Claus wants some lovin', buddy
Santa Claus wants some lovin'

[Verse 4]
I don't want no turkey
I don't care nothin' 'bout no cake
I want you to come in here, woman
Before them children wake 'cause
