Put on your red dress, baby
Lord, we goin' out tonight
Put on your red dress, baby
Lord, we goin' out tonight
And wear some boxin' gloves
In case some fool might wanna fight

[Verse 2]
Put on your hi-heel sneakers
Wear your wig hat on your head
Put on your hi-heel sneakers
Wear your wig hat on your head
And I'm pretty sure now, baby
Don't you know you know you gonna knock 'em dead

Hey-ah
[Instrumental Verse]
Go ahead

[Verse 3]
I got my Old Crow liquor
And my paycheck in my hand
I got my Old Crow liquor
I got my paycheck in my hand
Big John's bootleg whiskey
Cost much more than I can stand

Hey-ya-hey
[Guitar Solo]
Oh, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 4]
Put on your hi-heel sneakers
Wear your wig hat on your head
Put on your hi-heel sneakers
Wear your wig hat on your head
Know you're gonna be your [?]
I'm pretty sure you're gonna knock 'em dead
