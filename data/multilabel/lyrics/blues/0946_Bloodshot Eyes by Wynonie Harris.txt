Now just because you're pretty
And you think you're mighty wise
You tell me that you love me
Then you roll those big brown eyes
When I saw you last week
Your eyes were turning black
Go find the guy that beats you up
Ask him to take you back

[Chorus]
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can tell you've been out on a spree
It's plain that you're lyin'
When you say that you've been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me

[Verse 2]
Now I used to spend my money
To make you look real sweet
I wanted to be proud of you
When we walked down the street
Now don't ask me to dress you up
In satin and in silk
Your eyes look like two cherries
In a glass of buttermilk
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can tell that you've been out on a spree
It's plain that you're lyin'
When you say that you've been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me

[Verse 3]
Now I guess our little romance
Has finally simmered down
You should join a circus
You'd make a real good clown
Your eyes look like a roadmap
I'm scared to smell your breath
You'd better shut your peepers
Before you bleed to death

[Chorus]
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
I can tell you've been out on a spree
It's plain that you're lyin'
When you say that you've been cryin'
Don't roll those bloodshot eyes at me
