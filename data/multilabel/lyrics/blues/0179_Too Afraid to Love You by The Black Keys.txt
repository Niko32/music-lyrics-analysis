My gears they grind more each day
And I feel like they're gonna grind away
Oh
And the city blocks, they drive me wild
They're never ending, mile after mile

[Chorus]
I just don't know what to do
I'm too afraid to love you

[Verse 2]
It's heaven on Earth, it's in her embrace
Her gentle touch and her smilin' face
I am just one wishing that I was a pair
With someone, oh, somewhere

[Chorus]
I just don't know what to do
I'm too afraid to love you

[Bridge]
All those sleepless nights and all those wasted days
I wish loneliness would leave me, but I think it's here to stay
What more can I do? 'Cause I'm wringin' myself dry
And I can't afford to lose one more teardrop from my eye, woah
You might also like[Outro]
I'm too afraid, I'm too afraid
I just don't know what to do with myself
Thinkin' all about you
Don't know what to do
Don't know what to do
Drivin' me outta my mind
