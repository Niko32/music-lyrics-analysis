My girl, my girl, don't lie to me
Tell me, where did you sleep last night?
(Come on and tell me baby)
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 2]
My girl, my girl, where will you go?
I'm going where the cold wind blows
(Whereâ€™s that, baby?)
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through

[Verse 3]
My girl, my girl, don't you lie to me
Tell me, where did you sleep last night?
(Come on and tell me something about it)
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
(Shiver for me now)

[Verse 4]
Her husband, was a hard working man
Killed a mile and half from here (what happened to him?)
His head was found in a driving wheel
And his body has never been found

My girl, my girl, don't you lie to me
Tell me where did you sleep last night
In the pines, in the pines where the sun don't ever shine
I would shiver the whole night through
