Baby boy
Your face is pretty and your life's a toy
Master man
I'm never better than your latest plan

[Pre-Chorus]
Poor donee
What are you gonna try to be?
Where are you gonna go without me now?

[Chorus]
I've been your mother, I've been your father
Who can ask me for more?
I've been your sister, I've been your mistress
Maybe I was your whore
Who can ask me for more?

[Verse 2]
Superstar
I've tried to educate your childish heart
I made your bed
And I was in it when your faith was dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Poor donee
What are you gonna try to be?
Where are you gonna go without me now?
You might also like[Chorus]
I've been your mother, I've been your father
Who can ask me for more?
I've been your sister, I've been your mistress
Maybe I was your whore
Who can ask me for more?

[Verse 3]
Sweetie pie
I'm your personal pro, you know
You know what number to try when to cry

[Chorus]
I've been your mother, I've been your father
Who can ask me for more?
I've been your sister, I've been your mistress
Maybe I was your whore
I've been your mother, I've been your father
Who can ask me for more?
I've been your sister, I've been your mistress
Maybe I was your whore
Who can ask me for more?
You can't ask me for more

Ahh-oh, ahh-oh
Ahh-oh, ahh-oh
