When you wake in the mornin' and I can tell it's not your best side
No "Good morning, good day"
I stay to the right if I know you're mad and on the left side
Stay outta your way

[Pre-Chorus]
Just hold on
In a minute, it'll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

[Chorus]
I know, I know
That you go through a lot
I know, I know
The pressure makes you hot
See, I know, I know
'Cause you still know what you got
I know, I know, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I'm rooting for my baby, yeah

[Verse 2]
Oh, if you were here, I'd get your beer and I would hang your coat
You wanna be home
So you roll up your sleeves and you sweat and breathe, this is a long road
So much more to go
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Just hold on
In a minute, it'll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone

[Chorus]
I know, I know
That you go through a lot
I know, I know
That the pressure makes you hot
See, I know, I know
'Cause you still know what you got
I know, I know, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I'm rooting for my baby, yeah

[Bridge]
See, I've been dream-catching
I thought that this is everlasting
A life filled with you, me, love and laughter
Happily ever after

[Pre-Chorus]
So hold on
In a minute, it'll be over and gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone
[Chorus]
I know, I know
That you go through a lot
I know, I know
That the pressure makes you hot
See, I know, I know
'Cause you still know what you got
I know, I know, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
I'm rooting for my baby, yeah
I'm rooting for you, baby, yeah
I'm rooting for my baby, yeah

[Outro]
That you go through a lot
The pressure makes you hot
You still know what you got, yeah
