Up with the sun, gone with the wind
She always said I was lazy
Leavin' my home, leavin' my friends
Runnin' when things get too crazy
Out to the road, out 'neath the stars
Feelin' the breeze, passin' the cars

[Verse 2]
Women have come, women have gone
Everyone tryin' to cage me
Some were so sweet, I barely got free
Others, they only enraged me

[Chorus]
Sometimes at night I see their faces
I feel the traces they've left on my soul
Those are the memories that make me a wealthy soul
Those are the memories that make me a wealthy soul

[Verse 3]
Travelin' man, love when I can
Turn loose my hand 'cause I'm goin'
Travelin' man, catch if you can
But sooner than later I'm goin'
Travelin' man, yeah
Hey, travelin' man, yes I am
You might also like[Chorus]
Sometimes at night I see their faces
I feel the traces they've left on my soul
Those are the memories that make me a wealthy soul
Those are the memories that make me a wealthy soul
