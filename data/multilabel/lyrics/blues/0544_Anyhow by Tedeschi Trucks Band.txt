Running from a bitter taste
Took a rest from all the chase
Feeling something anchored on my soul
Played the game by all the rules
Learning lessons no one gets to choose

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Everywhere I turn, here I am
So walk away with me, walk away
I'll show you that

[Chorus]
I would go anywhere, anytime
(Anywhere, anytime)
I would do anything, anyway
(Anyway)
Anyhow

[Verse 2]
Woke up feeling all adrift
Pieced together what I missed
Realized that you pushed me out to sea
Followed from a lost place
Dealing with the wreckage in my soul
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Everywhere I turn, there you are, you are
So walk away with me, walk away
I'll show you that

[Chorus]
I would go anywhere, anytime
(Anywhere, anytime)
I would do anything, anyway
(Anyway)
Anyhow, oh anyhow

[Verse 3]
No one cares to loan a dime
Sorry if it cost you time
What'd you expect a desperate man to do?
Cain and Abel lit the flame
We can never go that way again

[Pre-Chorus 3]
Everywhere I turn, here we are, we are
So walk away with me, walk away
I'll show you that

[Chorus]
I would go anywhere, anytime
(Anywhere, anytime)
I would do anything, anyway
(Anyway)
I would go anywhere, anytime
(Anywhere, anytime)
I would do anything, anyway
Anyhow
[Outro]
Oh I would go
Oh anywhere
I would do
Almost anything
Anyway
I would do
Most anything
Oh, anyway
Anyhow
Anytime
Anytime
Anytime
Anytime
Anytime
Anytime
