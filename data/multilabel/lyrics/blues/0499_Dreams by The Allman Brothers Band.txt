Just one more mornin'
I had to wake up with the blues
Pulled myself outta bed, yeah
Put on my walkin' shoes
Went up on the mountain
To see what I could see
The whole world was fallin'
Right down in front of me

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hung up on dreams I'll never see, yeah baby
Ah help me baby, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah

[Guitar Solo: Duane Allman]

[Verse 2]
Pull myself together, put on a new face
Climb down off the hilltop, baby
Get back in the race

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm hung up on dreams I'll never see, yeah baby, yeah
Ah help me baby, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah

[Verse 2]
Pull myself together, put on a new face
Climb down off the hilltop, baby
Get back in the race

'Cause I'm hung up on dreams I'll never see, yeah baby, oh
Ah help me baby, or this will surely be the end of me, yeah
