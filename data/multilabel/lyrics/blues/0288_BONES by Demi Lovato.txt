The second you walked in the room my legs started to shake
Blood racing, heart pounding like there's a fucking earthquake
One look at me and I lost myself in those blue eyes
And I couldn't close mine no matter how hard that I tried

[Pre-Chorus]
So many feelings
When you said her name
'Cause I want you so bad
That I need restraints

[Chorus]
Let me jump your bones
Start to lose control
Taking off your clothes
No one has to know
Let me, let me, let me
Let me jump your bones
(Bones)

[Verse 2]
Selfishly speaking, I want all of you to myself
And one day I'm gonna leave you needing nobody else

[Pre-Chorus]
So many feelings
When you said my name
'Cause I want you so bad
That I need restraints
You might also like[Chorus]
Let me jump your bones
Start to lose control
Taking off your clothes
No one has to know (No one has to know)
Let me, let me, let me
Let me jump your bones (Bones, yeah)
Let me, let me, let me
Let me jump your bones
(Let me jump your bones, yeah)
Let me, let me, let me
Let me jump your

[Outro]
Bones
