Now don't you worry none
Leave this part of yourself behind
I'm giving you back to yourself

[Chorus]
So should you make the change? (Make the change)
Or could you right them wrongs? (Right them wrongs)
For I cannot replace where I'm going
Where I'm going, love

[Verse 2]
So you're angry with me (Angry with me)
What could be better, my love?
Have most of everything for yourself
Hateful and reserved (Hateful and reserved)
Charlie Manson's eyes
Are looking through you back to myself

[Chorus]
So should I act my age? (Act my age)
Or should I just not belong? (Not belong)
For I cannot replace where I'm going
Where I'm going, love
Where I'm going
Where I'm going, loveYou might also like
