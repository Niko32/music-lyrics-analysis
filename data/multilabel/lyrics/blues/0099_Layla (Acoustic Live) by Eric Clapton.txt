See if you can spot this one

[Verse 1]
What will you do when you get lonely
No one waiting by your side?
You've been running, hiding much too long
You know it's just your foolish pride

[Chorus]
Layla, got me on my knees
Layla, begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

[Verse 2]
Tried to give you consolation
Your old man had let you down
Like a fool, I fell in love with you
You turned my whole world upside down

[Chorus]
Layla, got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

[Verse 3]
Make the best of the situation
Before I finally go insane
Please donâ€™t say we'll never find a way
Tell me all my love's in vain

Layla, got me on my knees
Layla, I'm begging, darling, please Layla

(Yeah, yeeeeah)

[Chorus]
Layla, got me on my knees
Layla, begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?

(Yeah, yeeeeah)

[Guitar solo]

[Chorus]
Layla, got me on my knees

[Chorus]
Layla, got me on my knees
Layla, begging, darling, please Layla
Darling, won't you ease my worried mind?
