Going back to Pensicola
Gonna buy my babe a money [molar?]

Say, babe, did you get that letter
Will you take me back, I'll treat you better
Nobody's business but mine
Ain't nobody's doggone business how my baby treat me
Nobody's business but my own

Ain't nobody's dirty business how my baby treatin' me
Nobody's business but my own
