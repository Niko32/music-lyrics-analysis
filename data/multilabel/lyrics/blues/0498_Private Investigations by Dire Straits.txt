[Verse 1]
It's a mystery to me, the game commences
For the usual fee, plus expenses
Confidential information, it's in a diary
This is my investigation, it's not a public inquiry
[Verse 2]
I go checking out the reports, digging up the dirt
You get to meet all sorts in this line of work
Treachery and treason, there's always an excuse for it
And when I find the reason, I still can't get used to it

[Verse 3]
And what have you got at the end of the day?
What have you got to take away?
A bottle of whisky and a new set of lies
Blinds on the windows, and a pain behind the eyes
[Instrumental break 2:55-3:35]
[Bridge]
Scarred for life, no compensation
Private investigations
