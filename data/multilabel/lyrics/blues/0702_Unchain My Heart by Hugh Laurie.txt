Baby let me be
Unchain my heart
'Cause you don't care about me
You've got me sowed up like a pillow case
But you let my love go to waste
So unchain my heart
Set me free

Unchain my heart
Baby let me go
Unchain my heart
'Cause you don't love me no more
Every time I call you on the phone
Some fella tells me that you're not at home
So unchain my heart
Set me free

You got me under your spell
Like a man in a trance
But i know darn well
That I don't stand a chance

Unchain my heart
Let me go my way
Unchain my heart
You worry me night and day
Why let me lead a life of misery
When you don't care a bag of beans for me
So unchain my heart
And set me free
You might also likeUnchain my heart
Let me go my way
Unchain my heart
You worry me night and day
Why let me lead a life of misery
When you don't care a bag of beans for me
So unchain my heart
And set me free
Unchain my heart
And set me free
