If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
If being right means being without you, I'd rather live a wrong doing life
Your mama and daddy said, ''It's a shame, it's a downright disgrace''
But long as I got you by my side, I don't care what your people say

[Pre-Chorus]
Your friends said, "It's no future in loving a married man''
If I can't see you when I wanna, I'll see you when I can, oh

[Chorus]
If loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
I said if loving you is wrong, I don't ever be right, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Am I wrong to fall to fall in love, so deeply in love with you
Knowing I got a wife and two little children depending on me too?
And am I wrong to hunger for the gentleness of your touch
Knowing I got someone else at home could use me just as much?

[Pre-Chorus]
And are you wrong to give your love to a married man?
And am I wrong for trying to hold on to the best thing I've ever had?

[Chorus]
Oh, if loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
Oh, if loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right, yeah, yeah

And are you wrong to give your love to a married man?
And am I wrong for trying to hold on to the best thing I've ever had?

[Chorus]
Oh, if loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right
Oh, if loving you is wrong, I don't wanna be right, yeah, yeah
