To see her son Louis leave his home
Angels laid him away

Angels laid him away
They laid him six feet under the clay
Angels laid him away

Cryin', friends, oh ain't it hard
To see poor Louis in a new graveyard
Angels laid him away

Bob shot once, and Louis shot two
They shot poor Collins, shot him through and through
Angels laid him away

Angels laid him away
They laid him six feet under the clay
Angels laid him away

Ms. Collins weeped, Mrs. Collins moaned
To see her son Louis leave his home
Angels laid him away

Angels laid him away
They laid him six feet under the clay
Angels laid him away
You might also likeWhen they heard that Louis was dead
All the people they dressed in red
Angels laid him away

Angels laid him away
They laid him six feet under the clay
Angels laid him away
