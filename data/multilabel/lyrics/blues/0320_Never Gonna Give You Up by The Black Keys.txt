Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'

[Verse 1]
Girl, you treat me bad and I know why
I've seen you runnin' around with another guy
And you think if you hurt me, then I'll go away
But, I've made up my mind, you know I'm, I'm here to stay

[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, don't you understand what you're doing to the man?

[Verse 2]
Do you see these tears, they're in my eyes
There's no use in lyin', 'cause I really cried
You think you gonna take me and put me on the shelf
I'd rather die than see you with somebody else
You might also like[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, don't you understand what you're doing to the man?

[Verse 3]
Well, my friends all say that I'm your fool
And you're using me like a carpenter uses a tool
I know their intentions, they're all very good
Some of them would help me if they could

[Chorus]
But I'm never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'

[Post-Chorus]
Baby, don't you understand what you're doing to the man?

[Chorus]
Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'
Never gonna give you up
No matter how you treat me
Never gonna give you up
So don't you think of leavin'
