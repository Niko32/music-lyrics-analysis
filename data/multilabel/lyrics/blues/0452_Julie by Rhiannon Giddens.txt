Won't you run?
'Cause I see down yonder, the soldiers have come
Julie, oh Julie
Can't you see?
Them devils have come to take you far from me

Mistress, oh mistress
I won't run
'Cause I see down yonder, the soldiers have come
Mistress, oh mistress
I do see
And I'll stay right here 'til they come for me

Julie, oh Julie
You won't go
Leave this house and all you know
Julie, oh Julie
Don't leave here
Leave us, who love you, and all you hold dear

Mistress, oh mistress
I will go
Leave this house and all I know
Mistress, oh mistress
I will leave here
With what family I've got left, they're all I hold dear
You might also likeJulie, oh Julie
Won't you lie?
If they find that trunk of gold by my side
Julie, oh Julie
You tell them men
That that trunk of gold is yours, my friend

Mistress, oh mistress
I won't lie
If they find that trunk of gold by your side
Mistress, oh mistress
That trunk of gold
Is what you got when my children you sold

Mistress, oh mistress
Don't you cry
The price of stayin' here is too high
Mistress, oh mistress
I wish you well
But in leavin' here, I'm leavin' hell
