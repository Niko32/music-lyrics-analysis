I'm so unhappy, I feel so blue
I always feel so sad
I made a mistake right from the start
Oh, it seems so hard to part
Oh, but this letter that I will write
I hope he will remember when he receives it

[Verse 2]
See see rider, see what you done done, Lord, Lord, Lord
You made me love you, now your gal done come
You made me love you, now your gal done come

[Verse 3]
I'm goin' away, baby, won't be back 'til fall, Lord, Lord, Lord
Goin' away, baby, won't be back 'til fall
If I find me a good man, I won't be back at all

[Verse 4]
I'm gonna buy me a pistol just as long as I am tall, Lord, Lord, Lord
Gonna kill my man and catch the Cannonball
If he don't have me, he won't have no gal at allYou might also like
