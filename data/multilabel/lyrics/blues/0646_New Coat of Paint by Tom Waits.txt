Let's put a new coat of paint on this lonesome old town
Set 'em up, we'll be knockin' em down
You wear a dress, baby, I'll wear a tie
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon in that burgundy sky

Here amidst the shuffle of an overflowing day
Our love needs a transfusion, let's shoot it full of wine
Fishin' for a good time starts with throwin' in your line

[Instrumental Verse]

[Verse 1]
So let's put a new coat of paint on this lonesome old town
Set 'em up, set 'em up, we'll be knockin' em down
You wear a dress, baby, I'll wear a tie
We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon in that burgundy skyYou might also like
