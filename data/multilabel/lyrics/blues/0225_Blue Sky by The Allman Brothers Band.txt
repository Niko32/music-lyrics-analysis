Walk along the river, sweet lullaby
They just keep on flowin', they don't worry 'bout where it's goin', no, no

[Verse 2]
Don't fly, mister blue bird, I'm just walkin' down the road
Early morning sunshine, tell me all I need to know, oh

[Chorus]
You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day
Lord, you know it makes me high
When you turn your love my way
Turn your love my way, yeah

[Guitar Solos: Duane Allman & Dickey Betts]

[Verse 3]
Good old Sunday mornin', bells are ringin' everywhere
Goin' to Carolina, it won't be long and I'll be there

[Chorus]
You're my blue sky, you're my sunny day
Lord, you know it makes me high
When you turn your love my way
You turn your love my way, yeah, yeahYou might also like
