And I don't know where you went when you left me but
Says here in the water you must be gone by now
I can tell somehow
One hand on the trigger of a telephone
Wondering when the call comes
When you say it's alright
You got your heart right

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on your porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
We share the sadness
Split screen sadness

[Chorus]
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight
Two wrongs make it all alright tonight

[Verse 2]
All you need is love is a lie 'cause
We had love but we still said goodbye
Now we're tired, battered fighters
And it stings when it's nobody's fault
'Cause there's nothing to blame at the drop of your name
It's only the air you took and the breath you left
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So maybe I'll sleep inside my coat and
Wait on your porch 'til you come back home
Oh, right
I can't find a flight
So I check the weather wherever you are
'Cause I want to know if you can see the stars tonight
It might be my only right

[Chorus]
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)

[Bridge]
I called
Because
I just
Need to feel you on the line
Don't hang up this time
And I know it was me who called it over but
I still wish you'd fought me 'til your dying day
Don't let me get away
[Outro]
'Cause I can't wait to figure out what's wrong with me
So I can say this is the way that I used to be
There's no substitute for time
Or for the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
We share the sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Split screen sadness
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
Oh, and the sadness, it's so right, it's so right
(Two wrongs make it all alright, tonight)
