There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time

Life is bare
Gloom and misery everywhere
Stormy weather
Just can't get my poor self together
I'm weary all the time, the time
So weary all of the time

When he went away
The blues walked in and met me
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me
All I do is pray the Lord above will let me
Walk in the sun once more

Can't go on
All I have in life is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time
You might also likeI walk around
Heavy-hearted and sad
Night comes around
And I'm still feeling bad
Rain pourin' down
Blinding every hope I had
This pitterin', patterin', beatin' and spatterin'
Drives me mad

Love, love, love, love
This misery is just too much for me

Can't go on
All I have in life is gone
Stormy weather
Since my man and I ain't together
Keeps raining all the time
Keeps raining all the time
