If you're down and out, and you hurt real good
Come on over to the place I work
And all your loneliness, I'll try to soothe
I'll play the blues for you

[Verse 2]
Don't be afraid, come on in
You might run across some of your old friends
And all your loneliness, I'll try to soothe
I'll play the blues for you

[Verse 3]
Ain't no big name, ain't no big star
I'll play the blues for you on my guitar
All your loneliness, I'll try soothe
I'll play the blues for you (play the blues)You might also like
