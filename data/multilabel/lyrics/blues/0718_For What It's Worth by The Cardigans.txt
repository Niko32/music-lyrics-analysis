Hey baby come around
Keep holding me down
And I'll be keeping you up tonight
A four letter word got stuck in my head
The dirtiest word that I've ever said
It's making me feel alright

[Chorus]
For what it's worth I love you
And what is worse I really do
For what it's worth I'm going to run, run, run
Till the sweetness gets to you
And what is worse I love you

[Verse 2]
Hey please baby come back
There'll be no more loving attacks
And I'll be keeping it cool tonight
The four letter word is out of my head
Come on around get back in my bed
Keep making me feel alright

[Chorus]
For what it's worth I like you
And what is worse I really do
Things have been worse and we had fun fun fun
Till I said I love you
And what is worse I really do
You might also like[Bridge]
For what it's worth I love you
And what is worse I really do, ahhhh...

[Outro]
For what it's worth I love you
And what is worse I really do ahhhh...
For what it's worth I love you
And what is worse I really do ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh...
