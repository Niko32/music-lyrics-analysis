Down in the forest, near a village
Lived the man called "Nick the Chopper"
Chopping woods his game and making money
Caring not for trees, he blindly chops on

Never to be married, he never washes
He never went to school, Nick the Chopper
Chopping woods his game and getting money
Doesn't care for life or even for a friend now

[Hook]
He is a dirty old man, Nick the Chopper
He is a dirty old man, Nick the Chopper
We're gonna kill you, Nick the Chopper
Strangle you with branches, Nick the Chopper

[After-Hook]
He is a dirty old man, Nick the Chopper
He is a dirty old man, Nick the Chopper

[Part 2]
Now, a very old man, he had decided
To make his fortune, Nick the Chopper
Chopping woods his game, he couldn't stop it
He wants to cut down, all the forest
You might also likeThe trees they hated him, they made a promise
Give him a lesson, Nick the Chopper
Chopping woods his game, he couldn't stop it
But as the story goes, he's beaten at his game

[Hook]
He is a dirty old man, Nick the Chopper
He is a dirty old man, Nick the Chopper
We're gonna kill you, Nick the Chopper
Strangle you with branches, Nick the Chopper

[Outro]
Deli gönül uçtu, haydin evelallah
Helalim ol kız, gel evelallah

Rüyamda dün gece seni gördüm
Dağlara taşlara seni sordum
Hayırdır dedim, hayra yordum
Gördüm, sordum, yordum evelallah
Haberimi uçurun nazlı yare
Yüreğim vuruyor pare pare
Lokman hekim gelse bulamaz çare
Yare, pare, çare evelallah

Deli gönül uçtu, haydin evelallah
Helalim ol kız, gel evelallah
Deli gönül uçtu, haydin evelallah
Helalim ol kız, gel evelallah
Deli gönül uçtu, haydin evelallah
Helalim ol kız, gel evelallah
