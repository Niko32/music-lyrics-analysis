My mother died and left me reckless
My daddy died and left me wild, wild, wild
Mother died and left me reckless
Daddy died and left me wild, wild, wild
No, I'm not good lookin' but I'm some sweet woman's angel child

[Verse 3]
She's a mighty mean woman, do me this a-way
She's a mighty mean woman, do me this a-way
When I leave this town, pretty mama, I'm goin' away to stay

I once loved a woman, better than any I'd ever seen
Treated me like I was a king and she was a doggone queen

Sister, tell your brother, brother tell your auntie

Now cousin, tell my friend
Goin' up the country, mama, don't you want to go?

Mama, Sister got 'em, Auntie got 'em
Brother got 'em, friends got 'em, I got 'em
Woke up this morning, we had them Statesboro blues
I looked over in the corner, Grandma and Grandpa had 'em too
