Do-doo-do-do, do-doo-do-do
Do-doo-do-do, do-doo-do-do

[Verse 1]
People, don't you worry 'bout me
Evil gon' get buried by me
Well, I'm gonna shoot you out of this lil' town and
Soon as I do it, I'ma get down
Come on
Ah, ah, ah, come on

[Chorus]
Do-doo-do-do, do-doo-do-do
Do-doo-do-do, do-doo-do-do

[Verse 2]
Mama, don't you worry 'bout me
Papa, don't you worry 'bout me
Well, I live a life but it just ain't mine
I know I'm your son, won't you let me shine?
Come on
Ah, ah, ah, come on

[Chorus]
Do-doo-do-do, do-doo-do-do
Do-doo-do-do, do-doo-do-do

Sally, don't you worry 'bout me
Sally, don't you worry 'bout me
Don't worry 'bout me, I'll be fine
Well, that's what I tell 'em, baby, but I'm lyin'
Come on, all people, come on

[Interlude]
Y'all know 'bout the blues, don't you?
Everybody get the blues
Even babies get the blues

[Bridge]
Some call it baby blue
Some call it midnight blue
Some call it navy blue
Whatever hue is what we gonna do
We gon' play until you feel happy
'Til there ain't no more blues

[Chorus]
Do-doo-do-do, do-doo-do-do
Do-doo-do-do, do-doo-do-do

[Outro]
Idlewild
Be there
