I ain't got no money, baby
Give me some money
Don't want your honey
I can make my own
Well now, you keep your sugar
Well I, I'm plenty sweet
Oh, give me some money
Or just leave me alone

[Verse 1]
I've been taken in pieces, I've been sold off cheap
I've been spread out all over the Southeast
Well now, in my travels I have found some parts of it
I'm still looking for my heart
Now I'm running low on gasoline
Well now, come on honey, give me what I need

[Chorus]
I ain't got no money, baby
Give me some money
I don't want your honey
I can make my own
Well now, you keep your sugar
Well I, I'm plenty sweet, Lord
Give me some money
Or just leave me alone
You might also like[Verse 2]
Oh I, I've been mistreated
I ain't got no love, Lord, left to give
I'm all used up
I ain't playing, you know what I need
Well come on, baby, don't be cheap

[Chorus]
Give me some money
I ain't got no money
I don't want your honey
I can make my own
Well, you're sugar sweet
Button, I'm plenty sweet
Give me some money
Or just leave me alone

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Well, I ain't got nothing but what you see
Darling, I'm only interested in one damn thing
So give it up, honey, I don't want everything
I just need enough to get to New Orleans

[Chorus]
Aw well, give me some money, baby
Ain't got no money
I don't want your honey
I can make my own
Well now, you're sugar sweet
But I, I'm plenty sweet, Lord
Give me some money
Or just leave me alone
[Outro]
I said, give me some money
Give me some money
Give me some money
Give me some money
