I'm goin' to Louisiana and get me a mojo hand
I'm goin' to Louisiana and get me a mojo hand
I'm gonna fix my woman so
She can't have no other man

[Verse 2]
Cold ground was my bed last night
Rocks were my pillow too
Cold ground was my bed last night
Rocks were my pillow too
I woke up this morning, I was wondering
What am I gonna do?

[Verse 3]
I lay down thinking
Buy me a mojo hand
I lay down thinking
Buy me a mojo hand
I did wanna fix my woman so
She can't have no other man

[Verse 4]
But don't let your woman
Fix you like mine fixed me
Don't let your woman, boy
Fix you like mine fixed me
She make a fool about her
Uh, 'bout as a fool can be

Now, can't a woman act funny, heh-heh-heh-heh
When she got another man?
Can't a woman act funny
When she got another man?
You know, she won't look straight at you
That she's always raisin' sin, sin

[Verse 6]
Well, I'm goin' tomorrow
But I won't be gone long
I'm goin' tomorrow
But I won't be gone very long
I'm gonna get me a mojo hand
I'm gonna bring it back home

[Outro]
That's what I'm gon' do
