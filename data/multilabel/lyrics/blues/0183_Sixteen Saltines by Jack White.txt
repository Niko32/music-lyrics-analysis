Woo

[Verse 1]
She's got stickers on her locker
And the boy's number's there in magic marker
I'm hungry and the hunger will linger
I eat sixteen saltine crackers, then I lick my fingers
Well, every morning, I deliver the news
Black hat, white shoes and I'm red all over
She's got a pink mailbox that she puts out front
Garbage in, garbage out; she's gettin' what she wants

[Chorus]
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
If I get busy, then I couldn't care less what you do
But when I'm by myself, I think of nothing else
Than if a boy just might be gettin' through and touchin' you

[Verse 2]
Spike heels make a hole in a lifeboat
Driftin' away when I'm talkin' and laughin' as we float
I hear her whistle, that's how I know she's home
Lipstick, eyelash, broke mirror, broken home
Force-fed, forced meds 'til I drop dead
You can't defeat her, when you meet her, you'll get what I said
The Lord knows there's a method to her madness
But the Lord's joke is a boat in a sea of sadness
You might also like[Chorus]
She doesn't know, but when she's gone, I sit and drink her perfume
And I'm sure she's drinkin' too, but why, where, and what for, and who?
And I'm solo rowin' on one side of the boat
Lookin' up, throwin' up, a lifesaver down my throat

[Outro]
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
Who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous, who's jealous of who?
