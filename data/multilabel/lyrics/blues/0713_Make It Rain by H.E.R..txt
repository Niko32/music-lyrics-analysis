When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, and just the same

[Chorus]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain

[Verse 2]
Well, a seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground (Yeah)
It just keeps on getting harder (Keeps getting harder)
Hunger more profound (Hunger more profound)
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eyes
But they may as well, may as well be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, and just the same
You might also like[Chorus]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain

(Instrumental Bridge)

[Chorus]
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain
