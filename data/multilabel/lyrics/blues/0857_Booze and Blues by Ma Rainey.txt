Went to bed last night, and folks, I was in my dream
I went to bed last night and I was in my dream
Woke up this mornin', the police were shakin' me

[Verse 2]
I went to the jailhouse, drunk and blue as I could be
I went to the jailhouse, drunk and blue as I could be
But this cruel old judge sent my man away from me

[Verse 3]
They carried me to the courthouse, Lordy, how I was cryin'
They carried me to the courthouse, Lordy, how I was cryin'
They gave me sixty days in jail, and money couldn't pay my fine

[Verse 4]
Sixty days ain't long when you can spend them as you choose
Sixty days ain't long when you can spend them as you choose
But they seem like years in a cell where there ain't no booze

[Verse 5]
My life is all a misery when I cannot get my booze
My life is all a misery when I cannot get my booze
I can't live without my liquor, gotta have the booze to cure these bluesYou might also like
