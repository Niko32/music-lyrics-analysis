[Verse 1]
I've been finding good time
To be bored out of my mind
I've been walking for days
I don't have the time to play
You're kind of parley

[Pre-Chorus]
So won't you come home soon
Won't you come home soon

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
I never wish for you to go
To rove down that old road
You're making my heart low
Lost in that old world
The only one I'll ever fall

[Pre-Chorus]
So won't you come home soon
Won't you come home soon
