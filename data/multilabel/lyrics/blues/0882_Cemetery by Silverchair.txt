Need a change
Not to imitate
But to irritate
All the ones who hate
I may be late
Always seem to get the wrong date
Well, I guess it's fate

[Verse 2]
I live in a cemetery
Full of good will and integrity
You see, I have no specialty
Here's your warning
I'll give you click click boom

[Chorus]
I live in a cemetery
I need a change
Not to imitate
But to irritate
I live in a cemetery
I need a change
Not to imitate
But to irritate
You might also like[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I live in a cemetery
I need a change
Not to imitate
But to irritate
I live in a cemetery
I need a change
Not to imitate
But to irritate
I live in a cemetery
I need a change
Not to imitate
But to irritate

[Outro]
I live in a cemetery
