I'm walkin', yes, indeed
And I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me, yeah
I'm lonely as I can be
I'm waitin' for your company
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me

[Bridge]
What you gonna do when the well runs dry?
You're gonna run away and hide
I'm gonna run right by your side
For you, pretty baby, I'll even die

[Chorus]
I'm walkin', yes, indeed
And I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I'm walkin', yes, indeed
And I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me, yeah
I'm lonely as I can be
I'm waitin' for your company
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me

What you gonna do when the well runs dry?
You're gonna sit right down and cry
What you gonna do when I say bye-bye?
All you're gonna do is dry your eye

[Chorus]
I'm walkin', yes, indeed
And I'm talkin' 'bout you and me
I'm hopin' that you'll come back to me
