Kiss me again, rekiss me and kiss me
Slip your frigid hands beneath my shirt
This useless old fucker with his twinkling cunt
Doesn't care if he gets hurt

[Chorus]
Green eyes, oh, green eyes
Green eyes, green eyes

[Verse 2]
If it were but a matter of faith
If it were measured in petitions and prayer
She would materialize, all fleshed out
But it is not, nor do I care, nor do I care

[Chorus]
Green eyes, oh, green eyes
Green eyes, green eyes

[Verse 3]
So hold me and hold me, don't tell me your name
This morning will be wiser than this evening is
Then leave me to my enemied dreams
And be quiet as you are leaving, miss
You might also like[Chorus]
Green eyes
Green eyes, green eyes
Green eyes, oh, green eyes
