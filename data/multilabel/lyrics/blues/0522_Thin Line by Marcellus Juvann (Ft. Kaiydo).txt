I was born in a small city, lakeside
Dream bigger than a motherfucking state line
Momma told me how to build it from the ground up
And the job is never done until the paint dry
Drug dealers ain't believe I have an iPhone
Cause ain't nobody ever ever trynna Facetime
Pig trynna kill a nigga for his skin color
That's why I gotta keep that thing on my waistline
It's the world we envision
God, it's the world you envision
I been talking to myself
But I knew that you could hear me
Send me a sign if you can hear me
I just need a little help
I just need the world to feel me
Put the weed into the philly
Man I got a lot of stress
Don't leave my house without a vest
I think my nation trynna kill me
Man I don't think y'all niggas hear me
I don't think y'all niggas feel me

Don't feel don't feel my pain
Nigga only 22 and some change
Nigga haven't reached my prime yet
Still got time
Been a year
A whole lot of shit changed
Niggas trynna strip my from my crown
When I come around everybody acting strange
Man I still don't give a damn about your Instagram
Models ain't the only ones being slain
Man there's really been an epidemic
Only coping a mechanism of being pessimistic
Had a vision all my niggas was winning and we ain't have a limit
Baddest bitches love my music and you ain't gotta feel it
Y'all good over here fuck that side
I know a couple of my homies wearing neck ties
I knew a couple of my homies done jumped ship
They don't know that every good thing take time

It's a thin, thin, thin line between
Responsibilities
And your dreams
Everything ain't what it seems, ain't what it seems
Gotta read between
Between them lines
Scope out the scene
Scope out the scene
Cause it's the people that's close to you
That's gon rip out your soul from you
That's gon tear out your heart
You gotta know what you supposed to do
Don't lose your dreams
Don't lose your dreams
Don't lose your, dreams

[Verse 2: Marcellus Juvann]
How the hell we supposed to make it to the mutherfuckin top nigga?
Only got five in my gas tank
Now my pockets is in bad shape
I gotta be the illest nigga alive
But my bank account got me feeling last place
So, so cold I ain't cool being broke nigga
No lights, no gas, and no dinner
I really hate that you said that
Not where your head at
It's cool I know that we all born sinners
So I'm praying for a better me
So you can be a better you
And thank God for temptation
We facing them daily
They making us stronger
And now my son crazy
But I be ordained to be graced as a fetus
Never would sit in the bleachers
Coach put that boy in the game
Stacking the pennies til we make a million
We bringing the change
Dope on the scale
Got shit for sale
I'm fresh as hell
You will not see a stain
'Cept in my Vans, of course
I got one hand on my dick and one foot on the game
Keeping my family sane
You cannot fathom my family's pain
Built on instruction
I can't be corrupted
Man we got that shelter whenever it rain
Whenever it rain
[Hook]
It's a thin, thin, thin line between
Responsibilities
And your dreams
Everything ain't what it seems
Gotta read between
Between the lines

Cause it's the people that's close to you
That's gon rip out your soul from you
That's gon tear out your heart
You gotta know what you supposed to do
Don't lose your dreams
Don't lose your dreams
Don't lose your, dreams

[Verse 3: Kaiydo]
It's two type of people
There's me and there's you
You heard it
Believe that it's true
I don't take nothing for silence
You said it
I'm checking it
Asking for proof
These niggas be gullible
Don't get too comfortable
Brody might throw in advance
Know what I know then you know where I stand
Labels want lives for a couple of grand
And you can find me outside
Cause I ain't never really fit in, yeah
And all my brodies gon ride
And all my homies gon win, yeah
Young Gin√≥bili with the rock
Threw some Kobe in the mix
Baggin the dragon in me
Spitting fire plenty
Got a baddy with me she a trip
Shot with no pennies
Give me my assist
Cooler than pillows when you make a flip
And back as the kiddo
They say he too little
So line up the ruler
You won't get an inch
Yeah
When I'm the ruler you won't get an inch
I been actively stacking since back '06
All these rappers so arrogant
Still don't get [?]
How embarrassing
Keys to my city
I'm actually carrying
Ain't on the board I'm the chairman
You keeping the score
I'm ahead of it
Ain't throwing shade
I'm just making comparisons
[?] with money already done it before
(Heard it one time for a million more)
I might run it up and put the city on go
Move the alphabet around
Went from "I" to the "O"
