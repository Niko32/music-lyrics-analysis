He's my thing
Stay away from my thing
Why don't you get your oh woah woah own?
Well, he's my thing

[Verse 1]
He's my thing I kept for myself
And not for you
He's my thing I kept for myself
And nobody else

[Chorus]
He's my thing
Stay away from my thing
Why don't you get your oh woah woah own?
Well, he's my thing

[Verse 2]
Walks around in her boyfriendâ€™s clothes
Nobody knows
She goes, she goes
Where she goes

[Chorus]
He's my thing
Stay away from my thing
Why don't you get your oh woah woah own?
Well, he's my thing

He's my thing I keep on a hook
Keep on a hook
She goes, she goes
Where she goes

[Chorus]
He's my thing
Stay away from my thing
Why don't you get your oh woah woah own?
Well, he's my thing

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
He's my thing
Stay away from my thing
Why don't you get your oh woah woah own?
Well, he's my thing
