(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh)

[Verse 1]
I'm that wholesome Midwestern boy
That you want to bring home to your mama
Even though I bring you joy
Baby, I'm not the toy
You wanna play with at night
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Too many things I've seen
Too many people and places I've been
I'm thinkin' about doin' those things I shouldn't be doin'
Somethin' I've never done before

[Chorus]
I want something to
(Fuck me up)
Need somebody to
(Fuck me up)
Everyone feels like it
(Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up)
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)

I'm that little hayseed that you know
From somewhere south of Chicago
Where do I go from here?
The path, it just ain't clear
So I wanna leave it all behind

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I might go and get drunk and stoned
'Cause it's better than being only crazy
If I never come back
Wherever I end up at
Is where I was supposed to be

[Chorus]
I want something to
(Fuck me up)
Need somebody to
(Fuck me up)
You know just what I mean
(Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up)

[Outro]
(Fuck me up)
Please somebody to
(Fuck me up)
Everyone feels like it
(Fuck me up, fuck me up, fuck me up)
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh, ooh ooh ooh)
(Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh)
