I can feel a change coming again
You tell me I'm wrong, is it all pretend?

[Chorus]
But I see you there
You're looking at me
And I feel so free
There's sun outside my window
There's sun outside my window
There's sun outside my window

[Verse 2]
I can sense a shift coming from you
I guess I know you now, was it ever true?

[Chorus]
But I see you now
You're looking at me
And I feel so free
And there's sun outside my window
There's sun outside my window
There's sun outside my window

[Bridge]
I want you evermore
I want you evermore
I want you evermore
I need you evermore
You might also like[Chorus]
But I see you there
You're looking at me
And I feel so free
There's sun outside my window
There's sun outside my window
There's sun outside my window
