Spent so much time with a mask on
When I took it off I was gone
Look in the mirror, somethings wrong
Spent so much time with a mask on

[Verse 1]
In the public eye I've been seeming fine
I got so much shit to get up off my mind
Been spending time, not feeling bright
But I gotta push it all behind me

[Verse 2]
In the public eye I've been seeming fine
Every single day just to act bright
Couldn't stay inside everyday despite
Even when you're feeling dead inside
How you supposed to be a role model
When you don't know your own mottos
Still throwing up, going full bottle
Fate handed him the bottles

[Chorus]
Spent so much time with a mask on
When I took it off I was gone
Look in the mirror, somethings wrong
Spent so much time with a mask on
You might also like[Verse 3]
So much beauty hanging, him first
It's crazy how the dark can burn
Overshadow what you've learned
Make you feel like nothing's worth

[Verse 4]
So much fun at your birth
But you gotta dig it up and learn
Back, it always feels turnt
Just wait for the time to turn

[Chorus]
Spent so much time with a mask on
When I took it off I was gone
Look in the mirror, somethings wrong
Spent so much time with a mask on
