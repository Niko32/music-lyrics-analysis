[Verse 1]
Venomous by design
Lying idle, biding time
Bore down the clutch, tore up the road
Six-hundred horses, genetic code
Lightning speed, the road she bends
Slam down the brakes, losing my ass end

[Chorus]
Drive on, pushed to the limit
My Viper King, we're flying high
Drive on, filled with desire
Nothing to fear, I feel alive
My Viper King

[Verse 2]
Speed demon, tempting fate
Do or die, in the blink of an eye

[Chorus]
Drive on, pushed to the limit
My Viper King, weâ€™re flying high
Drive on, filled with desire
Nothing to fear, I feel alive
My Viper King

[Chorus]
Drive on, pushed to the limit
My Viper King, we're flying high
Drive on, filled with desire
Nothing to fear, I feel alive
My Viper King
My Viper King
My Viper King
