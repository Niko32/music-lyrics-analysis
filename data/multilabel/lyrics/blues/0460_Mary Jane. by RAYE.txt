Mary Jane
Sweet, sweet Mary Jane
When you touch my mouth
I levitate
You take these bitter thoughts in my brain
And let them fall like summer rain
Sweet Mary Jane (Sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet)

[Verse 2]
Mmm, codeine
Silent, marvellous codeine
How I miss your chemical hug
Since I've been clean, ooh
You hold me better than any man did
And no one's done it like you since
Codeine, mmm

[Chorus]
Sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet Mary Jane
And codeine can kill any pain

[Verse 3]
Mmm, red wine
You always gave me the best advice, mmm
You gave me courage (Gave me)
To call the man who makes me cry
And I bought three bottles 'cause I tend to drink you dry
Mmm, oh, how we've danced tonight
Red wine
You might also like[Chorus]
Sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet Mary Jane (Yeah)
And codeine can kill any pain

[Verse 4]
Mandy, dear
Oh, when I met you, we had quite the year
You showed me love so pure, so strong
Then left me in bed so alone
You're a stone cold bitch in the morning, aren't you?
Aren't you, Mandy?

[Chorus]
Sweet, sweet, sweet
Sweet, sweet Mary Jane (Sweet Mary Jane)
And codeine can kill any pain
