Let's go down the rabbit hole
On these streets is where I roam
Got my pack and paper sign
Spent my money buyin’ time
All I need is 50 cents
Got no bills, don't pay no rent
Got no home, life is cheap
Behind the dumpster where I sleep

[Pre Chorus]
But oh my God, look at my sin!
Drunk off a bottle full of homemade gin!
Ragged old coat, hole in my shoe
Just need a dollar for a can of beef stew

[Chorus]
'Scuse me there mister, can you spare a dime?
Haven’t had a meal for a very long time
Even just a nickel, I'll be on my way
Can you help me out buddy, whaddaya say?
I said requiem, requiem
What do you expect from a dirty ol' bum
Requiem, requiem, requiem of the crazies

[Verse 2]
I think my mind is slippin'
There's voices in my brain
There's poison in the water
Slowly driving me insane
I think I'm being followed
They watch my every move
No one believes me 'cause it’s all impossible to prove
You might also like[Pre Chorus]
But oh my God, it’s all in my head
Just hangin' on by a sliver of thread
Rotten brown teeth, haven’t had a bath
Better hold your breath if we ever cross paths

[Chorus]
I said, pardon me brother, could you spare a dime?
I haven't had a meal for a very long time
Even just a quarter, I'll be on my way
Can ya help me out buddy, waddaya say?
I said requiem, requiem
What do you expect from a dirty ol' bum
Requiem, requiem, requiem of the crazies
Requiem, requiem, requiem of the crazies
Requiem, requiem, requiem of the crazies
