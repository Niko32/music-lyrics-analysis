Hmm
Oh oh oh

[Verse]
When it comes to bury me
Put a fifth of rum in my hand
Might as well come and take my soul
I won't make it to the promised land

[Pre-Chorus]
In my time of dying
I don't want nobody to mourn
All I want for my friends to do
Is to fold up my dying arms

[Chorus]
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Well, well, well
So I can die easy
Well, so I can die easy
The devil's gonna make up my dying bedYou might also like
