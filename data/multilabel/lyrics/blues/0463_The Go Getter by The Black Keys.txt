The go-getter
I'll be the go-getter
Yes I am, I'll be the go-getter
That's my plan, the go-getter

[Verse 1]
Hi-fi boom box
Pretty girl in bobby socks
After party in a hotel room
Pretty soon there will be no moon
Stumble home in the pourin' rain
Let the water ease my worried brain
Some days I just can't get along
I need a head to lean my shoulders on

[Pre-Chorus]
Palm trees, the flat broke disease
And LA has got me on my knees
I am the bluest of blues
Every day, a different, different way to lose

[Chorus]
The go-getter
The go-getter, the go-getter
You might also like[Verse 2]
I got a table at the Rainbow Room
I told my wife I'd be home soon
Big ships are approaching the docks
I got my hi-fi boom box
Mashed potatoes in cellophane
I see my life goin' down the drain
Hold me baby and don't let go
Pretty girls help to soften the blow, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Palm trees, the flat broke disease
And LA has got me on my knees
I am the bluest of blues
Every day, a different way to lose

[Chorus]
The go-getter, the go-getter
The go-getter, I'll be the, the go-getter
That's my plan, that's who I am
The go-getter, yeah, the go-getter
