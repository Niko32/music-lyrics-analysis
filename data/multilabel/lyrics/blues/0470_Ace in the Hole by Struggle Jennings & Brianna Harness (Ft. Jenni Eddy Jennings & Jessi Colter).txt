Always takin' the wrong roads
Been misreading the signs
’Cause the map I was given
Was written in lies
I found safety on the sidewalk
As your hand reached for mine
You pulled me out
At just the right time

[Chorus: Struggle Jennings & Brianna Harness]
You were sent here from heaven
To hold my hand through hell
I could stay here forever
You take the pain I've known too well
I pray that this moment lasts longer
Than the heartbreaks I have felt
You're my ace in the hole
For the cards I was dealt

[Verse 2: Jenni Eddy Jennings]
The hands on that old clock
Seem to stop in your arms
The dark disappears
Now my heart’s free from harm
They say nothin' lasts forever
But this feelin's a first
We slow dance in my dreams
You're my heaven on earth
You might also like[Chorus: Struggle Jennings & Jenni Eddy Jennings]
You were sent here from heaven
To hold my hand through hell
I could stay here forever
You take the pain I've known too well
I pray that this moment lasts longer
Than the heartbreaks I have felt
You're my ace in the hole
For the cards I was dealt

[Verse 3: Jessi Colter]
The light in the tunnel
Was a train movin' fast
As I hold onto you
I let go of my past
The war has been won
For love conquers all
When you lift me up
There's no way I can fall

[Chorus: Struggle Jennings & Jessi Colter]
You were sent here from heaven
To hold my hand through hell
I could stay here forever
You take the pain I’ve known too well
I pray that this moment lasts longer
Than the heartbreaks I have felt
You’re my ace in the hole
For the cards I was dealt
For the cards I was dealt
