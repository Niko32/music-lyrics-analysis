(Ooh)
You can preach it, you can teach it
Do you believe it? (Why do you believe?)
You can preach it, you can teach it
Do you believe it? (Whoo yeah)
You can preach it, you can teach it
Do you believe it? (Do you believe it?)
You can preach it, you can teach it, oh (oh)

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

[Verse 1: Sam Getz]
I got my back up to the edge of the room
You left me nowhere to hide
Your words of venom spitting salt in my wounds
'Cause I'm paralyzed
Whoa, whoa, whoa

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Getz, (Bri & Jon Bryant)]
Feet in the clouds, my head on the ground
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm begging you, please
Just take me down to the river to drown
You might also like[Chorus: Bri & Jon Bryant, (Sam Getz)]
You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it? (Take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it?

[Verse 2: Sam Getz]
It's getting clearer to me every day
You leave the wake of destruction
All this talk
Is still gonna leave me with nothing

[Pre-Chorus: Sam Getz, (Bri & Jon Bryant)]
Feet in the clouds, my head on the ground
(Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa)
I'm begging you, please
Just take me down to the river to drown

[Chorus: Bri & Jon Bryant, (Sam Getz)]
You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it? (Take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it? (Just take me down to the river to drown)
You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it? (Just take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it? (Take me down to the river)
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Sam Getz]
You never think about the crazy things you always say
I wonder if you even notice that you stand in my way
Won't feel when you figure it out
Just take me down to the river to drown

[Chorus (Breakdown): Bri & Jon Bryant, (Sam Getz)]
You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it? (Take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it? (Take me down to the river to drown)
You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it? (Take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it? (Just take me down to the river to drown)

[Chorus: Bri & Jon Bryant, (Sam Getz)]
You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it (Take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it (Hey! Take me down to the river to drown)
You can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it (Oh, take me down to the river to drown)
'Cause you can preach it, and you can teach it
But do you believe it (Oh, just take me down to the river)
[Outro: Bri & Jon Bryant, Sam Getz]
Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river
Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river, down to the river
Down to the river
