I got a heart full of trouble, a house full of sin
Things are bad as they ever been
If trouble were money
I'd have more money than any man should

[Chorus]
I'm open for business in your neighborhood
The blues is my business, and business is good

[Verse 2]
If I had a dollar for every broken heart
I'd be drinkin' fine wine and eatin' caviar
If trouble were money
I'd have more money than any man should, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm open for business in your neighborhood
The blues is my business, and business is good, yes

[Bridge]
Business, and business is good
The blues is my business, and business is good
The blues is my business, the blues is my business
I'm open for business in your neighborhood
The blues is my business, and business is good
You might also like[Bridge]
Alright
Oh, alright, yeah
Hey, hey, hey, hey

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
It's a world full of trouble, a world full of pain
I'll take the profit, I won't take no blame
If trouble were money
I'd have more money than any man should

[Chorus]
I'm open for business in your neighborhood
The blues is my business, and business is good

[Bridge]
The blues is my business, and business is good
The blues is my business, and business is good
The blues is my business, the blues is my business

[Chorus]
I'm open for business in your neighborhood
The blues is my business, and business is good
[Outro]
The blues is my business, the blues is my business
The blues is my business
The blues is my business and business is good
I'm open for business in your neighborhood
The blues is my business, and business is good
The blues is my business
The blues is my business and business is good
Yeah
