My heart it beats for you
Though we are miles apart
My lovin', it will always follow you
More and more each day
My heart it beats for you
And when the sun sleeps at night
It's the perfect time 'cause I get to dream of you
While waiting for the morning light

[Chorus]
Oceans that crash along the shore
Return to calmer waves across the sea
A moment of clarity
No matter what the future holds
It's you my heart beats for

[Verse 2]
And you are like the stars
That no matter where you are
I don't feel so far away, and whеn night falls
You always light the way
And I am but a man (But a man I am)
Orbiting 'round your sun ('Round your sun I am)
And it's you that makes my day
After day (Day aftеr day, oh-oh-oh)
You might also like[Chorus]
Oceans that crash along the shore
Return to calmer waves across the sea
A moment of clarity
That my love remains an open door
So welcome yourself in
Come in

[Outro]
No matter what the future holds
Para sayo lang tumitibok ang puso ko
Yeah, no matter what the future holds
It's you my heart beats for
Mmm, yeah
It's you my heart beats for
Do-do-do
It's you my heart beats for
