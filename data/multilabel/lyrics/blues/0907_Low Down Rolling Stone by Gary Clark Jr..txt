Something's going on with me
I'm not who I used to be, no
Reach the point where darkness is my comfort zone
I know it's not what you came here for

[Pre-Chorus]
So fly like an eagle
Go be beautiful and free, girl

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm better off on my own
Go save your soul
You don't wanna go where I go
I'm just a lowdown rolling stone
Barely hanging on
I'm just a lowdown rolling stone, huh
I'm barely hanging on, so

[Post-Chorus]
Please help me ease my mind
Please help me ease my mind

[Verse 2]
Temptation's got a hold of me
I'm not where I'm supposed to be
You're only here for the thrill, it's not where you belong
I know I'm no one you can depend on
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So fly like an eagle
Go be beautiful and free, girl

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm better off on my own
Go save your soul
You don't wanna go where I go
I'm just a lowdown rolling stone
I'm better off on my own
Go save your soul
You don't wanna go where I go
I'm just a lowdown rolling stone
Barely hanging on

[Bridge]
There you go, in the clouds again
There you go, in the clouds again
There you go, making rounds again
And I'm only gonna bring you down, so

[Chorus]
I'm better off on my own
Go save your soul
You don't wanna go where I go
I'm just a lowdown rolling stone
Oh, round
You don't wanna go where I go, baby, no
