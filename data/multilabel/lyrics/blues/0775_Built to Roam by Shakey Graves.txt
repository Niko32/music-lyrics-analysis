This lazy living, yeah it sure tastes good
Oh, let's make a killing down in Hollywood
And buy ourselves some nice fancy home in the hills
Spend all our fancy ol' time spending ten dollar bills

[Verse 2]
Watch out
Cause here I come, bored and lazy
Here I come, no dignity
So long sad city of angels
You ain't been very good to me
Yeah, you take that blood right from my body
Oh, you take the bone out of my spine
So long sunny California
You ain't no friend of mine

[Verse 3]
So New York City yeah I'll see you soon
Oh, spend all my money on some elbow room
Yeah, wander around like I got someplace fancy to go
Oh, I'm the king of Brooklyn for all you know

[Verse 4]
Watch out
Cause here I come, bored and lazy
Yeah here I come just passing through
Oh follow me beyond the mountain
Go howl the ol' big moon
Yeah strip them clothes right off your body
Dress your skin in sticks and stones
Doesn't matter where we're headed cause
Some of us were built
Some of us were built
Some of us were built to roamYou might also like
