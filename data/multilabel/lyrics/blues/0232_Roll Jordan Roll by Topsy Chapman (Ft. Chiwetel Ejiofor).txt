Where John baptized three
Well, I woke the devil in hell
Said, "John ain't baptized me!"

I said roll, Jordan, roll (oh now)
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul'll rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan rolls

Well, some say John was a baptist (Some say)
Some say John was a Jew (Hallelujah)
But I say John was a preacher of God
And my Bible says so too

I said roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul'll rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan rolls

Hallelujah!

Roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul'll rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan rolls
You might also likeHallelujah!

Roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul'll rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan rolls

Everybody sing!

Roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul'll rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan rolls

Roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul'll rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan rolls

Hallelujah!

Roll, Jordan, roll
Roll, Jordan, roll
My soul'll rise in heaven, Lord
For the year when Jordan rolls
