You had plenty money in 1922
You let other women make a fool of you

[Chorus]
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Get out of here, get me some money too

[Verse 2]
You're sittin' down wonderin' what it's all about
If you ain't got no money they will put you out

[Chorus]
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Get out of here, get me some money too

[Verse 3]
If you had prepared twenty years ago
You wouldn't be wanderin' now from door to door

[Chorus]
Why don't you do right like some other men do?
Get out of here, get me some money too

[Outro]
Get out of here, get me some money too
Why don't you do right, like some other men, do?You might also like
