You can keep what you want
I want none of this
They're just bad memories
I don't want
In my sunshine (shine, shine)
You can pack it all up
And be gone
And be gone

[Verse 2]
If it matters to you
You can sell it all up
If the price feels right
I won't judge
If you get off your knees
You'll be out on the breeze
Take a lesson from me
Don't get stuck on a dreamYou might also like
