Yeah, your mother was cheaper
Every time that I see her
And she got the right motion
But she ain't got no devotion

[Pre-Chorus]
And I still think about this
And all the things I thought I'd never miss
We went real off track
Yeah, girl, none of this time is coming back

[Chorus]
'Cause it's been too, too, too long, yeah
Too, too, too long, yeah
Too, too, too long, yeah
Too, too, too long, yeah

[Verse 2]
You see you're glad that it's over
As you're pulling me closer
Always been that dramatic
Life's been less fun without it

[Pre-Chorus]
And I still think about this
And all the things I thought I'd never miss
We went real off that track
Yeah, girl, none of this time is coming back
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause it's been too, too, too long, yeah
Too, too, too long, yeah
Too, too, too long, yeah
Too, too, too long, yeah

[Bridge]
I can't let you go
Yeah, I can't let you know
Yeah, I can't let you go
Yeah, I can't let you know

[Chorus]
'Cause it's been too, too, too long, yeah
Too, too, too long, yeah
Too, too, too long, yeah
Too, too, too long, yeah
Too, too, too long, yeah
Too, too, too long, yeah
Too, too, too long, yeah
Too, too, too long, yeah
