When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus]
So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me

[Verse 2]
If the sky that we look upon (ah-oo)
Should tumble and fall
The mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Chorus]
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And darlin', darlin', stand by me, stand by me
Oh, stand by me, oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me
You might also like[Outro]
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me
