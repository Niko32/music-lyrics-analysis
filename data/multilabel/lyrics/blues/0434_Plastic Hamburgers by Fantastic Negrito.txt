Oh, automatic weapon lord
Automatic weapon in a twitching hand
Hmm, and they’re winning in a twitching hand

[Verse 1]
American pills will wreck 'n kill
American pills will wreck 'n kill
Automatic weapon in a twitching hand
The 50-foot wall of addiction, man
Do you, do you understand?

[Chorus]
Let’s break out these chains, let’s burn it down
Let’s break out these chains, let’s burn it down
Let’s break out these chains, let’s burn it down
Let’s break out these chains, let’s burn it down

[Verse 2]
A Ni-ni-nine inchs penis underneath a dress
She wanted everything that he did not have
And If we keep buying everything that sells
American pills will wreck n' kill us, yes they will

[Chorus]
You gotta break out these chains, let’s burn it down
Let’s break out these chains, let’s burn it down
Let’s break out these chains, let’s burn it down
Let’s break out these chains, let’s burn it down

[Verse 3]
Hegemony born with a winning hand
Hegemony born with a winning hand
People get caught underneath the spell
Oh, they keep buying everything that sell
For the thrill

[Chorus]
Break out these chains, let’s burn it down
Let’s break out these chains, let’s burn it down
Let’s break out these chains, let’s burn it down
Let’s break out these chains, let’s burn it down
