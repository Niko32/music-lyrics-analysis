Good dog
Stay
Bad dog
Whoo
Down
Roll over

[Verse 1]
Well, here's a good man and a pretty young girl
Trying to play together somehow
I'm wasting my life, you're changing the world
I get drunk and watch your head grow

[Pre-Chorus]
It's the good times that we shared
And the bad times that we'll have
It's the good times
And the bad times that we had

[Chorus]
Well it's been a long slow collision
I'm a pitbull, you're a dog
Baby you're foul in clear conditions
But you're handsome in the fog
So I need some fine wine
And you, you need to be nicer
For the good times and the bad times
That we'll have
You might also like[Verse 2]
Sometimes we talk over dinner like old friends
Till I go and kill the bottle
I go off over any old thing
Break your heart and raise a glass or ten

[Pre-Chorus]
To the good times that we shared
And the bad times that we'll have
To the good times
And the bad times that we've had

[Chorus]
Well it's been a long slow collision
I'm a pitbull, you're a dog
Baby you're foul in clear conditions
But you're handsome in the fog
So I need some fine wine
And you, you need to be nicer
For the good times and the bad times
We know will come, yeah

I need some fine wine
And you, you need to be nicer
We need to be nicer
You and me
For the good times
And the bad times that we had
[Outro]
Sit
Good times
Bad times
Sweet wine
Bad wine
Good cop
Bad cop
Lapdog
Bad dog
Sit
