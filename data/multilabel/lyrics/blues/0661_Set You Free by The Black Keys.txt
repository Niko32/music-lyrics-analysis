You hold on to love that's gone
Run a mile to see him smile
But you don't know, he's door to door
Playin' you for the fool

[Chorus]
Let him go
Walk out your door
And come to me
I'm going to set you free

[Verse 2]
Now you know, there you go
Back to him, he gonna do you in
Tear you down and run you around
Treat you wrong and then he's gone

[Chorus]
Let him go
To walk out your door
And come to me
I'm going to set you free

[Verse 3]
You hold on to love that is gone
Run a mile to see him smile
But you don't know, he is door to door
Playin' you for the fool
You might also like[Chorus]
Let him go
Walk out the door
And come to me
I'm gonna set you free

[Outro]
I'll set you free
I'll set you free
I'll set you free
I'll set you free
I'll set you free
