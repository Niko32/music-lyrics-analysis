(Fuck)

[Verse 1]
Life tasted sweet when I was the bad twin
Devil himself sat waving me by
All of my tattoos, they were of no use
No monetary values have I

[Chorus]
Ooh, won't be long 'til I belong

[Verse 2]
Bird at my window tells me tomorrow
Mean old tornado carries me off
Pulls me from bed and bashes my head in
Buries me halfway across the globe

[Chorus]
Ooh, won't be long 'til I belong
Without all of this unlucky skin

[Chorus]
Ooh, won't be long 'til I belong
Without all of that unlucky skin
You might also like[Verse 3]
Think of me often, loosen my coffin
Let all the bugs in my wooden home

[Chorus]
Ooh, won't be long 'til I belong
Without all of this unlucky skin
