I'm so high and so dry
I'm sailin' in the sky
Just blow some gage
I'm on a rampage
Jack, I'm mellow

[Hook 2]
I'm so high and so dry
I'm way up in the sky
The world seems light
And I'm so right
Jack, I'm mellow

[Verse 1]
I'm going to put my nickel in a slot machine
And play my solid sender
I'm going to strut, peck and Suzie-Q
'Cause I'm on a bender

[Hook 3]
I'm so high and so dry
I'm sailin' in the sky
I got my roach around
I can't come down
Jack, I'm mellow
