Come love come, the road lies low
The way is long and hard I know
Come love come, the road lies free
I'll wait for you in Tennessee

[Verse 1]
When I was four, my loving mam
Was cornered by the boss' man
She turned her head and got struck down
They buried her in the cold, cold ground

[Chorus]
Come love come, the road lies low
The way is long and hard, I know
Come love come, the road lies free
I'll wait for you in Tennessee

[Verse 2]
When I was twelve, my father dear
Was strong of arm and free of fear
Until the day he raised his hand
Then he was sold to Alabam'

[Chorus]
Come love come, the road lies low
The way is long and hard, I know
Come love come, the road lies free
I'll wait for you in Tennessee
You might also like[Verse 3]
I was sixteen, found my bloom
And found my man, we jumped the broom
We pledged each other the rest of our lives
And on Saturday nights, we were man and wife

[Chorus]
Come love come, the road lies low
The way is long and hard, I know
Come love come, the road lies free
I'll wait for you in Tennessee

[Verse 4]
I was eighteen, bugles called
The boys in blue came o'er the wall
I took my chance and followed free
They led the way to Tennessee

[Chorus]
Come love come, the road lies low
The way is long and hard, I know
Come love come, the road lies free
I'll wait for you in Tennessee

[Verse 5]
Here I sit in a tiny shack
With thirteen others at my back
I've sent you word, so all I can do
Is wait, and wait, and wait, and wait, and wait
And wait for you
[Chorus]
Come love come, the road lies low
The way is long and hard, I know
Come love come, the road lies free
I'll wait for you in Tennessee
Come love come, the road lies low
The way is long and hard, I know
Come love come, the road lies free
I'll wait for you in Tennessee

[Outro]
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
I'll wait for you
