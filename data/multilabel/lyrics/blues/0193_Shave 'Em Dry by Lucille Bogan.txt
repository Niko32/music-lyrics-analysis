I got somethin' between my legs'll make a dead man come
Oh daddy, baby won't you shave 'em dry?
Now, draw it out!
Want you to grind me baby, grind me until I cry

Say I fucked all night, and all the night before baby
And I feel just like I wanna, fuck some more
Oh great God daddy
Grind me honey and shave me dry
And when you hear me holler baby
Want you to shave it dry

I got nipples on my titties, big as the end of my thumb
Daddy you say that's the kind of 'em you want, and you can make 'em come
Oh, daddy shave me dry
And I'll give you somethin' baby
Swear it'll make you cry

I'm gon' turn back my mattress, and let you oil my springs
I want you to grind me daddy, 'til the bell do ring
Oh daddy, want you to shave 'em dry
Oh great God daddy, if you can't shave 'em baby won't you try?

Now if fuckin' was the thing, that would take me to heaven
I'd be fuckin' in the studio, till the clock strike eleven
Oh daddy, daddy shave 'em dry
I would fuck you baby, honey I'd make you cry

And your dick stands up like a steeple
Your goddam ass-hole stands open like a church door
And the crabs walks in like people
Ow, shit!
Ooh!
Baby, won't you shave 'em dry

A big sow gets fat from eatin' corn
And a pig gets fat from suckin'
Reason you see this whore, fat like I am
Great God, I got fat from fuckin'
Eeeeh! Shave 'em dry

My back is made of whalebone
And my cock is made of brass
And my fuckin' is made for workin' men's two dollars
Great God, round to kiss my ass
Oh! Whoo, daddy, shave 'em dry
