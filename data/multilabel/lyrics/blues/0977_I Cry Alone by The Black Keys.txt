My girl, my girl had a hold on me
So tight, so tight that I could not see
Girl, she had a hold on me
She held so tight that I could not see
My girl, my girl had a hold on me

[Verse 2]
One day, one day I let her go
It hurt, it hurt so you'll never know
The day I had to let her go
It hurt so bad that you cannot know
One day, one day I let her go

[Verse 3]
At night, at night I cry alone
I weep, I weep 'til the early morn'
At night, at night I cry alone
I weep all night, 'til the early mornin'
At night, at night I cry aloneYou might also like
