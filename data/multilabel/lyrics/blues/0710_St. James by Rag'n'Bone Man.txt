On the corner, by the stairs
Drinks were served as usual
And the usual crowd was there
On my left stood Joe McKennedy
His eyes were bloodshot red
And he turned to face the crowd around him
These are the very words he said:

"I went down to St. James infirmary
Saw my baby lying there
Stretched out on a long white table
So cold, so deep, so fair
Let her go, let her go, Lord bless her
Wherever she may be
And I can search this whole world right over
You'll never find a sweet man like me"

When I die, please bury me
Outside of Stetson hat
Put a gold piece on my watch chain
So the boys will know that I died standing fair

I want six gamblers to be my pallbearers
I want a working girl to sing me a song
I want a jazz band on my hearse wagon
To raise hell as we roll along
You might also likeNow that you've heard my story
I'll take another shot of the booze
And if anybody should ask me
Tell'em I got me those gamblin' blues
Tell'em I got me those gamblin' blues
Tell'em I got me those gamblin' blues
