Now, listen, honey, while I say
How can you tell me that you're going away?
Don't say that we must part
Don't break my achin' heart
You know I love you true for many years
Love you night and day
How can you leave me, can't you see my tears?
So, listen while I say

[Chorus]
After you've gone, and left me cryin'
After you've gone, there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the dearest pal you ever had
There'll come a time, now, don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine, and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone away

[Chorus]
After you've gone left me cryin'
After you've gone there's no denyin'
You'll feel blue, you'll feel sad
You'll miss the best pal you ever had
Lord, there'll come a time, now don't forget it
There'll come a time when you'll regret it
Someday when you grow lonely
Your heart will break like mine, and you'll want me only
After you've gone, after you've gone awayYou might also like
