When I'm drinkin’ whiskey, I know nothing can go wrong
When I'm drinkin' whiskey, only time my mind is strong
When I got my bottle is when I’m standing tall
'Cause when I'm drinkin' whiskey, I don't feel nothing at all

[Verse 2]
When I'm good and drunken, can't nobody bring me down
I like to drink my whiskey when nobody is around
I know my empty bottle is the only one that understands
When I'm drinkin’ whiskey, I forget the man I am

[Verse 3]
When I’m drinkin' whiskey, my hands don’t ever shake
When I'm drinkin' whiskey, I don't lie in bed awake
’Cause when I got my bottle, I don't care if I'm alive
'Cause when I'm drinkin' whiskey, I ain't afraid to die
'Cause when I'm drinkin' whiskey, I ain't afraid to dieYou might also like
