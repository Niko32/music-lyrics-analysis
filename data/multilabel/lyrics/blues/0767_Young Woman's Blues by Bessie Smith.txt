Woke up this mornin' when chickens was crowin' for day
And on the right side of my pillow, my man had gone away
By his pillow he left a note
Readin', "I'm sorry, Jane, you got my goat
No time to marry, no time to settle down"

[Verse 2]
I'm a young woman and ain't done runnin' 'round
I'm a young woman and ain't done runnin' 'round
Some people call me a hobo, some call me a bum
Nobody knows my name, nobody knows what I've done
I'm as good as any woman in your town

[Verse 3]
I ain't no high yeller, I'm a tequila brown
I ain't gonna marry, ain't gon' settle down
I'm gon' drink good moonshine, and run these browns down
See that long lonesome road, Lawd?  You know it's got a end
And I'm a good woman, and I can get plenty menYou might also like
