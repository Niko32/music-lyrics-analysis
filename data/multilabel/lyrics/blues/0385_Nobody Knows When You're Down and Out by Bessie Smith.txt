Once I lived a life of a millionaire
Spendin' my money, I didn't care
I carried my friends out for a good time
Buy bootleg liquor, champagne, and wine

[Verse 2]
When I begin to fall so low
I didn't have a friend and no place to go
But if I ever get my hands on a dollar again
I'm gonna hold on to it 'til them eagles grin

[Verse 3]
Nobody knows you
When you down and out
In my pocket not one penny
And my friends, I haven't any

[Verse 4]
But if I ever get on my feet again
And I'll meet my long-lost friend
It's mighty strange without a doubt
Nobody knows you when you down and out
I mean, when you down and out

Mmm
When you down and out
Mmm, not one penny
And my friends, I haven't any

[Verse 6]
Mmm, and I fell so low
Nobody wants me 'round their door
Mmm, without a doubt
No man can use you when you down and out
I mean when you down and out
