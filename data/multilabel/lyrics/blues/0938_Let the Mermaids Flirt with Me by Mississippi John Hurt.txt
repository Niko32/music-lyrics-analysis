Blues all on the ocean
Blues all in the air
Can't stay here no longer
I have no steamship fare

[Chorus]
When my earthly trials are over
Cast my body out in the sea
Save all the undertaker bills
Let the mermaids flirt with me

[Verse 2]
I do not work for pleasure
Earthly peace I'll see no more
The only reason I work at all
Is to drive the wolves from my door

[Chorus]
When my earthly trials are over
Cast my body out in the sea
Save all the undertaker bills
Let the mermaids flirt with me

[Verse 3]
My wife controls our unhappy home
A sweetheart I can not find
The only thing I can call my own
Is a troubled and a worried mind
You might also like[Chorus]
When my earthly trials are over
Cast my body out in the sea
Save all the undertaker bills
Let the mermaids flirt with me

[Verse 4]
Blues all in my body
My darling has forsaken me
If I ever see her face again
I have to swim across the sea

[Chorus]
When my earthly trials are over
Cast my body out in the sea
Save all the undertaker bills
Let the mermaids flirt with me

[Verse 5]
Blues all on the ocean
Blues all in the air
Can't stay here no longer
I have no steamship fare

[Chorus]
When my earthly trials are over
Cast my body out in the sea
Save all the undertaker bills
Let the mermaids flirt with me
