I met a girl at the cabaret
Said "Pretty papa, I'm going your way"
Her man know what it all about
Waiting home just to throw me out
Broke my nose, split my chin
"Don't let me catch you here again"
He whipped me from the kitchen back through the door
He beat me with a chair 'til my head got sore
That'll never happen no more
That'll never happen no more

[Instrumental Breakdown]

[Verse 2]
Live in Chicago winter and fall
And it got me to wear my overall
Got broke, was my fault
Used to eatin' pork chops and [?] salt
I met a woman with a big mink fur
Big fat-mouth me followed her
She pulled a gun, take my [dough?]
Couldn't eb'n holler and I didn't get sore
That'll never happen no more
That'll never happen no more

[Outro]
That'll never happen no more
That'll never happen to me no more
