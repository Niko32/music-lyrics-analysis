On the wings of a magpie cross a hooligan night
And I busted up a chifferobe way out by the kokomo
Cooked up a mess of mulligan and got into a fight

Whistling past the graveyard stepping on a crack
Me and mother hubbard papa one-eyed Jack

You probably seen me sleepin out by the railroad tracks
Go on and ask the prince of darkness
What about all that smoke come from the stack
Sometimes I kill myself a jackal suck out all the blood
Steal myself a station wagon driving through the mud

I'm gonna be whistlin' past the graveyard steppin' on a crack
Me and mother hubbard papa one-eyed Jack

I know you seen my headlights and the honkin of my horn
I'm callin out my bloodhounds chase the devil through the corn
Last night I chugged the Mississippi now that suckers dry as a bone
I was born in a taxi cab I'm never going home

Whistling past the graveyard stepping on a crack
Me and mother hubbard Papa one-eyed Jack

My eyes have seen the glory of the draining of the ditch
I only come to Baton Rouge I gotta find myself a witch
I'm gonna snatch me up a couple of em every time it rains
You'll see a locomotive probably thinking its a train

Me and mother hubbard Papa one-eyed Jack

What you think is the sunshine is just a twinkle in my eye
That ring around my fingers called the fourth of July
When I get a little bit lonesome and a tear falls from my cheek
There's gonna be an ocean in the middle of the week

Whistling past the graveyard stepping on a crack
Me and mother hubbard Papa one-eyed Jack

I come into town on a night train with an arm full of boxcars
On the wings of a magpie cross a hooligan night
I'm gonna tear me off a rainbow and wear it for a tie
I never told the truth so I can never tell a lie

Whistling past the graveyard stepping on a crack
Me and mother hubbard Papa one-eyed Jack
