So you're a little bit older and a lot less bolder
Than you used to be
So you used to shake 'em down
But now you stop and think about your dignity
So now sweet sixteen's turned thirty-one
You get to feelin' weary when the work day's done
Well all you got to do is get up and into your kicks
If you're in a fix
Come back baby
Rock and roll never forgets

[Verse 2]
You better get yourself a partner
Go down to the concert or the local bar
Check the local newspaper
Chances are you won't have to go too far
Yeah the rafters will be ringing 'cause the beat's so strong
The crowd will be swaying and singing along
And all you got to do is get in into the mix
If you need a fix
You can come back baby
Rock and roll never forgets

[Bridge]
Ooh the band's still playing it loud and lean
Listen to the guitar player making it scream
All you got to do is just make that scene tonight
Hey tonight, ooh
You might also like[Verse 3]
Well now sweet sixteen's turned thirty-one
Feel a little tired feeling under the gun
Well all of Chuck's children are out there playing his licks
Get into your kicks
And come back baby
Rock and roll never forgets
Said you can come back baby
Rock and roll never forgets
Oh come back baby
Rock and roll never forgets

[Outro]
Ooh, oh yeah, oh yeah
Huh, uh huh, uh huh
Never forgets, oh no, oh no
Ooh, never forgets
Ah yeah, ooh
Ooh, never forgets
Hey
Never forgets, yeah, oh oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh
Ah yeah
Ooh, never forgets
Never never forgets, oh no, oh no
