Well, these diamonds on my windshield
And these tears from heaven
Well, I'm pulling into town on the Interstate
I got a steel train in the rain
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing
And it's these late nights and this freeway flying
It always makes me sing

[Verse 2]
There's a Duster trying to change my tune
He's pulling up fast on the right
Rolling restlessly by a 24-hour moon
And a Wisconsin hiker with a cue-ball head
He's wishing he's home in a Wisconsin bed
But there's fifteen feet of snow in the east
Colder than a well-digger's ass
And it's colder than a well-digger's ass

[Verse 3]
Oceanside, it ends the ride
With San Clemente coming up
Those Sunday desperados slip by
And cruise with a dry back
And the orange drive-in, the neon billing
And the theatre's filling to the brim
With slave girls and a hot spurned bucket full of sin
Metropolitan area with interchange and connections
Fly-by-nights from Riverside
And out-of-state plates running a little late
But the sailors jockey for the fast lane
So 101, don't miss it
There's rolling hills and concrete fields
And the broken line's on your mind
You might also like[Verse 4]
The eights go east and the fives go north
And the merging nexus back and forth
You see your sign, cross the line
Signaling with a blink
And the radio's gone off the air
And it gives you time to think

[Verse 5]
And you hear the rumble
As you fumble for a cigarette
And blazing through this midnight jungle
Remember someone that you met
And one more block
The engine talks
Whispers "home at last"
It whispers "home at last"
Whispers "home at last"
Whispers "home at last"
Whispers "home at last"

[Verse 1]
And the diamonds on my windshield
And these tears from heaven
Well I'm pulling into town on the Interstate
I got me a steel train in the rain
And the wind bites my cheek through the wing
Late nights and freeway flying
Always makes me sing
[Outro]
It always makes me sing
Hey, look here, Jack
Okay
