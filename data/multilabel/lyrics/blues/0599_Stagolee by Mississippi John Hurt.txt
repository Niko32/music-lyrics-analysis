Stagolee was a bad man
Now, they go down in a coal mine one night
[Robbed?] a coal mine
They's gambling down there
And they placed themselves just like they wanted to be
So they wouldn't hit each other when they was shooting
Money lying all over the floor
There was one bad guy down there--he thought he was
That's Billy De Lyon
So he had a big .45 laying down by the side of him
When they got placed, why, Stagolee spoke to him
He says, "Boys, look at the money lying down here on the floor"
Says, "What do we do if old Stagolee and them was to walk in here?"
This guy picked up his .45, he says
"Ah, it wouldn't make a bit of difference"
Says, "Stag's gun won't shoot a bit harder than this one"
About that time, Stag knocked his hat off
And his partner, taking care of the rest
When he knocked his hat off he
He kind of remembered that was Stagolee
And he commenced begging like this

[Verse 1]
Policin' officer, how can it be?
You can 'rest everybody but cruel Stagolee
That bad man, oh, cruel Stagolee

He said, "Stagolee, Stagolee, please don't take my life"
Says, "I got two little babies, and a darlin' lovin' wife"
He's a bad man, oh, cruel Stagolee

[Spoken]
Here's the answer Stagolee gave him

[Verse 3]
"What I care about your two little babies, darlin' lovin' wife?"
Says, "You done stole my Stetson hat, I'm bound to take your life"
It's a magic hat, oh, cruel Stagolee

[Verse 4]
Boom, boom, boom, boom, with a forty-four
When I spied poor Billy De Lyon, he is lyin' down on the floor
That bad man, oh cruel Stagolee

[Verse 5]
"Gentleman of the jury, what you think of that?"
Says, "Stagolee killed Billy de Lyon about a five-dollar Stetson hat"
He's a bad man, oh, cruel Stagolee

[Verse 6]
Standing on the gallows, Stagolee did curse
The Judge said, "Let's kill him, for he killed some of us"
He's a bad man, oh, cruel Stagolee
[Verse 7]
Standing on the gallows, his head was way up high
At twelve o'clock they killed him, they's all glad to see him die
He's a bad man, oh, cruel Stagolee

[Verse 8]
Policin' officer, how can it be?
You can 'rest everybody but cruel Stagolee
That bad man, oh, cruel Stagolee
