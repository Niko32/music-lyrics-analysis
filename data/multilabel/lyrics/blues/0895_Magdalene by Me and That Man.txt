If I come to you
Will you be the one for me?
If I come to you
Will you be the one who bleeds?

[Bridge]
If I call your name
If I call your name
Will you always follow me?

[Verse 2]
If I walk the waters
Would you take the risk and trust me?
If I turn water into wine
Would you be my girl, would you cross that line?

[Bridge]
If I call your name
If I call your name
Will you always follow me?

[Chorus]
Lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
If I call your name
if I call your name
will you always follow me?

[Verse 3]
If I come to you
Will you be the one for me?
If I fall on my knees,
Would you grab a brick, throw a stone at me?

[Bridge]
If I call your name
If I call your name
Will you always follow me?

[Chorus]
Lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover
Lover, lover, lover, lover
