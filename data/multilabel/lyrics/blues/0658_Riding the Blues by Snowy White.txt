[Verse 1]
Livin’ is easy if you take the time to Wonder
You’re gonna feel Stronger
When you’re riding with the Blues

[Refrain]
‘Cause it’s a long, a long Road
And there’s so many ways To Go

[Verse 2]
Now you won’t be Crazy No you won’t lose your Mind
If you get on out of this lonesome place
Where day is darker than the Night

[Refrain]
And take the long, long Road
‘Cause there’s so many ways To Go

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Now I’m searchin’ for Glory, Love and All
Ain’t gonna take me down
‘Cause riding these Blues it
Keeps my feet on the Ground

Oh Lord
Don’t Let Me Fade Away...
