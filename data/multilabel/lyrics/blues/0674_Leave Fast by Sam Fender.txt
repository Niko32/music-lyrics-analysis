Dark grey vistas of this weathered place
The blue star on The Nautilus
The old boys like chimneys
Mass of filth and rubbish outside the houses
And broken fridges and torn up sofas
The boy racers tearing down the Beehive road
Leading out to coastlines
Where kids freeze their lungs
And run amongst the rolling dunes away from everyone

[Chorus]
Oh, leave fast or stay forever
An old man told me to leave fast or stay forever
Leave fast or stay forever

[Verse 2]
Boarded up windows on the promenade
The shells of old nightclubs and halfway houses
Intoxicated people battling on the regular
In a lazy low-lights bar
Poor souls sleeping on shop front doors
Being turfed off by the council
Forgotten by our government
A selfish little baby with no responsibility
Watching people die in the cold
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, leave fast or stay forever
An old man told me to leave fast or stay forever
An old man told me to leave fast or stay forever
Ooh, ooh
