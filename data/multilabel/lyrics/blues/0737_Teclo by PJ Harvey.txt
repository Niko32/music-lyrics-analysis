Long goes the night
Longer the day
Teclo, your death
Will send me to my grave

[Verse 2]
I learned to beg
I learned to pray
Send me his love
Send him to me again

[Chorus]
Let me ride
Let me ride
Let me ride on his grace for a while
Let me ride
Let me ride
Just let me ride on his grace for a while

[Verse 3]
Long goes the night
Longer the day
Teclo, your death
Will send me to my grave

Let me ride
Let me ride
Just let me ride on his grace for a while
Let me ride
Let me ride
Just let me ride on your grace for a while
Just let me ride
