Story of Benny Walker, the greatest hater of all time
(It bought that, bought that)
Oh, what a thing

[Verse 1]
I hate this job I'm working
Now my feet are hurting
I'm tired of talking to strangers all day long
With their dirty faces, they're from far away places
Always cussing and flirting
Are trying to replace usN Oh no!

[Chorus 1]
Everybody needs a bad guy
They need someone to blame
Everybody needs a bad guy (Everybody needs a bad guy)
To point the finger to blame

[Verse 2]
I got fired for nothing
I thought they were just bluffing
I was almost on time, I had so much on my mind
I feel disrespected, I feel so neglected
I’ve got to look on my shoulder (look on my shoulder)
While I'm driving and texting
I tell ya
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Everybody needs a bad guy
So they can feel ok
Everybody needs a bad guy (Everybody needs a bad guy)
So they can have a savior

[Bridge]
They keep holding their back all the time
They keep holding their back all the time
They keep holding their back all the time
I point my finger, I point my finger at you

[Instrumental Bridge + spoken words]
The nigga stay, I’m not staying good, but you’re right
Yeah, watch that shit
We ain’t playing little nigga, Oakland California
Do you hear me? Shit! Uh!

[Chorus 3]
Everybody needs a bad guy
Someone they can point the finger at and blame
Everybody needs a bad guy (Everybody needs a bad guy)
So they can have a savior

[Verse 3]
I hate my wife and my mistress
Now I am so addicted to this prescription pills
Mmmm, they're so delicious
I’m just a victim and I am so suspicious
I need protection, it's my second amendment
[Chorus 4]
Everybody needs a bad guy
They need someone to blame
Everybody needs a bad guy (Everybody needs a bad guy)
They need someone to save them
