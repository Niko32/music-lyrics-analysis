But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my back door some day

Trouble in mind, I'm slow
My poor heart is beating so slow
I never had so much trouble
In my life before, yeah

I'm going down to the river
Gonna get me a rocking chair
If the Lord don't help me
I'm gonna rock away from here

Trouble in mind, I'm blue
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor some day

Trouble in mind, well, I'm blue, yeah
But I won't be blue always
'Cause the sun's gonna shine
In my backdoor some day

Well, I'm going down to the river
Gonna get me a rocking chair
If the Lord don't help me
I'm gonna rock away from here
