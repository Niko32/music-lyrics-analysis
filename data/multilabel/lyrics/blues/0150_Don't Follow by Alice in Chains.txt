Hey, I ain't never coming home
Hey, I'll just wander my own road
Hey, hey, I can't meet you here tomorrow, no
Say goodbye, don't follow
Misery so hollow

[Verse 2: Jerry Cantrell]
Hey, you, you're livin' life full throttle
Hey, you, pass me down that bottle, yeah
Hey, hey, you, you can't shake me 'round now
I get so lost and don't know how, yeah
And it hurts to care, I'm going down

[Verse 3: Layne Staley]
Ooh, forgot my woman, lost my friends
Things I'd done and where I've been
Sleep in sweat, the mirror's cold
See my face, it's growin' old
Scared to death, no reason why
Do whatever to get me by
Think about the things I said
Read the page, it's cold and dead
And take me home
Yeah, take me home, oh oh
Take me home
Take me home, yeah
Take me home
