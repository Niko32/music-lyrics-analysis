Wake up
You're gonna wake up to nothin'
Break up
The break up is comin'
And when your heart is hollow
Another pill to swallow

[Verse 2]
Shake up
Gotta shake up, you’re freezing
Make up
I'm going to make up my reasons
I used to say I need you
But now I gotta leave you

[Chorus]
Sister, sister
What did they do to you
Sister, sister
What did they do to you
Did they take and try to break
A heart that long
It’s so wrong

[Verse 3]
Hung up
Got me hung up in draft
Rung up
Got me rung up in bed
You took advantage of
The one who showed you love
You might also like[Chorus]
Sister, sister
What did they do to you
Sister, sister
What did they do to you
Did they take and try to break
A heart that long
It’s so wrong

[Outro]
It's so long
So long
