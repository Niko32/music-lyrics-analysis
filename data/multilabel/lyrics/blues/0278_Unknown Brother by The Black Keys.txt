Though I never met you and we spoke not a word
I'll never forget you through stories that I've heard
For you, unknown brother, my baby's mother's pained
'Cause your soul is in heaven, but your memory remains

[Chorus]
Unknown, unknown brother
I'll meet you someday
Unknown, unknown brother
We'll walk through fields where children play

[Verse 2]
Your eyes shined bright when you were a kid
Your sisters loved you and all that you did
Big brother, big brother, don't worry a bit
Your flame has not faded since the day it was lit

[Bridge]
Your life was joy
Your mama's only boy
And when the skies are blue
Big brother, they're blue for you

[Verse 3]
We'll smile like pictures of you as a boy
Before you retired to heavenly joy
You might also like[Chorus]
Unknown, unknown brother
I'll meet you someday
Unknown, unknown brother
We will walk through fields where children play
