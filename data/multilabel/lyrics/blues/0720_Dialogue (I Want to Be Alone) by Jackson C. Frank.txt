I want to be alone
I need to touch each stone
Face the grave that I have grown
I want to be alone

[Verse 2]
Before all the days are gone
And darker walls are bent and torn
To pass the time of those who mourn
I want to be alone

[Verse 3]
Rivers that run anywhere
Are in my hand and just up the stair
Past the eyes of those who care
Who can never be alone

[Verse 4]
Changes that were not meant to be
Tow the hours of my memory
Sing a song of love to me
To say you must never
Never be alone

[Verse 5]
The tears of a silent rain
Seek shelter on my broken pain
And run away
But I remain
To speak the words
That sing of alone
You might also like[Verse 1 Refrain]
I want to be alone
I need to touch each stone
Face the grave that I have grown
I want to be alone
