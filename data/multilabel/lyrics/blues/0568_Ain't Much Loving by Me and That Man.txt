Mother, I'm gone
It seems like in this world
There ain't much loving anymore

Mama, I'm leaving
Mama, I'm gone
I ain't looking for redemption
Like a dog without a bone

Ooh, there ain't much loving anymore
Ooh, there ain't much loving anymore
Ooh, there ain't much loving anymore
Ooh, there ain't much loving anymore

Mother, I'm leaving
Mama, I'm gone
I must find a place to rest my spirit where I can sit and mourn

Mama, I'm leaving
Mama, I'm gone
Nothing can fix my broken soul
So I hit an empty road

Ooh, there ain't much loving anymore
Ooh, there ain't much loving anymore
Ooh, there ain't much loving anymore
Ooh, there ain't much loving anymore

Father, I'm leaving
Father, I'm gone
There's a billion years I've traveled
And I finally found my home

I'm gonna sing out my darkness
Sing about my woe
I will spread the gospel
There ain't much loving anymore

Ooh, there ain't much loving anymore
Ooh, there ain't much loving anymore
Ooh, there ain't much loving anymore
Ooh, there ain't much loving anymore
