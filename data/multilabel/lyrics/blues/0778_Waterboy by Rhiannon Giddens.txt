Waterboy, where are you hidin'?
If you don't come right here, I'm gonna tell your pa on you
There ain't no hammer that's on this mountain
That ring like mine, boy, that ring like mine
I'm gonna bust this rock, boy, from here to Macon
All the way to the jail, boy, all the way to the jail

[Verse]
You jack of diamonds, you jack of diamonds
I know you're of old, boy, I know you're of old
You done robbed my pockets, you done robbed my pockets
Silver and gold, boy, silver and gold

[Chorus]
Waterboy, where are you hidin'?
If you don't come right here, I'm gonna tell your pa on you
There ain't no hammer that's on this mountain
That ring like mine, boy, that ring like mine
I'm gonna bust this rock, boy, from here to Macon
All the way to the jail, boy, all the way to the jail

[Outro]
Waterboy, where are you hidin'?
If you don't come right here, if you don't come right here
If you don't come right here, I'm gonna tell your pa on youYou might also like
