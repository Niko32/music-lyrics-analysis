I said that I would never ever love again
But you set my soul on fire
I said no kind of love would ever pull me in
But you set my soul on fire

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I said love came from the East, love came from the West
Love come from the one that loved me the best
Love shot me through my love-proof vest
But you set my soul on fire

Your love set my soul on fire
Your love set my soul on fire
Set my soul on fire

Love came from the one who loved me the best
Love [?] me through my brill-proof vest
And you set my soul on fire
