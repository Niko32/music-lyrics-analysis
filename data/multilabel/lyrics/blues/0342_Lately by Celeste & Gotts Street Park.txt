Don't wanna put on pressure when I'm talking to you
Don't wanna give you lectures but you just got to move
Don't know where we went wrong, hmm
But I know hope's gone for me and for you
They used to envy you and us, I hate what we've become
Running round in circles 'til no air is in my lungs
Cherish what you give me but I need to be free
All this time I'm fighting

[Chorus]
Lately, I've been tied up, lately, I've been lying
Lately, I've been thinking about the ways to shake my life up
Lately, I've been useless, lately, I've been loose
Lately, I'm pushing through
I'll hold my hand tonight if I have to
I'll always pay the price when I'm with you
Oh-oh, lately
Oh-oh, lately

[Verse 2]
Don't wanna build you out 'cause I know you're not that strong
I'll only let you down, I know, I need to be on my own
But I'm never in the right mood when you come to my home
So if you hear the silence please leave your message after the tone
Looking through this
I, I didn't do this, I know
You know how slow time goes, oh, oh
But we stuck through it, this time
You might also like[Chorus]
Lately, I've been tied up, lately, I've been lying
Lately, I've been thinking about the ways to shake my life up
Lately, I've been useless, lately, I've been loose
Lately, I'm pushing through
But I'll hold my hand tonight if I have to
I'll only pay the price when I'm with you
Oh-oh, lately
Oh-oh, lately

[Outro]
