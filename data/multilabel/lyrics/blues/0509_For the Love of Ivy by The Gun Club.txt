You look just like an Elvis from Hell
My heart is broken, so I'm going to Hell
Bury me way down deep in Hell
I'm a steel drivin' man, I want to go to Hell

[Chorus]
Then go tell Ivy, oh-woah
It's for the love of Ivy, yeah-yeah
Well, I did it for Ivy, oh-woah
You're the one

[Verse 2]
I'm gonna buy me a graveyard of my own
And kill everyone who ever done me wrong
I'm gonna buy me a gun just as long as my arm
And kill everyone who ever done me harm

[Chorus]
Yeah, I'm gonna get Ivy, woah-oh
It's for the love of Ivy, yeah, yeah
Go and get Ivy, woah-oh
You're the one

[Interlude]
Take it down, man
Take it way down, come on
Shh

Yeah, jawbone eat and jawbone talk
And jawbone eat you with a knife and fork
I was hunting for niggers down in the dark
Well, all of a sudden I had a better thought

[Chorus]
Let's go hunt Ivy, oh-woah
Let's go get Ivy, yeah-yeah
For the love of Ivy, oh-woah
You're the one

[Bridge]
I did it for Ivy
Just for Ivy
It's for the love of Ivy
I did it for Ivy
Ha ha ha Ivy, ha ha ha Ivy
Ooh, I did it for Ivy
I did it for Ivy, I did it for Ivy
I did it for Ivy, I did it for Ivy
Ooh Ivy, I did it for Ivy, oh, Ivy, oh woo
Ivy
Ivy, Ivy, Ivy, Ivy
I did it for Ivy, I want it, Ivy
I want you Ivy
Come to me, Ivy, come to me, Ivy
I want you, Ivy
Ivy
[Outro]
I was all dressed up like an Elvis from Hell
Hell
Shh-shh-shh-shh-shh-shh, shh, shh
