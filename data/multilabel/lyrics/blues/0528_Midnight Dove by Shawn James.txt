Midnight Dove, why do you wander on through clouded skies?
There must be a glimpse of hope in sight
Spread your wings and take to flight, leave the past behind
The dawn will birth a brand new light
So fly on and never look back from where you came
The sky opens up and it's calling out your name
'Cause all you got is all
All you got is all, all that you need
I found myself, found myself amongst the thorns and weeds
You found yourself, found yourself amongst the beautiful trees
We are not the same, no, we are not the same
No, we are not the same, we are not the same

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I gotta blow like the wind, flow like the sea
Deep down inside of every part of me
My heart's been achin' for the freedom to stretch out my wings
Now, with every move I make and every breath I take
My mind's been worrying about what's at stake
But I just gotta let them go with the wind

[Chorus]
Oh, let it all go, let it all go
Let it all go with the wind
Let it all go, let it all go
Let it all go
