It's true that sometimes intuition ties the blinding folds
To contemplate not what
But why the way the mind will go
Sometimes it plays the heart
It's so lovely at the start
But when the walls come crashing down
I take it all apart
Arise my jaded cynicism, analyzing criticism
Every thought so skeptical
No mysteries are left at all
No silly romance fantasies
Are really how they're hoped to be
No this is not a song of love
Just so damn reminiscent of it all

[Chorus]
Whoow, intention
When you leave these things behind
I can't open up my mind at all
Whoow, intention
Well I know, I know that love ain't real
But I can't deny the way I feel
I'd like to say I'll find the day
When no more will I feel this way
And if I never, very well
But only tests of time can tell
Indulge the moment and then it's gone
But never for too very long
No this is not a song of love
Just so damn reminiscent of it all
You might also like[Verse 2]
The fight to strive, genetic drive
Those early days of man
Replication and survive, to act not understand
For every lost potential mother kills you from within
For fear of life's own preservation starts to settle in
Well I know it gets confusing and I know it's worth a try
When instinct tells you how to act but just won't tell you why
And as single souls are drawn together, passionate and blind
Just keep this simple thought in mind
That love is just a concept for the times

[Chorus]
Whoow, intention
When you leave these things behind
I can't open up my mind at all
Whoow, intention
Well I know, I know that love ain't real
But I can't deny the way I feel
I'd like to say I'll find the day
When no more will I feel this way
And if I never, very well
But only tests of time can tell
Indulge the moment and then it's gone
But never for too very long
No this is not a song of love
Just so damn reminiscent of it all
[Bridge]
Woe and blight, such is life
Though excel for all is well
Woe and blight, such is life
Though excel for all is well

[Outro]
Whoow, intention
When you leave these things behind
I can't open up my mind at all
Whoow, intention
Oh no this is not a song of love
Just so damn reminiscent of it all
