Am I wrong
Fallin' in love with you? Uh
Tell me, am I wrong
Well, fallin' in love with you? Uh
While your other man was out there
Cheatin' and lyin', steppin' all over you

[Verse 1]
Uh, sweet thing
Tell me, am I wrong, uh
Holdin' on to you so tight?
Tell me, tell me, am I wrong
Holdin' on to you so tight? Mm
If your other man come to claim you
He'd better be ready
Ready for a long, long fight, uh

[Verse 2]
Well, I got to be strong, mm
Well, I, I know you're dependin' on me
You know I got to be strong
I know you're dependin' on me
To give you all of my attention
All of my time, and all of the love you need

Oh, tell me, am I wrong
Tryna hold on to you? Uh
Tell me, am I wrong
Tryna hold on to you?
I just wanna make a home for you, baby
And all of your children too

[Chorus]
Tell me, am I wrong
Fallin' in love with you? Uh
You got to tell me, am I wrong
Fallin' in love with you?
While your other man was out there
Cheatin' and lyin', steppin' all over you
While your other man was out there
Cheatin' and lyin', steppin' all over you
