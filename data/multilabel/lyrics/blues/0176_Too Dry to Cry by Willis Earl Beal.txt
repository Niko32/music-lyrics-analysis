Tweed jacket, trucker hat, cup of tea
I'm just sitting at the table thinking about me
With my moccasins on and waiting by my phone
With my half-masked eyes like a tear-less drone
I am the deep down clown, you better throw me a bone
Cause I'll be making that sound, when they leave me alone
With the pots and pans, my voice and my hands
And my spoon drumstick, with this innocuous trance
You got to give me a chance to advance this romance
So when I pick out my 'fro I have a place I can go

[Hook]
No no, don't leave me hanging like a spider with no fly
Cause I've been banging on the walls cause I'm too dry to cry
(x2)

[Verse 2]
Photocopied Xerox pictures of dames
With two dimensional faces make me feel ashamed
So I keep 'em tucked away in a folder that's red
But I don't need to look at them, cause they're stuck in my head
They're what I sniff when I tell you to come right along
In my one-room shack, you know we can't go wrong
I got nine hard inches like a pitchfork prong
So honey lift up your dress and help me sing this song
You might also like[Hook x2]

No no
Ow no
Don't leave me hanging (repeat, fade out)
