[Verse 1]
One summer day
She went away
Gone and left me
She's gone to stay

[Chorus]
She's gone
But I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

[Verse 2]
All the summer
Worked on this farm
Had to take Christmas
In my overalls

[Chorus]
She's gone
But I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world

Going down to the freight yard
Gonna catch me a freight train
Gonna leave this town
Work done got too hard

[Chorus/Outro]
She's gone
But I don't worry
I'm sitting on top of the world
