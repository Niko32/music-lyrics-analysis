I'm on the rock and then I check a stock
I have to run like a fugitive to save the life I live
I'm going to be Iron like a Lion in Zion
I'm going to be Iron like a Lion in Zion
Iron Lion Zion

[Verse]
I'm on the run but I have got no gun
See they want to be the star
So they fighting tribal war
And they saying Iron like a Lion in Zion
Iron like a Lion in Zion
Iron Lion Zion

[Chorus]
I'm on the rock, running and you running
I take a stock, running like a fugitive
I had to run like a fugitive just to save the life I live
I am going to be Iron like a Lion in Zion
I am going to be Iron like a Lion in Zion

[Outro]
Iron Lion Zion, Iron Lion Zion, Iron Lion Zion
Iron like a Lion in Zion, Iron like a lion in Zion
Iron Like a Lion in ZionYou might also like
