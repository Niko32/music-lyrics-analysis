For your love, I'd be your slave
You gotta give me some, yes give me some
Can't you hear me pleading, you've gotta give me some

Said Mr. Jones to old butcher Pete
I want a piece of your good old meat
You gotta give me some, oh give me some
I crave your round steak, you've gotta give me some

Sweet as candy in a candy shop
Is just your sweet, sweet lollipop
You've gotta give me some, please give me some
I love all day suckers, you gotta give me some

To the milkman I heard Mary scream
Said she wanted a lots of cream
You've gotta give me some, oh gimme some
Catch it when you come sir, you gotta give me some

Hear my cryin' on my bended knees
If you wanna put my soul at ease
You've gotta give me some, please gimme some
Can't stand it any longer, you gotta give me some

Sheeper called to camel, sugar lump
Said I'm going crazy about your hump
You've got to give me some, please gimme some
I can't wait eight days, you gotta give me some
You might also likeJay bird said to the peckerwood
I'd like to peck like a pecker should
But gimme some, yes gimme some
I'm crazy about them worms, you've gotta give me some
