If I spent a week without you
Bet you'd wonder what I’d do
I think that I'd start goin' out
Get caught kissin’ other dudes
And it seems you just wanna bring me down, down
With your bad attitude (Bad attitude)
When you know I'm not one to keep dealin' with the shit
That you put me through

[Chorus]
I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
And that's what's got me wondering what it's like
To not have you around

[Verse 2]
If I spent a week without you, hmm
I'd probably have so much fun (Have so much fun)
First things first, I'd gather up all my girls, yeah (Yeah)
So we can lay out in the sun
Oh, it’d be so nice not to worry, yeah
How I’d love not to stress
I'd go and grab my old blue jeans
I’m sick of wearing this silly dress
You might also like[Chorus]
I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
And that's what's got me wondering what it's like
To not have you around

[Bridge]
You know I’d miss you, babe
Feels like I've known you since I was just 7 years old
You used to make me smile, but now you don't do that anymore
It feels like I'm always just crying and sleeping alone
But when I think of you gone, I know

[Chorus]
I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
I don't want to wonder what it's like
To not have you around

[Post-Chorus]
To not have you around
To not have you around
To not have you around
To not have you around

[Outro]
You know I'd miss you, babe
You know I'd miss you, babe
You know I'd miss you, babe
(Know I'd miss you, know I'd miss you, oh)
