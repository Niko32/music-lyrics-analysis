Well I walked over the bridge
Into the city where I live
And I saw my old landlord
Well we both said, "Hello"
There was nowhere else to go
'Cause his rent I couldn't afford

[Verse 2]
Well relationships change
Though I think it's kind of strange
How money makes a man grow
Ah, some people they claim
If you get enough fame
You live over the rainbow, over the rainbow

[Verse 3]
But the people on the street
Out on buses or on feet
We all got the same blood flow
Oh in society every dollar got a deed
We all need a place that we can go
And feel over the rainbow

[Chorus]
But sometimes we forget what we got
Who we are or who we are not
I think we got a chance to make it right
Keep it loose, keep it tight
Keep it tight

I'm in love with a girl who's in love with the world
Though I can't help but follow
Though I know someday she is bound to go away
And stay over the rainbow
Got to learn how to let her go
Over the rainbow

[Chorus]
But sometimes we forget who we got
Who they are or who they are not
There is so much more in love than black and white
Keep it loose child, gotta keep it tight
Keep it loose child, keep it tight
Keep it tight
Keep it tight, yeah
