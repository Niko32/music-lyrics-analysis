When you kiss me in the morning
Then you should call me late at night
I never tell you what I'm thinking
And, yet, you always seem to get it right
Now I've been loving what you're giving
It never stays away from right
So if you kiss me in the morning
Oh, you better call tonight

[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
And I wake up with this feeling
And my body aches for you
And I know in my heart, this is one I can't part with
I'm so by your side, that's the truth

[Verse 2: Jorja Smith]
So, kiss me in the morning
And call me late at night
I never tell you what I'm thinking
And, yet, you always seem to get it right
Are your lips waiting to be on my skin?
Are your hands longing to hold me tight?
'Cause, baby, I'm here just for the wanting
But you have got to show up here tonight
You might also like[Chorus: Jorja Smith]
And I wake up with this feeling
And my body aches for you
And I know in my heart, this is one I can't part with
I'm so by your side, that's the truth

[Outro: Jorja Smith]
I'll keep singing on this bed-stand
And every evening to get it right
So if you kiss me in the morning
Though you might not call me
Don't you, "baby doll" me
You better call me tonight
