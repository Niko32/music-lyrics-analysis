You're over my shoulder, I think I'm possessed
Your constant undertone, is making me toothless
Timeâ€™s come to trim you, gonna get out my knife
Gonna cut you out, baby, out of my life

[Chorus: Albert Bouchard]
(Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil)
I love you like sin, but I won't be your pigeon
(Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil)
I love you like sin, but I won't be your pigeon

[Verse 2: Albert Bouchard]
The power that I give you, I'm so sick of your voice
In my body, you don't give me no choice
But to boot you, honey, to give you the shove
So take back your despot, I'll keep your love

[Chorus: Albert Bouchard]
(Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil)
I love you like sin, but I won't be your pigeon
(Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil)
I love you like sin, but I won't be your pigeon

I'm searching by symbols, looking for a pistol
To laser you out, it looks like a keyhole
I'll just stick my key back, seamless and whole
No more idols, got my own self control

[Chorus: Albert Bouchard]
(Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil)
I love you like sin, but I won't be your pigeon
(Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil)
I love you like sin, but I won't be your pigeon

[Outro: Albert Bouchard]
(Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil)
I love you like sinful love
(Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil)
I love you like sinful love
(Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil)
I love you like sinful love
(Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil)
I love you like sinful love
(Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil)
I love you, I love you like sinful love
(Dare-devil, she-devil, printer's-devil, evil)
I love you like sinful love
