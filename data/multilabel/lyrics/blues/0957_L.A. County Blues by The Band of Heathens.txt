Well I was never one for compromise
I couldn't fit at school
Gonzo by the seventh grade
I played 'em all the fool
Yeah I couldn't find shoes my size
Had to walk ten miles
There's blisters on the backs of my soles
And an illegal smile

[Chorus]
We're burning down Las Vegas Town
Had to sleep by noon
Drank my money on a red roulette
That's a ride you can't refuse
Five hours down with a sunrise frown
Lightning in your shoes
It's one foot in the ether
With the L.A. County blues

[Verse 2]
Yeah they got me on accessory
Thirty days in jail
One headlight in a Louisville night
Without a chance at bail
But I'll be home by derby time
So please save me a seat
Mint Juleps on the outfield grass
The old south tastes so sweet
You might also like[Chorus]
We're burning down Las Vegas Town
Had to sleep by noon
Drank my money on a red roulette
That's a ride you can't refuse
Five hours down with a sunrise frown
Lightning in your shoes
It's one foot in the ether
With the L.A. County blues

[Verse 3]
Well you can call me Mr. Raoul Duke
I'll know what you mean
Blinded by a quart of rum
And a dose of mescaline
The Mint 400 couldn't slow me down
I kinda like the speed
We're the failure of our generation
For a couple bags of weed

[Chorus]
We're burning down Las Vegas Town
Had to sleep by noon
Drank my money on a red roulette
That's a ride you can't refuse
Five hours down with a sunrise frown
Lightning in your shoes
It's one foot in the ether
With the L.A. County blues
Yeah it's one foot in the ether
With the L.A. County blues
