Those who've gone above
Friends that they've lost
People they love

The me down the road
To lead me through the fog

Seen from above
Thread of design
Don't trip me up

[Chorus]
Children
Take or leave it
Come, people
You got to give a little, get a little
And see it
Like future you people
You might also like[Bridge]

Imagine the sound
And listen loud
And then you'll reach that top
