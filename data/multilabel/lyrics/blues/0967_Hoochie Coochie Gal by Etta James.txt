Before I was born
You got a girl child's comin'
She's gonna be a son of a gun
She gonna make all the men
Jump and shout
Then the world gotta know
What this all about
But you know I'm her
Everybody knows I'm her
I'm your hoochie coochie girl
Everybody knows I'm her
I got a black cat bone
I got a mojo too
I got the Johnny conkeroo
I'm gonna mess with you
I'm gonna make you mens
Lead me by my hand
Then the world will know
I'm the hoochie coochie gal
But you know I'm her
Everybody knows I'm her
Oh you know I'm the hoochie coochie girl
Everybody knows I'm her
Yes, I am
On the seventh hours
On the seventh day
On the seventh month
The seven doctors say
She was born for good luck
And that you'll see
I got seven hundred dollars
Don't you mess with me
'Cause I'm her
Everybody knows I'm her
Well you know I'm the hoochie coochie gal
Everybody knows I'm her
I'm her
Everybody knows I'm her
Say, I'm her!
Everybody knows I'm here
I'm the hoochie coochie girlYou might also like
