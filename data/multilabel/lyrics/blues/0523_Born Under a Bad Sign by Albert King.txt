Born under a bad sign
Been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
You know, I wouldn't have no luck at all

[Verse 1]
Hard luck and trouble
Been my only friend
I've been on my own
Ever since I was ten

[Chorus]
Born under a bad sign
Been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
You know, I wouldn't have no luck at all

[Verse 2]
I can't read
I didn't know how to write
My whole life has been
One big fight

[Chorus]
Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I say, I wouldn't have no luck at all
You might also like[Bridge]
That ain't lie, ah, oh
You know, if it wasn't for bad luck
I wouldn't have no kinda luck
If it wasn't for real bad luck
I wouldn't have no luck at all

[Verse 3]
You know wine and women
Is all I crave
A big legged woman
Gonna carry me to my grave

[Chorus]
Born under a bad sign
I've been down since I began to crawl
If it wasn't for bad luck
I tell ya, I wouldn't have no luck at all

[Outro]
Yeah, I'm a bad luck boy
Been havin' bad luck all of my days, yes
