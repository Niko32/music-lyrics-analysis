You never know how much I love ya
Never know how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a feelin' that's so hard to bear

[Chorus]
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
Fever all through the night

[Verse 2]
Listen to me, baby
Hear every word I say
No one can love you the way I do
'Cause they don't know how to love you my way

[Chorus]
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
And fever all through the night
You might also like[Verse 3]
Bless my soul, I love you
Take this heart away
Take these arms I'll never use
And just believe in what my lips have to say

[Chorus]
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the mornin'
And fever all through the night

[Verse 4]
Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
My eyes light up when you call my name
'Cause I know you're gonna treat me right

[Chorus]
You give me fever
When you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever (Fever, burn through) in the mornin'
And fever all through the night
[Outro]
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mm
Mmm-umm-umm-um-um
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mm-mmm-mm
Mmm-umm-umm-um-um
