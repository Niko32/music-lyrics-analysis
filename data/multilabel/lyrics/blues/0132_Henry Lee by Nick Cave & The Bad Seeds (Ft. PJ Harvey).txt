Get down, get down, little Henry Lee
And stay all night with me
You won't find a girl in this damn world
That will compare with me

[Pre-Chorus: PJ Harvey & Nick Cave]
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow

[Chorus: Nick Cave & PJ Harvey]
La la la la la
La la la la lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee

[Verse 2: Nick Cave]
I can't get down and I won't get down
And stay all night with thee
For the girl I have in that merry green land
I love far better than thee

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Cave & PJ Harvey]
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow

[Chorus: Nick Cave & PJ Harvey]
La la la la la
La la la la lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
You might also like[Verse 3: Nick Cave]
She leaned herself against a fence
Just for a kiss or two
And with a little pen-knife held in her hand
She plugged him through and through

[Pre-Chorus: Nick Cave & PJ Harvey]
And the wind did roar and the wind did moan

[Chorus: Nick Cave & PJ Harvey]
La la la la la
La la la la lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee

[Verse 4: PJ Harvey]
Come take him by his lily-white hands
Come take him by his feet
And throw him in this deep deep well
Which is more than one hundred feet

[Pre-Chorus: PJ Harvey & Nick Cave]
And the wind did howl and the wind did blow

[Chorus: Nick Cave & PJ Harvey]
La la la la la
La la la la lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
[Verse 5: PJ Harvey]
Lie there, lie there, little Henry Lee
Till the flesh drops from your bones
For the girl you have in that merry green land
Can wait forever for you to come home

[Pre-Chorus: PJ Harvey & Nick Cave]
And the wind did howl and the wind did moan

[Chorus: Nick Cave & PJ Harvey]
La la la la la
La la la la lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
La la la la la
La la la la lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
La la la la la
La la la la lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
La la la la la
La la la la lee
A little bird lit down on Henry Lee
