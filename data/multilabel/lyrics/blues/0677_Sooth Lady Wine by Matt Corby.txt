You sold me out to the man (to the man, to the man)
With the nuclear plan in his hands
But he don't understand
The free world, and its demands

[Verse 1]
Oh we're lost
Get it together
Get it to the seventh state
With you; on tomorrow's ideas
I am more than terrified to care
So no where’s out of bounds
Here or there

[Chorus]
You sold me out to the man (to the man, to the man)
With the nuclear plan in his hands
But he don't understand
The free world, and its demands

[Verse 2]
If you feel alright
Let yourself dance
Don't sit out tonight
If you feel the right
Get off your phone
Take it in tonight
If you see the light
Don't turn away
It's reality
With no fear in sight
We can begin to feel the happiness
You might also like[Bridge]
Sooth lady wine
Don’t sigh
Not in the way that I indulge in life
One new battle, two new battles
Try for something new
I wanted so long to write it down
For no one to decode

[Outro]
If you feel alright
Let yourself dance
Don't sit out tonight
If you feel alright
Get off your phone
Take it in tonight
If you see the light
Don't turn away
It's reality
With no fear in sight
We can begin to feel the happiness
