You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You can wag your tail
But I ain't gonna feed you no more

[Verse 1]
You told me you was high class
But I could see through that
Yes, you told me you was high class
But I could see through that
And daddy I know
You ain't no real cool cat

[Chorus]
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You're just a old hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You can wag your tail
But I ain't gonna feed you no more

[Guitar Solo]
Oh, play that thing, boy!
Aw listen, isn't that them old hound dog? (Oh-woo!)
Oh, play it, it's all right up here
And listen to that old hound dog howl (Ooo-wo!)
You might also likeOh, play it boy, play it
Oh, you make me feel good
Oh, do not mess around any longer daddy
Now wag your tail

Oh, get it
Oh, get it now, get it, get it, get it
Oh, you old hound dog

[Verse 2]
You made me feel so blue
You made me weep and moan
You made me feel so blue
Yeah you made me weep and moan
Cause you ain't looking for a woman
All you're lookin' is for a home

[Chorus]
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Been snoopin' 'round my door
You can wag your tail
But I ain't gonna feed you no more

[Outro]
Awoo!
(Bark, bark, bark, bark!)
