Well the night has gone
And the shadows clear
When I hear my song
Will the grave be near?

[Verse 2]
See what you want
But I’m the rising tide
I’m no force of god
I'm a thousand lives

[Verse 3]
I take what I want
'Cause I’m the frightening sky
I’m a selfish man
Designed to die

[Chorus]
But is it heaven up there?
Is it heaven up there?
Is it heaven up there?
'Cause it’s hell down here

[Verse 4]
Believe in existence spent
To separate us from them
To know that your blood runs thin
Is to live with the truth within
You might also like[Verse 5]
So scrape up the bruise I wear
And eradicate all my fears
Prepare me to walk these stairs
I don’t know what my future is
I don't know what my future is

[Chorus]
Is it heaven up there?
Is it heaven up there?
Is it heaven up there?
Is it heaven up there?

[Verse 6]
Say I’ve been blind
For the use of my time
Wanna be a better man
On the ground where I stand

[Verse 7]
There’s something out there
Just know that I’ve cared
Do this side by side
Motion with the tide

[Chorus]
Is it heaven up there?
Is it heaven up there?
Is it heaven up there?
'Cause it’s hell down here
Yes it’s hell down here
[Outro]
Is this heaven up there?
I know there's heaven up there
I know there's heaven up there
Yes there is heaven up there
