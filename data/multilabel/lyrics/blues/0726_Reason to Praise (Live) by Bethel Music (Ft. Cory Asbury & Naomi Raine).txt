When I'm at my end, You're just getting started
When I hit a wall, You just walk through
When I face a mountain, You are the maker
So it's gotta move

[Verse 2: Cory Asbury]
When I'm out of faith, You are still faithful
When I'm at my worst, You are still good
In all of my questions, You are the answer
It all points to You

[Chorus: Cory Asbury]
'Cause You're the God of the breakthrough when I'm breaking down
You'll be working a way through when there's no way out
This one thing I know
That You're still on Your throne
So whatever I'm feeling, I've still got a reason to praise (Help me say)

[Post-Chorus: Cory Asbury, Naomi Raine]
Praise
Praise, yeah (Mm-mm)

[Verse 3: Naomi Raine, Naomi Raine & Cory Asbury]
Out of our wrongs, You write our story
And out of the cross, come rivers of grace
And out of the grave, bursts a revival
No tomb can contain, oh

When You come around, dry bones come to life
Deserts to paradise
Stones just start rolling away
When You come around, my heart starts to beat again
Lungs stretch to breathe You in
Souls just erupt into praise
