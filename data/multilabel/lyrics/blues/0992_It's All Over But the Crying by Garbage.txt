Everything you think you know, baby, is wrong
And everything you think you had, baby, is gone

[Pre-Chorus]
Certain things turn ugly when you think too hard
And nagging little thoughts change into things you can't turn off
Everything you think you know baby, is wrong

[Chorus]
It's all over but the crying
Fade to black, I'm sick of trying
Took too much and now I'm done
Oh, it's all over but the crying

[Verse 2]
Do you really think I'm made of stone? Baby, c'mon!
That we only love the things we own? Baby, you're wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Certain things just happen when you make no plans
And love can really tear you up and it can break you down
Everything you think you know, baby, is wrong

[Chorus]
It's all over but the crying
Fade to black, I'm sick of trying
Took too much and now I'm done
Oh, it's all over but the crying
You might also like[Bridge]
Baby, we're done
If I could, I would, I'd change everything
'Cause I can't forget you, though you don't believe me
Now I can't walk back, I can't leave behind
Where does it go, all the light that we had?

[Verse 3]
Everything you think you know, baby, is wrong
And everything you think you had, baby, is gone

[Outro]
Oh baby, we're done (Baby, we're done)
Baby, we're done (Baby, we're done)
Baby, we're done (Baby, we're done)
Baby, we're done (Baby, we're done)
Oh baby, we're done (Baby, we're done)
Baby, we're done (Baby, we're done)
Oh baby, we're done
