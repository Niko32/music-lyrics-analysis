[Chorus]
Oh, the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh, the way we wrap it is wrong

[Verse 1]
Fuck all of that plastic (Fuck all of that plastic)
Wrapped up in my dinner (Wrapped up in my dinner)
It's not fantastic (It's not fantastic)
It's gonna come and kill us (It's gonna come and kill us)
It's gonna be massive (It's gonna be massive)
It's gonna be brutal (It's gonna be brutal)
Death will come from plastic (Death will come from plastic)
Death will come from people (Death will come from people)

[Chorus]
Oh, the way we wrap it is wrong
Oh, the way we wrap it is wrong

[Verse 2]
Fuck all of those plastic (Fuck all of those plastic)
Particles in the ocean (Particles in the ocean)
It's like a vendetta (It's like a vendetta)
Against our Mother Nature (Against our Mother Nature)
