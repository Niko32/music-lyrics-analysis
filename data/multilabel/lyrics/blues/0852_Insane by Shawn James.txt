Lately, I've been thinking that everyone's insane
Lost their minds out in the world and now look who's to blame
Themselves, they just can't see that
So pack your bags and leave the past, let's go for a ride
The wind and water carry us they will be our guides
Tonight, we'll just sail free

[Chorus]
The moon will light our path through these darkest seas, I'm sure
And all the world will stare and wonder where we'll go

[Verse 2]
Have you ever thought of leaving everything you've ever loved?
Starting over someplace inexplicably unknown
And oh, that's what I crave
It's the thrill that keeps me going, puts a gleam on in my eyes
I venture just to conquer a new monstrous enterprise
And oh, the world is my stage

[Chorus]
Well, maybe someday you'll see how it all makes sense to me
And then you'll jump on board and we can sail the seven seasYou might also like
