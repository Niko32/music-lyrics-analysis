Sometimes when I closed
I see the world from a bigger size
But I never seem to realize
What happens when my life is done?
What began, what must end
I try to find and comprehend
But in the end
I just pretend
What happens when I'm gone?
When my life is done?

[Verse 1]
Some songs are happy
And some songs are sad
Some songs are really well rehearsed
And other songs are bad
And some songs are angry
And some songs are sweet
Some songs are made to help you wake up in the morning
Well, here's a little song to help you go back to sleep

[Chorus]
There isn't any God and when you die, you're just dead
And heaven's just a fairytale to put you to bed
Sometimes I think about the chance that I'm wrong
And then I close my eyes and just remember this song
I said, there isn't any God and when you die, you're just dead
And heaven's just a fairytale to put you to bed
There ain't nobody watching us, 'cause nobody cares
And in the end we're living all alone

If I could live forever
I'd do it, if I could
Leave it all behind, everything that I've done
It's just as bad as if it never begun
And if I was a believer
And, Lord knows, I've tried
I could be at peace when I close my eyes
And I could go to heaven on the day that I die

[Chorus]
But there isn't any God and when you die, you're just dead
And heaven's just a fairytale to put you to bed
Sometimes I think about the chance that I'm wrong
And then I close my eyes and just remember this song
I said, there isn't any God and when you die, you're just dead
And heaven's just a fairytale to put you to bed
There ain't nobody watching us, 'cause nobody cares
And in the end we're living all alone

[Bridge]
Love don't matter 'cause you die in the end
And money don't matter 'cause you die in the end
And life doesn't matter 'cause you die in the end
But it's really never over, no, it's really never over
[Chorus]
There isn't any God and when you die, you're just dead
And heaven's just a fairytale to put you to bed
Sometimes I think about the chance that I'm wrong
And then I close my eyes and just remember this song
I said, there isn't any God and when you die, you're just dead
And heaven's just a fairytale to put you to bed
There ain't nobody watching us, 'cause nobody cares
And in the end we're living all alone
