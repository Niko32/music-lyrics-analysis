Quasheba, Quasheba
You're free now, you're free now
How does your spirit fly?
Blood of your blood
Bone of your bone
By the grace of your strength we have life

[Verse 1]
From the Golden Coast of Ghana
To the bondage of Grenada
You kept the dream of hope alive
They burned your body
They cursed your blackness
But they could not take your lights

[Chorus]
Quasheba, Quasheba
You're free now, you're free now
How does your spirit fly?
Blood of your blood
Bone of your bone
By the grace of your strength we have life

[Verse 2]
Raped and beaten, your babies taken
Starved and sold and sold again
Ain't you a woman, of love deserving
Ain't it somethin' you survived?
You might also like[Chorus]
Quasheba, Quasheba
You're free now, you're free now
How does your spirit fly?
Blood of your blood
Bone of your bone
By the grace of your strength we have life

[Verse 3]
You dreamt of home, you dreamt of freedom
You died a slave, you died alone
You came from warriors who once built empires
Ashanti's kingdom carries on

[Chorus]
Quasheba, Quasheba
You're free now, you're free now
How does your spirit fly?
Blood of your blood
Bone of your bone
By the grace of your strength we have life

[Verse 4]
You were forgotten, almost forsaken
Your children founded generations
Your strength sustained them
They won their freedom
Traced their roots to find you [waiting?]
[Chorus]
Quasheba, Quasheba
You're free now, you're free now
How far your spirit's flown
Blood of your blood
Bone of your bone
By the grace of your strength we are home

[Outro]
Blood of your blood
Bone of your bone
By the grace of your strength we are home
By the grace of your strength we are home
We are home
We are home
We are home
