A beautiful face 'til there's love for me in it
Give me your heart and baby I'll bid it
'Cause I always kill the things I love

Some folk would die for the sake of another
Lay down their life for their sisters and brothers
For me, sacrifice is something quite other
'Cause I love to kill the things I love

The look in your eyes will turn to surprise
As you feel the pain and you realize
The one hurting you is somebody who
Once said "I love you"

Somebody we'll pay back all we've borrowed
What we loved today we'll lose tomorrow
But I won't need to wait for my share of sorrow
Because I always kill the things I love

But I won't need to wait for my share of sorrow
Because I already killed the things I love
The things I love
The things I loveYou might also like
