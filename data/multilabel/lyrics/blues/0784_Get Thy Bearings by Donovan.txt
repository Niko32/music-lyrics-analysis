Get your bearing
Know your time
Don't you worry
Weather's fine

[Chorus]
All the world knows
What I'm saying
All the world knows
What I'm saying
The world knows fine well

[Saxophone Solo]

[Verse 2]
Get together
Work it out
Simplicity
Is what it's about

[Chorus]
All the world knows
What I'm saying
All the world knows
What I'm saying
World knows fine wellYou might also like
