You gotta love someone

[Verse 1]
I don't know what you’ve been told
Or what they say about me
I never give up, but give it a rest
I ain't got time to worry 'bout a mess
And I’m kinda getting tired of dealin' with all your stress
I'm startin' to think you have no heart, yeah
You don't even have a soul
You always give in or ya try too late
All I do is give and all you do is take
I'm tired of protecting you from what you need to know (Come on)

[Chorus]
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and movin' on
Hey, yeah

[Verse 2]
I’m not sure I’d even go
'Cause I made your house my home
It’s come to an end, I hate how it's been
Lights are getting dim and the walls are caving in
And it's time for this queen to go and find another throne
When I give it up, I give it all
I went and made you my life
Don't you dare say I don’t care
When I need you most, you know you're never there
It'd be a cold day in hell before I'd ever be your wife, that's right
You might also like[Chorus]
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and moving on

[Bridge]
Kickin' off my shoes and runnin' towards the sun
I said "Nothing's really worth it unless you're having fun"
To make somebody stay
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

[Chorus]
Ever since the day that I met you
I knew you weren't the one
But nothing ever stops me from forgetting
Packing all my shit and moving on

[Outro]
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
