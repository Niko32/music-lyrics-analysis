The flames lick at my feet
Their hearts full of hate
What they don't understand, they condemn
What they can't comprehend must meet its end

[Chorus]
But I won't scream, won't give them that satisfaction
No, I won't confess my false interaction
As I breathe deep and prepare for my passing
I hear them chant, burn the witch

[Verse 2]
I stand accused of bein' in league with Satan
No proof for the false accusation
Tied to the stake, no hope of escape
I stand alone and embrace my fiery fate

[Chorus]
But I won't scream, won't give them that satisfaction
No, I won't confess my false interaction
As I breathe deep and prepare for my passing
I hear them chant, burn the witch
Oh, I won't scream, won't give them that satisfaction
I won't confess my false interaction
Now as I breathe deep and prepare for my passing
I hear them chant, burn the witch
You might also like[Outro]
Burn the witch, burn the witch
Burn the witch, burn the witch
