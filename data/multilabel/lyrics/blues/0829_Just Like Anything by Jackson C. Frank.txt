Just like anything, to sing, to sing, to sing
Is a state of mind

[Verse 1]
Sunlight dances slowly on a drum beatâ€™s broken rhyme
I speak in answers only to see them in my mind
If I had a penny, I'd throw it in the sea
To see if it would float away or grow a penny tree

[Verse 2]
I play the fool of rhythm, to speak of what is sane
I never think of singing to those who feel the same
See how high the rain falls, see the color in my hair
Hunt for golden porridge bowls, hear the paper tear

[Chorus]
Just like anything, to sing, to sing, to sing
Is a state of mind

[Outro]
Death gives no reason, so why should I
Death has no season, so I know I'll never die

[Chorus]
Just like anything, to sing, to sing, to sing
Is a state of mindYou might also like
