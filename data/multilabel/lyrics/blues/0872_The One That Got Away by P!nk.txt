One, two, buckle my show
Mmm, yeah
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
I stood by the exit door of the hotel café
He was playin' with his band
I've always been a sucker
Had a weakness for a boy with a guitar and a drink in his hand
His words were like heaven in my hurricane
My knees buckled under
I thought everyone was watching me
Watching you save my life with the song

[Pre-Chorus]
You were mine
In the back of my mind
Oh, just for one night
Just for a while

[Chorus]
There's always one that gets away
The one that sneaks up on you then slips away

[Verse 2]
Said two weeks later I was sitting in his apartment
He was making cappuccino
I said, "What kind of man makes cappuccino?"
We laughed, we laughed, we laughed
We laughed 'til tears ran down my face
Oh, but my man, you're someone else's man
And that ain't the man that I wanna want
But you keep drawin' me in with those big brown lyin' eyes
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
But you'll always be mine
In the back of my mind
Oh, we had a night
Just a little while

[Chorus]
There's always one that gets away, mm
The one that sneaks up on you then slips away

[Bridge]
In a closed off corner of my heart, yeah, yes
I'll always see your face
The one that got away (The one that got away)
The one that got away (The one that got away)
Oh, the one that got away (The one that got away)
Oh, the one that got away (The one that got away)
Oh, the one that got away
Yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
Ooh

[Verse 3]
I'm not a victim of clichés
I don't believe in soul mates
Happy endings, only one
Oh, and I met you and all that changed
I had a taste and you're still sitting on the tip of my tongue
[Pre-Chorus]
But you were mine
Somewhere in time
I'll look for you first
In my next life

[Chorus]
There's always one that gets away
The one that sneaks up on you then slips away (Slips away)

[Outro]
In a closed off corner of my heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I, I'll always see your face
The one that got away (The one that got away)
The one that got away (The one that got away)
Oh, the one that got away (The one that got away)
Oh, the one that got away (The one that got away)
The one that got away
Yeah, yeah (Yeah)
Oh, oh, yeah
The one that got away, mm
