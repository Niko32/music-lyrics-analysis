I got a man I love
I got a man I like
Every time I fuck them mens
I give 'em the doggone clap
Oh, baby
Give 'em the doggone clap
But that's the kind of pussy that they really like

[Verse 2]
I told him I got a good cock
And it's got four damn good names
Rough top, rough cock
Tough cock, cock without a bone
You can fuck my cock or suck my cock
Or leave my cock alone
Oh, baby
Honey, I piss all night long
You can fuck my cock or suck my cock
Baby, until the cows come home

[Verse 3]
You know both of my mens
They are tight like that
They got a great big dick just like a baseball bat
Ooh, fuck me
Do it to me all night long
I want you to do it to me, baby
Honey, 'til the cows come home
You might also like[Verse 4]
They know I'm a bitch from Baltimore
I got hairs on my cock that will sweep the floor
I've got spunk from them hairs that will shut the door
And I look over your hands seein' I'm a bitch from Baltimore
Oh, talkin' 'bout a bitch from Baltimore
And I got hairs on my cock, sweep anybody's floor

[Verse 5]
I got a big fat belly
I got a big broad ass
And I can fuck any man
With real good class
Talking 'bout fuckin
Talking 'bout grindin', baby, all night long
And I can do it to you, honey
Until the cows come home

[Verse 6]
If you suck my pussy
Baby, I'll suck your dick
I'll do it to you, honey, 'til I make you shit
Oh, baby
Honey, do it all night long
Do it to me, papa
Grace me a verse 'til tomorrow comes
