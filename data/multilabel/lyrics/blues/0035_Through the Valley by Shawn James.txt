I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
And I'll fear no evil because I'm blind to it all
And my mind and my gun, they comfort me
Because I know I'll kill my enemies when they come

[Verse 2]
Surely goodness and mercy will follow me all the days of my life
And I will dwell on this earth forevermore
Still, I walk beside the still waters, and they restore my soul
But I can't walk on the path of the right because I'm wrong

[Verse 3]
Well, I came upon a man at the top of a hill
Called himself the savior of the human race
Said he come to save the world from destruction and pain
But I said, "How can you save the world from itself?"

[Outro]
'Cause I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
And I'll fear no evil because I'm blind
Oh, and I walk beside the still waters, and they restore my soul
But I know when I die, my soul is damnedYou might also like
