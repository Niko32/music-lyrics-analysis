I got the key to the highway
And I'm billed out and bound to go
I'm gonna leave here runnin'
'Cause walkin' is most too slow

[Verse 2]
I'm goin' down on the border
Now, where I'm better known
'Cause, woman, you don't do nothin'
But drive a good man 'way from home

[Verse 3]
Now, when the moon peeps over the mountain
I'll be on my way
Now, I'm gonna walk this old highway
Until the break of day

[Harmonica Solo]

[Verse 4]
Run here, sweet mama
Now, and help me with this heavy load
I am due in West Texas
And I've got to get on the road
You might also like[Verse 5]
I'm goin' to West Texas
I'm goin' down behind the sun
I'm gonna ask the Good Lord
"What evil have I done?"
