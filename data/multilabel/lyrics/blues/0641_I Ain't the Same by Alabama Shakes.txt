Well, I've been going through the motions
Wonder if anyone can see
That I been looking for something
Have you been looking for me?

[Chorus]
I ain't the same, no more
In fact, I have changed from before
No, you ain't gonna find me
Oh no, 'cause I'm not who I used to be

[Verse 2]
Well, I used to be a little girl
Just a smiling, feeling free
I wasn't worried about nobody
Nobody worried 'bout me

[Chorus]
But, I ain't the same, no more
You'll find I have changed from before
No, you ain't gonna find me
Oh no, 'cause I ain't who I used to be

I said I'd never grow old
I can't remember how that used to be
I find myself without the power
I find myself without the glory

[Chorus]
Listen, I ain't the same, no more
You'll find I have changed from before
You ain't gonna find me
Oh no, 'cause I'm not who I used to be
Oh, no, no, I ain't who I used to be
Oh, no, no, I ain't who I used to be
Oh, no...
