Snatch it back and hold it
Baby one more time
I ain't doing too bad, baby
I got you on my mind
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
You having a darn good time

[Verse 2]
Somebody help me
I can't help myself
Somebody got to help me
'Cause I can't help myself
I'm not doing too bad, baby
You know
I ain't got no brand new bag

[Verse 3]
Somebody help me
I can't help myself
Somebody better help me
'Cause I can't help myself
And I ain't doin' too bad, baby
And I ain't got no brand new bag

[Verse 4]
Snatch it back and hold it
I wanna tell you where it's at
All the kids in the neighborhood
They're doing a brand new dance
Snatch it back and hold it
I wanna show you where it's at
