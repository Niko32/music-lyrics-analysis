Na-na, na-na
Na-na, na, na-na
Na-na (Woah-oh-oh), na-na (Oh-oh-oh)
Na-na (Oh-oh-oh), na-na

[Verse 1]
So long
Why you waiting so long?
After every single word is said
I'm feeling dead and gone
Along
Don't you drag me along
If you do, you know I'll follow you
Until the truth is known

[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere you go (Oh oh oh)
I'll go anywhere you go (Oh oh oh)
All the way, all the way
I'll go anywhere you go (Oh oh oh)
I'll go anywhere you go (Oh oh oh)
All the way, all the way

[Verse 2]
So long
Why'd it take you so long?
Every time I hear the whistle blow
I'm down below, your pawn
"Don't call me, I'll call you"
Is what you say, I'll obey
'Till tonight, oh it ain't right
I need to say, gotta say
You might also like[Chorus]
I'll go anywhere you go (Oh oh oh)
I'll go anywhere you go (Oh oh oh)
All the way, all the way
I'll go anywhere you go (Oh oh oh)
I'll go anywhere you go (Oh oh oh)
All the way, all the way

[Outro]
Na-na

Na-na (Woah-oh-oh)
Na-na (Woah-oh-oh)
Na-na, Na-na
Na-na (Woah-oh-oh)
Na-na (Woah-oh-oh)
Na-na (Woah-oh-oh)
Na-na, Na-na
