Let's go driftin' through the trees
Let's go sailing on the sea
Let's go dancing on the juke-joint floor
And leave our troubles all behind, and have a party

[Pre-Chorus]
So easily forgotten, are the most important things
Like the melody and the moonlight in your eyes
And a song that lasts forever
Keeps on getting better all the time

[Chorus]
Life is beautiful, life is wondrous
Every star above is shining just for us
Life is beautiful, on a stormy night
Somewhere in the world the sun is shining bright

[Verse 2]
I get crazy, so afraid
That I might lose you one fine day
And I'll be nothing but a tired old man
And I don't wanna be without you at the party

[Pre-Chorus]
So easily forgotten, the most important thing
Is that I love you, I do
And I want to spend my days and nights
Walking through this crazy world with you
You might also like[Chorus]
Life is beautiful, life is wondrous
Every star above is shining just for us
Life is beautiful, on a stormy night
Somewhere in the world the sun is shining bright

[Instrumental Mandolin Interlude]

[Pre-Chorus]
So easily forgotten, the most important thing
Is that I love you, I do
And I want to spend my days and nights
Walking through this crazy world with you
(That's right baby)

[Chorus]
Life is beautiful, life is wondrous
Every star above is shining just for us
Life is beautiful, on a stormy night
Somewhere in the world the sun is shining
Shining bright
