I've let the sun set three hundred sixty-five times
With murder running deep in my heart
If I didn't directly pull the trigger
I sure as hell played my own part

[Pre-Chorus]
You know that it's a snake eat snake world
We slither and serpentine through
We all took a bite and six thousand years later
This apple's getting harder to chew

[Chorus]
'Cause tonight, boys, we're eating like kings
'Cause we've all tasted death too much it seems
Yeah, tonight, boys, we're eating like kings

[Verse 2]
Yeah, it's been a few years and a couple hundred sunsets
Since I fired a rifle in rage
A dozen leather couches and substance filled pouches
Still, I can't fully turn the page

[Pre-Chorus]
But you know that it's a snake eat snake world
We slither and serpentine through
We all took a bite and six thousand years later
This apple's getting harder to chew
You might also like[Chorus]
'Cause tonight, boys, we're eating like kings
'Cause we've all tasted death too much it seems
Yeah, tonight, boys, we're eating like kings
