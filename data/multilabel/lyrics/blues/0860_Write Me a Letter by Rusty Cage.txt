I know that I haven’t been around in a bit
But Mama, don’t think that I could ever forget
You probably been wondering as to where that I’ve been
Got picked up last week, and I’m stuck in the pin
And I know that I haven’t been the best son
You can’t forgive for all the things that I done
But my attorney tells me that I got a good case
So write me a letter, Ma, and send me your grace

[Chorus]
Write me a letter, give me a call
'Cause I’ve been inside for way too long
With all of my sorrows and all my regrets
Write me a letter and help me forget

[Verse 2]
Well hey there John, Man it’s been a long time
And I hope that you and boys are doing just fine
You probably been wondering why I don’t hang around
I’ve been stuck in county since that shit went down
And it might be a lot to inquire about
That you and the boys could pull some dough and help me get out
'Cause us and the gang, man, ain’t we been through it all?
Just let me know, buddy, just give me a call
You might also like[Chorus]
Write me a letter, give me a call
'Cause I’ve been inside for way too long
With all of my sorrows and all my regrets
Write me a letter and help me forget

[Verse 3]
Knowing you’re with me, it keeps me holding on
Knowing you miss me whenever I’m gone
With you all in my heart, is my only escape
And oh, how I wish for a loving embrace

[Verse 4]
Well Mama, I haven’t heard from you in a while
It’s been about a year but I’m still trying to smile
I couldn’t pull bail and I lost in the case
And ain’t no one willing to help out in this place
I hope you get this, I hope you respond
'Cause I ain’t talked to no one ever since I’ve been gone
And I don’t know if I’ll ever see you all again
I just want a family, I just want a friend

[Chorus]
So, write me a letter, give me a call
'Cause I’ve been inside for way too long
With all of my sorrows and all my regrets
Write me a letter and help me forget
Write me a letter, give me a call
'Cause I’ve been inside for way too long
With all of my sorrows and all my regrets
Write me a letter and help me forget
