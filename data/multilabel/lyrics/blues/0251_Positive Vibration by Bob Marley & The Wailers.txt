Got to have a good vibe!

[Verse 1]
If you get down and you quarrel everyday
You are saying prayers to the devils, I say, wo-oh-ooh!
Why not help one another on the way?
Make it much easier (Just a little bit easier)

[Verse 2]
Say you just can't live that negative way
If you know what I mean
Make way for the positive day
Because it's news (New day) - news and days
New time (New time), and if it's a new feeling (New feeling), yeah!
Said it's a new Zion (New sign)
Oh, what a new day!

[Chorus 2]
Picking up?
Are you picking up now?
Jah love, Jah love (Protect us)
Jah love, Jah love (Protect us)
Jah love, Jah love (Protect us)
