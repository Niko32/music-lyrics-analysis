She can wear a nightgown to a wedding
A t-shirt to bed
Or short skirts in the olden times
Some daisies wrapped 'round her head
You can find my woman dancing in bare feet
On the couch in a ballroom dress
And I love how my baby looks at me
With arms draped 'round my neck

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "Oh, honey, just like that"
I give you my loving and you give it right back
I said, "Oh, honey, just like this"
Hanging on, white knuckle grip

[Chorus]
(It's all on my mind)
Feel something when I kiss you goodnight
(It's all on my mind)
Feel something when I open my eyes
(It's all on my mind)
Feel that I could be your sweetest compromise
It's all on my mind
It's all on my mind
You might also like[Verse 2]
I could wear wing tips to a wedding
501s to bed
A full suit to the party
We dance 'til all that's left
And I kiss my baby with a sweetness
That only she could bring
And I love how my baby touches me
So play our lover's game

[Pre-Chorus]
I said, "Oh, honey, just like that"
I give you my loving and you give it right back
I said, "Oh, honey, just like this"
Hanging on, white knuckle grip

[Chorus]
(It's all on my mind)
Feel something when I kiss you good night
(It's all on my mind)
Feel something when I open my eyes
(It's all on my mind)
Feel that I could be your sweetest compromise
It's all on my mind
It's all on my mind
Oohh!!
[Piano Solo]

[Bridge]
Me and my baby are bass and the beat
Lo-fi rhythm, the sweat and the heat
Come on lover, won't you follow my lead?
Move on into the night

[Chorus]
But it's all on my mind
Feel something when I kiss you good night
(It's all on my mind)
Feel something when I open my eyes
(It's all on my mind)
Feel that I could be your sweetest compromise
It's all on my mind
It's all on my mind
Oohh!!
