You got it go, Carlos Santana, yeah

[Verse 1]
Where you are, that's where I wanna be
Through your eyes are all the things I wanna see
In the night you are my dream
You're everything to me

[Chorus]
You're the love of my life
And the breath in my prayers
Take my hand and lead me there
What I need is you here

[Verse 2]
I can't forget the taste of your mouth
From your lips, all the heavens pour out
I can't forget when we are one
With you alone I am free

[Refrain]
Everyday, every night
You alone are the love of my life

[Interlude]
Oh, oh yeah
Alright, alright
You might also like[Refrain]
Everyday, every night
You alone are the love of my life

[Bridge]
We go dancing in the moonlight
With the starlight in your eyes
We go dancing till the sunrise
You and me, we're gonna dance, dance, dance

[Instrumental Outro]
