I wake up tomorrow today
Just help me find my head
I could be dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Where to go, what to say
When you're crossin' my line
Oh, give me time, give me time
Oh, just like they said

[Chorus]
I live my life alone
Never going home
Just like they said
It's just a song to sing, it's just a song to sing

[Verse]
I wake up tomorrow today
Just help me find my head
I could be dead

[Pre-Chorus]
Where to go, what to say
When you're crossin' my line
Oh, give me time, give me time
Oh, just like they said
You might also like[Chorus]
I live my life alone
Never going home
Just like they said
It's just a song to sing, it's just a song to sing

[Outro]
Give me love, give me love
Give me love love love love love love
Well, just like they said
