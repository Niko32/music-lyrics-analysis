Don't get mad : we don't mean no harm

There was a little black rooster : met a little brown hen
Made a date at the barn : about half past ten

I went to see my gal : up across the hall
Found another mule : kicking in my stall

Now the gal I love : she's long and slim
When she whip it : it's too bad Jim

Now the rooster crowed : and the hen looked around
At the *bom bom diddly* : got to carry me into town

Mama had a little dog : and its name was Ball
And if you give him a little taste : he want it all

Uncle Bud and Aunt Jane : went to *take a pan hon*
Aunt Jane fell down : and Uncle Bud

If you see my gal : tell her to hurry home
I ain't had no sass : since she been gone

I wear my britches : up above my knees
Strut my jelly : with who I please
You might also likeUncle Bill came home : about half past ten
He see in the hole : but he couldn't get in

Me and my brother : was up in the loft
We was seeing a film : when they broke it off
