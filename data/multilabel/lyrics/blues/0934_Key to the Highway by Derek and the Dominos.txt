[Chorus]
I got the key
To the highway
Billed out and bound to go
I'm gonna leave here runnin'
Walkin' is much too slow

[Verse 1]
I'm going back
To the border
Woman, where I'm better known
You know you haven't done nothin'
Drove a good man away from home

[Instrumental Break/Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
Oh give me one
One more kiss mama
Just before I go
'Cause when I leave this time you know I
I won't be back no more

[Chorus]
I got the key
Key to the highway
Billed out and bound to go
I'm gonna leave here runnin'
Walkin' is most too slow
You might also like[Instrumental Break/Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I got the key
To the highway
Oh woah, Billed out and bound to go
I'm gonna leave here runnin'
Walkin' is most too slow

[Verse 3]
I'm going back
Back to the border
Babe, I'd better go
You know you haven't done nothin'
Drove a good man away from home

[Instrumental Outro/Guitar Solo]
