I been high
I been low
I been everywhere I wanted to go
But I never been here before
I been all around the world
Even outer space
But what I'm seeing right now
Feels like a brand new place

[Pre-Chorus]
I was so damn close
If it was a snake
It would have bit me
Crawling right under my nose
Baby I must admit it
That I really didn't get it

[Chorus]
But now you got me singing
La-la-ba-dee-dah
La-la-ba-dee-dah
How could I have been so blind?
Cause now you got me singing
La-la-ba-dee-dah
Oh baby
La-la-ba-dee-dah
For the first time in my life
I see love
I see love
You might also like[Verse 2]
I been in
I been out
Of every kind of love affair
But all I ever got was the blues
I've had money, cars
And some good champagne
But your love much better
Than all them things

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so glad to have you
Here with me
Standing right under my nose
Baby I must admit it
That now I really get it

[Chorus]
And that's why I'm singing
La-la-ba-dee-dah
La-la-ba-dee-dah
How could I have been so blind?
Lord have mercy, you got me singing
La-la-ba-dee-dah
Oh baby
La-la-ba-dee-dah
For the first time in my life
I see love
I see love
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh and I'm so glad to have you
Here with me
Standing right under my nose
Baby I must admit it
That now I really get it

[Chorus]
And that's why I'm singing
La-la-ba-dee-dah
La-la-ba-dee-dah
How could I have been so blind?
Cause now you got me singing
La-la-ba-dee-dah
Oh baby
La-la-ba-dee-dah
For the first time in my life
I see love
I see love

[Outro]
Oh baby
La-ba-dee-dah
For the first time in my life
I see love
