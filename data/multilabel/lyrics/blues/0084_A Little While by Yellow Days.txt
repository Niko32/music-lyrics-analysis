"What's your definition of love?"
"Love, it's kinda like, you know, when you see a fog in the morning when you wake up, before the sun comes out. It's just for a little while, and then it burns away..."

[Verse 1]
Broken by love
This hurt divides itself
Decided that kissing you is just bad for my health

[Bridge]
So I'm gonna ride
I'm going the other way
I would've told you why
If there was any space for me
To say, to say

[Chorus]
Oh don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
Oh don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while

[Verse 2]
I looked you right in your eye
And asked you why it has to be this way
I don't know
And to my surprise, you did say
This is just you and I babe
You and I babe
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
Oh don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while

[Bridge]
So I'm gonna ride
I'm going the other way
I would've told you why
If there was any space for me
To say, to say

[Chorus]
Oh don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
Oh don't you see it now?
I'm staying for a little while
