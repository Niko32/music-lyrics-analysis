I walk 47 miles of barbed wire
I use a cobra-snake for a necktie
I got a brand new house on the roadside
Made from rattlesnake hide
I got a brand new chimney made on top
Made out of a human skull
Now come on take a little walk with me, Arlene
And tell me, who do you love?

[Chorus]
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

[Verse 2]
Tombstone hand and a graveyard mind
Just 22 and I don't mind dying

[Chorus]
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
You might also like[Verse 3]
I rode a lion into town, use a rattlesnake whip
Take it easy Arlene, don't give me no lip

[Chorus]
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

[Instrumental Verse]

[Verse 4]
Night was dark, but the sky was blue
Down the alley a ice-wagon flew
Hit a bump and somebody screamed
You should have heard just what I seen

[Chorus]
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?

[Verse 5]
Arlene took me by my hand
She said, "Ooh-ee Bo, you know I understand"
[Chorus]
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
Who do you love?
