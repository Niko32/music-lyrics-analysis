And I rules my den
You know I'm a crawlin' king snake baby
And I rules my den
I don't want you hangin' round my mate
Wanna use her for myself

You know you caught me crawlin' baby
When the, when the grass was very high
I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now baby
Until the day I die
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake baby
And I rules my den
Don't want you hangin' round my mate
Wanna use her for myself

You know I'm gon' crawl up to your window
Gonna crawl up to your door
You got anything I want, baby
Gonna crawl up on your floor
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake baby
And I rules my den

You know you caught me crawlin' baby
When the, when the grass was very high
I'm just gonna keep on crawlin' now baby
Until the day I die
Because I'm a crawlin' king snake baby
And I rules my denYou might also like
