April in Paris, chestnuts in blossom
Holiday tables under the trees
April in Paris, this is a feeling
That no one can ever reprise

[Verse 2]
I never knew the charm of spring
Never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace

[Verse 3]
Till April in Paris
Whom can I run to
What have you done to
My heart

[Verse 4]
I never knew the charm of spring
Never met it face to face
I never knew my heart could sing
Never missed a warm embrace

[Outro]
Till April in Paris
Whom can I run to
What did you mean to
What have you done to
My heartYou might also like
