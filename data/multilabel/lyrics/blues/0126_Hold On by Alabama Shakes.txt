Bless my heart, bless my soul
Didn't think I'd make it to twenty-two years old
There must be someone up above
Sayin', "Come on, Brittany, you got to come on up

[Chorus]
You got to hold on
Hey, you got to hold on"

[Verse 2]
So, bless my heart and bless yours, too
I don't know where I'm gonna go
Don't know what I'm gonna do
There must be somebody up above
Sayin', "Come on, Brittany, you got to come on up

[Chorus]
You got to hold on
Hey, you got to hold on"

[Bridge]
"Yeah, you gotta wait
Yeah, you gotta wait"
But I don't wanna wait
No, I don't wanna wait

So, bless my heart and bless my mind
I got so much to do, I ain't got much time
So, must be someone up above
Saying "Come on, girl
Yeah, you got to get back up

[Chorus]
You got to hold on
Hey, you got to hold on"

[Bridge]
"Yeah, you gotta wait"
I don't wanna wait
But I don't wanna wait
No, I don't wanna wait

[Outro]
You gotta hold on
You gotta hold on
You gotta hold on
You gotta hold on
