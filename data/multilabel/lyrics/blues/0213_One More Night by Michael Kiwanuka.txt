One more night
One more night till the morning
One more night
One more night till the day
I'll be right
I'll be right in the morning
I'll be alright
I'll be right in the day

[Chorus]
But I believe it
One more night till the morning
But I believe it
One more night till the morning

[Verse 2]
I'll be trying
I'll be trying in the morning
I'll be trying
I'll be trying in the day
No more lies
No more lies in the morning
No more lies
No more lies in the day
You might also like[Chorus]
But I believe it
One more night till the morning
But I believe it
One more night till the morning

[Bridge]
I'll be holding on
Holding in
I'll be holding on
And holding in
I'll be holding on
And holding in

[Verse 3]
One more night
One more night till the morning
One more night
One more night till the day

I'm on fire
I'm on fire for the morning
I'm on fire
I'm on fire for the day

[Chorus]
But I believe it
One more night till the morning
But I believe it
One more night till the morning
[Outro]
One more night till the morning
One more night till the morning
One more night till the morning
