Yeah, so it goes, yeah, so it goes
That sweet heirloom, them abbey stones
Oh, take a chance and roll the bones
Cut off your hair, unplug your phone
Yeah, and sell your belongings, all your clever drawings
Yeah, try to make a dollar from the grave
Sell your belongings, all your clever drawings
Try to make a dollar from the grave
Oh, but who's to blame?

[Verse 2]
Yeah, so it goes, yeah, so it goes
Them city boys in country clothes
Oh, take a chance and roll the bones
Go crash your car, burn down your home

[Bridge]
And try to forget all them enemies and debts
Yeah, they'll just chase you 'round and give you sour dreams
Try to forget all them enemies and debts
Yeah, they'll just chase you 'round and give you sour dreams
Oh, so it seems
So it seems

[Verse 3]
Yeah, so struggle all you like
Yeah, put up the good fight
They say that someday everybody dies alone
Yeah, struggle all you like
Yeah, put up the good fight
They say that someday everybody dies alone
But hey, who knows?
Yeah, hey, who knows?
Yeah, hey, who really knows?
Yeah, who really knows?You might also like
