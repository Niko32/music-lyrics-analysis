Hey you, I'm up from the Bayou
Where wildlife runs free
You could say that I'm country
But let me tell you what I see

[Verse 2]
Your world is plastic
Can see through to the other side
Your cities are made of wood
Antiques are what you've got inside

[Verse 3]
Houses are paper
But folks don't hear a word you say
Friendship's like acid
It burns as it slides away

[Refrain]
So you see, my patience is growin' thin
With this synthetic world we're livin' in

[Verse 4]
A word imitation
Lives across the nation
What's real has become a freak
Someone's tryin' to make me weak
Strange initials to keep me blind
Psychedelic music to blow my mind
You might also like[Refrain]
So you see, my patience is growin' thin
With this synthetic world we're livin' in

[Verse 5]
Spray to clear the air, air to clear the spray
Makin' people die every day
And now I find I'm out of place
If I only have one face
All my friends have more than two
No longer must you be you
They found out how to transplant
Maybe "has" replaced "can't"

[Refrain]
So, you see, my patience is growin' thin
With this synthetic world we're livin' in, hmm

[Outro]
