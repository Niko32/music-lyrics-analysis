Hey now, all you sinners
Put your lights on
Put your lights on
Hey now, all you lovers
Put your lights on
Put your lights on
Hey now, all you killers
Put your lights on
Put your lights on
Hey now, all you children
Leave your lights on
Better leave your lights on

[Verse 1]
'Cause there's a monster livin' under my bed
Whisperin' in my ear
There's an angel with her hand on my head
She say, "I got nothin' to fear
There's a darkness livin' deep in my soul
I still got a purpose to serve
So let your light shine
Deep into my home
God, don't let me lose my nerve
Don't let me lose my nerve"

Hey now (Hey now), hey now (Hey now)
Whoa-oh, hey now (Hey now)
Hey now (Hey now), hey now (Hey now)

[Chorus]
Hey now, all you sinners
Put your lights on
Put your lights on
Hey now, all you children
Leave your lights on
You better leave your lights on

[Verse 2]
'Cause there's a monster livin' under my bed
Whisperin' in my ear
And there's an angel
With her hand on my head
She say, "I got nothin' to fear"
She say, "La la-ah, ay la-la, you all shine like stars
La, la-ah, ay la-la, you all shine like stars
Let me fade away"
