Stood there boldly
Sweatin' in the sun
Felt like a million
Felt like number one
The height of summer
I'd never felt that strong
Like a rock

[Verse 2]
I was eighteen
Didn't have a care
Working for peanuts
Not a dime to spare
But I was lean and
Solid everywhere
Like a rock

[Verse 3]
My hands were steady
My eyes were clear and bright
My walk had purpose
My steps were quick and light
And I held firmly
To what I felt was right
Like a rock
You might also like[Chorus]
Like a rock—I was strong as I could be
Like a rock—nothin' ever got to me
Like a rock—I was something to see
Like a rock

[Bridge]
And I stood arrow straight
Unencumbered by the weight
Of all these hustlers and their schemes
I stood proud—I stood tall
High above it all
I still believed in my dreams

[Verse 4]
Twenty years now
Where'd they go?
Twenty years
I don't know
I sit and I wonder sometimes
Where they've gone

[Verse 5]
And sometimes late at night
Oh, when I'm bathed in the firelight
The moon comes callin' a ghostly white
And I recall
I recall
[Chorus]
Like a rock—standin' arrow straight
Like a rock—chargin' from the gate
Like a rock—carryin' the weight
Like a rock
Oh like a rock—the sun upon my skin
Like a rock—hard against the wind
Like a rock—I see myself again
Like a rock—oh like a rock
