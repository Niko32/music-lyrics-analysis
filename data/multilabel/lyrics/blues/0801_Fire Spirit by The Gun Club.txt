I can see clearly
From my diamond eyes

[Chorus]
I'm going to the mountain with the fire spirit
And no-one will accept all of me
So the fire will stop

[Verse 2]
Up through the streets
And the gunfire of cars

[Chorus]
I'm going to the mountain with the fire spirit
Where no-one will take all of me
So the fire will stop

[Verse 3]
I will be cheating
The whole ritual

[Chorus]
I'm going to the mountain with the fire spirit
No-one will expect all of me
So the fire will stop
Uh

Someone will step out of the circle
Someone will turn and burn a world
Someone knows a better cell
Where the old north wind blows through southeast hell, yeah

[Verse 5]
Invention was betrayed by the machine
Promised like it was a-promised to me
I'm going up to the mountain to see
How the last thing will set me free, yeah

[Bridge]
I had to do something, I was wearing down
I was going down
Why can no one ever touch a Fire Spirit?
Why can no one ever hold a Fire Spirit?
Why can no one ever feel a Fire Spirit?
I am going to the mountain
I am going to the mountain
I am going to the mountain

[Verse 6]
And I can see clearly
From my diamond eyes
[Chorus]
I'm going to the mountain with the fire spirit
No-one will accept all of me
And so the fire will stop

[Verse 7]
With too much patience
And too much pain

[Chorus]
I'm going to the mountain with the fire spirit
To make amends for all of me
And the fire will stop
