Wearin' your black dress, red shoes, makeup, perfume, and diamonds
You always impress, turn heads, the second you walk through the door
You're like a real-life work of fine art, baby, you're priceless
But I just wanna get home, get that black dress down on the floor

[Chorus]
'Cause when you got nothin' on
There ain't nothin' wrong
Lovin' you all night long's
All I wanna do
I've seen the mountains high
I've sailed the ocean blue
But when you got nothin' on
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you

[Verse 2]
You're better than Venice, Vegas, New York, LA, or Paris
Baby, you're Vermont in the fall, the Grand Canyon on a full moon
Oh, and they can keep those highrise, high price mansions, I wouldn't trade places
Long as I'm here with you, baby, I've got a room with a view

[Chorus]
'Cause when you got nothin' on
There ain't nothin' wrong
Lovin' you all night long's
All I wanna do
I've seen the mountains high
I've sailed the ocean blue
But when you got nothin' on
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you
You might also like[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Yeah, 'cause I've seen the mountains high
I've sailed the ocean blue
But when you got nothin' on
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you
When you got nothin' on
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you
Ain't nothin' got nothin' on you, baby
