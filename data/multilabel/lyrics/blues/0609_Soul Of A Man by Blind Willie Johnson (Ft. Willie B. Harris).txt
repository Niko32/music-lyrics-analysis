Well, I want somebody to tell me, answer if you can!
'Want somebody tell me, just what is the soul of a man?

I'm going to ask the question, please answer if you can
If anybody surely can tell me, just what is the soul of a man?

[Chorus]
Well, I want somebody tell me, answer if you can!
I Want somebody to tell me, just what is the soul of a man?

I've traveled different countries, I've traveled in foreign lands
I've found nobody could tell me, just what about the soul of a man

[Chorus]
Well, I want somebody tell me, answer if you can!
I Want somebody tell me, just what is the soul of a man?

I saw a crowd stand talking, I just came up in time
Was teaching the lawyers,  the doctors, that a man ain't nothing but his mind

[Chorus] x2
Well, I want somebody tell me, answer if you can!
God I Want somebody tell me, just what is the soul of a man?

You might also likeI reads the Bible often, I tries to read it right
As far as I could understand,  nothin' but a burnin' light

[Chorus]
God, I want somebody tell me, answer if you can!
I Want somebody to tell me, just what is the soul of a man?

When Christ stood in the Temple, the people all stood amazed
Was teaching the lawyers, doctors, how to raise the man from the grave

[Chorus] x2
Well, I want somebody tell me, answer if you can!
'Want somebody tell me, just what is the soul of a man?
