I've been tried, and I've been tested
I was born tired, I never got rested
Harder than marble stone
I'm better off, better off left alone

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not the one, no I'm not the one
You wanted it all, but I give you, give you none
No, I'm not the one

[Verse 2]
Well, like a toy, to a kid
I said jump, and, mama, you did
And you know, your daddy knows and your mama knows that's wrong
So now it's time for me to move on

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not the one, no I'm not the one
A-you wanted it all, but I give you, give you none
I'm not the one

[Interlude]
No, oh no-ah
Ah nah, nah, nah
No, oh no-ah
I'm not the one
You might also like[Verse 3]
You think that I'm normal
All these years I'm just tryin' to warn ya
You'd do good to move on
No it won't, it won't hurt me none

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not the one, no I'm not the one
But you wanted it all, but I give you, give you none
'Cause I'm not the one, no I'm not the one

[Outro]
Yeah, oh-oh-oh
No-oh, I'm not the one
Uh, not the one, for you
Not the one, oh, not the one
