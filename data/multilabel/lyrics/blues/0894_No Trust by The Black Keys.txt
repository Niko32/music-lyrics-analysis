She wants to get out of the car
In the middle of the road
And her screaming and hollerin'
Is getting mighty old
She checks every paper
When you step out the room

[Chorus]
Ain't got no trust in your mama
Ain't got no trust in your daddy
Ain't got no trust in your sister
And she ain't got trust in you

[Verse 2]
She want a simple life
She need a simple man
That don't drink or smoke darling
Play in a rock and roll band
Oh, but she want you to hold her at night when she lonely and blue
(Hey)

[Chorus]
Ain't got no trust in your mama
Ain't got no trust in your daddy
Ain't got no trust in your sister
And she ain't got trust in you
You might also like[Verse 3]
Yeah she's a beautiful gal
And when she wanna be
But if you told her so darling
She'd just disagree
Oh, she hate your job and what you wanting to do

[Chorus]
Ain't got no trust in your mama
Ain't got no trust in your daddy
Ain't got no trust in your sister
And she ain't got trust in you
