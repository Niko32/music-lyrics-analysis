Late night, my shoes are worn, in a diner, it's 2 in the morn'
And I wonder, what will I do tonight?
Cup of coffee and a cigarette more, clock above me reads 2:04
And the nightowls all got a story to tell
The girl with the short hair's parents won't speak to her no more
They call her an unholy dyke and they call her a whore
Oh well

[Verse 2]
Order a bagel, butter and all, think to myself as I stare at the wall
Killin' time, counting the change in my hand
Dark man sits on my right, shades keeping his eyes out of light
Drinks his coffee just as black as his skin
The man with the pack and the black hat sits in the back
His white eyes glow like a fire burns bright in the act

[Verse 3]
Woah, and the fat man comes in with little hair
His wife is unfaithful but he doesn't care
As long as he can hold her tight at night
Yeah, and the waitress Julie is a poet now
She writes her stories on a paper towel
To publish them someday, she said she might
And the man in the back tips his hat as he stands and he grins
The first word he says all night is "Let the show begin."

Julie wants to have some fun
So she takes a butter knife and cuts her fingers off one by one
To find a problem when she tries to start on her next hand
Yeah, and the fat man strips down the whore
She cries to herself and defecates on the floor
I don't think I want the second half of my bagel no more
The fat man started to say how he wants to kill his wife
As the dyke cuts off his tongue with a jagged knife
(She keeps in her pocket)

[Bridge]
And the two are making passionate love
And the dark, blind man thinks he's seen enough
So he takes Julie's pen from her right hand
And he stabs his eyes, as according to plan
'Cause the man in the back simply laughs and he smiles
And the blood spills out on linoleum tile
And the fat man starts to eat the flesh of the whore
Yeah, the mood's a little different than a minute before

[Harmonica Solo]

[Outro]
I reach down for the last cigarette in the pack
Walk over and sit with the man in the back
And ask him "Why?", he tips his hat and he smiles
