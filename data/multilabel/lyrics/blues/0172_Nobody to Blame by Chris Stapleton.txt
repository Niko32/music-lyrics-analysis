She took down the photograph of our wedding day
Ripped it down the middle and threw my half away
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Verse 2]
She broke all my fishing rods, put my guns in hock
Threw my clothes out in the yard
And changed out all the locks
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Chorus]
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Verse 3]
She fired up my old hot rod, ran it in the pond
Put sugar in my John Deere
I can't even mow my lawn
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
You might also like[Verse 4]
She built her a bonfire with my old six string
Took all my good whiskey and poured it down the drain
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me

[Chorus]
I know right where I went wrong
I know just what got her gone
Turned my life into this country song
And I got nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
Nobody to blame but me
I got nobody to blame but me
