My heart has been a chessboard
Making moves and losing out
Played so many times before
And there ain't nothing to brag about
But this must be a new brew
When you're gone I'm singing Blue Moon
You turn me all the way around
And I'm tired of the fine line

[Chorus]
I just want you to be forever mine
Be forever mine

Oh and there's nothing I can sing now
That ain't been sung before
Oh but your love is a standout
So go on ahead and take the floor
You had to Jimi my heart loose
Now I'm stuck in your voodoo
Pick me up, don't ever put me down
Look I'm tired of the fine line

[Chorus]
I just want you to be forever mine
I want you to be forever mine
You might also like[Bridge]
The way that you move, never seen it before
Looking for my head, canâ€™t find it no more
You ransom my heart and I get the reward
Winning the crown like a Trojan horse
I come back, back, back every time
You got me shook like the Mobb when they rhyme
Come out of nowhere come blessing my life
I just want you to be forever mine, oh oh

[Chorus]
Be forever mine
Be forever mine

[Verse 3]
Oh but you was cookin' up a new stew
Must have put something in my food
Cause now I'm lost up in the clouds
Oh and I'm tired of the fine line

[Chorus]
I just want you to be forever mine
Oh you gotta be, be forever mine
