Cancun or Paris
We can get away
As long as I'm with you
A penthouse suite
You bring the lingerie
We'll do what lovers do
I don't know if it's love or lust
But I know that
There's no stopping us
I'll kiss you touch you
Bite you love you
Girl let's ride
You’ve got me out my mind
And baby you got nothing to lose
We'll sip champagne
With ocean views
Come on what's the move

[Chorus: Phe Reds]
You leave me so senseless
Defenseless
Girl I'm senseless for you

[Verse 2: pH-1]
I get it how I live it
When the life be
Giving lemons to me
Cus baby you my sugar
We can juice it up
And sell it for free
Imma run the stand
You can flash pretty eyes
But I’m dying inside like suicide
My face gets numb
I’m way tensed up
You can tell I’m real nervous
I’m sayin something dumb
If you’d like I could be
A little cocky
Have you call me papi
You could be the wifey
Wait and see
My name getting bigger
We should branch out
And just start a family tree
You might also like[Chorus: Phe Reds]
You leave me so senseless
Defenseless
Girl I'm senseless for you

[Bridge: Phe Reds]
We don't got to keep no schedule
Anyone could see
That you're special
And I'll give that affection
With no second guessing
It's you

[Chorus: Phe Reds]
You leave me so senseless
Defenseless
Girl I'm senseless for you
Yeah
You leave me so senseless
Defenseless
Senseless for you
