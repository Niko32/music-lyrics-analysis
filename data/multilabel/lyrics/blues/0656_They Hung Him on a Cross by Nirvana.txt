They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross
For me

[Chorus]
One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me

[Verse 2]
They whooped him up the hill
They whooped him up the hill
They whooped him up the hill
For me

[Chorus]
One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They whooped him up the hill for me

[Verse 3]
He never said a mumblin' word
He never said a mumblin' word
He never said a mumblin' word
For me

One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me

[Verse 4]
They bit him in the side
They bit him in the side
They bit him in the side
For me

[Chorus]
One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me

[Verse 5]
He hung his head and died
He hung his head and died
He hung his head and died
For me

[Chorus]
One day when I was lost
They hung him on a cross
They hung him on a cross for me
