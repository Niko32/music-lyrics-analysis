'Cause I'm back down on my own again
This is the blues I'm playing
Yes it's a fine old thing
When the night is cold and lonely
This is the midnight blues

This is the midnight blues
For the girl I left behind me
Ain't it a fine old thing
This is the blues
Just a feeling deep inside of me
This is the midnight bluesYou might also like
