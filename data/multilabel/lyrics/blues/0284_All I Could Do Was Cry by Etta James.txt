I heard church bells ringin'
I heard a choir singin'
I saw my love walk down the aisle
On her finger, he placed a ring

[Verse 2]
Oh, I saw them holding hands
She was standing there with my man
I heard them promise, "'Til death do us part"
Each word was a pain in my heart

[Chorus]
All I could do, all I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)
All I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)
I was losing the man that I love
And all I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)

[Verse 3]
And now, the wedding's over
Rice, rice has been thrown over their heads
For them, life has just begun
But mine is at an end

[Chorus]
All, all I could do, all I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)
All I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)
I was losing the man that I love
And all I could do was cry (Cry, cry, cry)You might also like
