Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 1]
My name is Junior, from Memphis, Tennessee
My daddy was a hustler and a stranger to me
I donâ€™t always know just what to say (Now listen)
Do I look familiar in any kind of way?

[Chorus]
Well I remember you dancin' on the floor
I remember you walkin' out the door
You had a red dress on and some high heel shoes
You don't remember me but I remember you

[Verse 2]
You had a margarita, I had a beer
I wondered what a woman like you
Was doing way down here
You tore my heart apart, the moment you left
Junior had a night he would never forget

[Chorus]
I remember you dancin' on the floor
I remember you walkin' out the door
You had a red dress on and some high heel shoes
You don't remember me but I remember you
You might also like[Bridge]
Well maybe I was just a number
A face without a name
Now and then I wonder
Will I ever be the same?

[Chorus]
I remember you dancin' on the floor
I remember you walkin' out the door
You had a red dress on and some high heel shoes
You don't remember me but I remember you

[Outro]
You don't remember me but I remember you (Oh no)
I remember you
I remember you
Walkin' out the door, yeah
Dancin' on the floor (Mhmm, mmm)
You you you you

[Instrumental]
