People worry
What are they worrying about today?
People worry
What are they worrying about today?
Seem like there's a good reason
To worry, worry, worry
Seem like there's a damn good reason
To worry, worry, worry
I'd sit around, I'd listen to your story
If I wasn't in such a hurry, hurry, hurry

[Verse 2]
And I'm so lonely
I don't think I can take it anymore
And I'm so lonely
I just don't know what to do
I'm so lonely
Feel like I'm gonna crawl away and die
I'm so lonely
Feel like I'm gonna hack it apart
I'm so lonely
Feel like I'm gonna crawl away and die
I'm so lonely
Feel like I'm gonna hack it apart
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm gonna hack, hack, hack, hack it apart
I'm gonna hack, hack, hack, hack it apart
I'm gonna hack, hack, hack, hack it apart
I'm gonna hack, hack, hack, hack it aâ€”

[Verse 3]
Seem like there's a good reason
To be lonely, lonely, lonely
I gotta get something or somebody or something to make me feel less, less
Less lonely, lonely, lonely
I know I could do it, I, I know I could do it, if, if, if
If I just wasn't so lonely, lonely, lonely

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
Have we got an army?
We'll teach you how to act like a man
Have we got an army?
Let me tell you, we can fight
Have we got an army?
And we're gonna do it tonight

[Chorus]
We're gonna do, do, do, do it tonight
Yeah, we're gonna do, do, do, do it tonight
Alright, we're gonna do, do, do, do it tonight
Alright, we're gonna do, do, do, do it tonight
Yeah, they're gonna pay, pay, pay, pay it tonight (Do, do, do, do it tonight)
They're gonna pay, pay, pay, pay it tonight (Do, do, do, do it tonight)
They're gonna pay, pay, pay, pay it tonight (Do, do, do, do it tonight)
They're gonna pay, pay, pay, pay it tonight (Do, do, do, do it tonight)
[Outro]
People worry
What are they worrying about today?
People worry
Now you see I've learned my lessons
And I don't even wanna hear about your confessions
