[Verse 1]
Your eyes may be whole
But the story I'm told
Is your heart is as black as night
Your lips may be sweet
Such that I can't compete
But your heart is as black as night

[Hook]
I don't know why you came along
At such a perfect time
But if I let you hang around
I'm bound to lose my mind

[Verse 2]
'Cause your hands may be strong
But the feeling's all wrong
Your heart is as black as night

[Instrumental Break]

[Hook]
I don't know why you came along
At such a perfect time
But if I let you hang around
I'm bound to lose my mind

'Cause your hands may be strong
But the feeling's all wrong
Your heart is as black
Your heart is as black
Oh, your heart is as black as night
