With his long white beard and a crooked staff
He tramps along while the folks all laugh
With a twinkle in his eye, he passes them by
The Old Man of the Mountain
For he wears long hair and his feet are bare
He says he's mad as an old march hare
But his cares are none and he owes no one
The Old Man of the Mountain

[Bridge]
He talks with the birds when he's lonely
He sleeps with the stars for a tent
The bees spread a feast when he's hungry
And God charges no rent

[Verse 2]
He'll live as long as the old oak tree
And laugh at fools like you and me
Oh, I often sigh and wish that I
Were the Old Man of the Mountain
