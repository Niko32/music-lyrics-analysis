I came upon a butcher, he was slaughtering a lamb
I accused him there with his tortured lamb
He said, "Listen to me, child, I am what I am
And you, you are my only son"

[Verse 2]
Well, I found a silver needle, I put it into my arm
It did some good, did some harm
But the nights were cold and it almost kept me warm
How come the night is long?

[Verse 3]
I saw some flowers growing up where that lamb fell down
Was I supposed to praise my Lord? Make some kind of joyful sound?
He said, "Listen, listen to me now, I go round and round
And you, you are my only child"

[Verse 4]
Do not leave me now, do not leave me now
I'm broken down from a recent fall
Blood upon my body and ice upon my soul
Lead on, my son, is your world
