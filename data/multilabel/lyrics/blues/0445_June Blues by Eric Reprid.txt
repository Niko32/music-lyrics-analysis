Down
Yeah
I been feelin' so, I been feelin' so
Down
Yeah
Can you tell me why, can you tell me why
I'm down
Yeah
No friends of mine, no friends of mine
Around
Yeah
Now I'm thinkin' I, now I'm thinkin' I

[Pre-Chorus]
Might've caught the June Blues
Yeah I wanna
Drown myself inside the juice
Yeah you know I
Keep on runnin' from the truth
What's that now
I'm just a lonely fuckin' youth
Now when I drive around don't feel at all
Why it's gettin' colder when the sun come out
Might just waste away don't know what life about
'Nother day go by don't know what got me down

Walk 'round like who you yeah
Just somethin' you get used to yeah
Go blame the
June Blues yeah
It's just the June Blues yeah
Walk 'round like who you yeah
Just somethin' you get used to

[Verse]
Breakin news got me breakin' breakin' breakin' breakin'
I was present hopeless prayin' prayin' prayin' prayin'
Struck down at 20 plenty left to put behind you
You ain't peaked death was peekin' now they speakin' bout you
Leave it 'lone
Hope you grinnin' while you watch yo vros
On some soulful sunny shit to brighten up a wounded soul
Honest you did plenty uh
Pick it up like Chevy uh
New age Machiavelli uh
Disagree don't tempt me uh
Now you with Infinity we 98'
Trust that he be good
On the ball like bb don't make no mistakes
Got the faith
The 18th just not gon' be the same
Finna bleed down generations not gon' be in vain
Too young
Why you gotta go
Why you gotta go
I just wanna know
I just wanna know now
Too numb
Cryin' gettin' old
Cryin' gettin' old
Hope he freed yo soul
Hope he freed yo soul
[Pre-Chorus]
I might've caught the June Blues
Yeah I wanna
Drown myself inside the juice
Yeah you know I
Keep on runnin' from the truth
What's that now
I'm just a lonely fuckin' youth
Now when I drive around don't feel at all
Why it's gettin' colder when the sun come out
Might just waste away don't know what life about
'Nother day go by don't know what got me down

June Blues yeah
I got the June Blues yeah
Walk 'round like who you yeah
Just somethin' you get used to yeah
Go blame the

It's just the June Blues yeah
Walk 'round like who you yeah
