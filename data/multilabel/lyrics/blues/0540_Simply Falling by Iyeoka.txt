There goes my heart again
All of this time I thought we were pretending
Nothing looks the same when your eyes are open
Now you're playing these games to keep my heartbeat spinning

[Pre-Chorus]
You show me love, you show me love
You show me everything my heart is capable of
You reshape me like butterfly origami

[Chorus]
You have broken into my heart
This time I feel the blues have departed
Nothing can keep me away from this feeling
I know I am simply falling for you

[Verse]
I'm taking time to envision where your heart is
And justify why you're gone for the moment
I tumble sometimes, looking for sunshine
And you know this is right when you look into my eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
You show me love, you show me love
You show me everything my heart is capable of
And now I can't break away from this fire that we started
You might also like[Chorus]

[Bridge]
There my heart goes again
In your arms I'm falling deeper
And there's nothing to break me away from this

[Chorus][x2]

[Outro]
There my heart goes again
You have broken into my heart
Oh!
I'm falling deeper, I'm falling deeper
