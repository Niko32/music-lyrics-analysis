Memory, fading out
Its presence still lingers in my mind

[Roy Khan]
Listen to your inner voice
There's no escape, there's no other choice

[Simone Simons]
A foolish fate that came about
Death could not leave without
Don't try to scour your inane soul
It would be labour lost

Deep inside hides a lie
Where can we try to seek
A way so this will die

Innocence died when they took his mind
And they tried to leave him behind

[Roy Khan]
Not even a cascade of tears will save you
And keep you away from harm

[Simone Simons]
Concinnity of destiny
Is not what you wished it to be
You might also likeDeep inside hides a lie

[Simone Simons & Roy Khan]
Where can we try to seek
A way so this will die

[Simone Simons]
Blinded by love
Between lust and hate
You scarred your fate
There's no time to waste

[Roy Khan]
Ride for your own ruin
Odium became your opium

[Simone Simons]
Please don't let me bleed for all eternity

[Simone Simons & Roy Khan]
Deep inside hides a lie
Where can we try to seek
A way so this will die

[Roy Khan]
Please leave me be in my own misery
