Anywhere you are, I am near
Anywhere you go, I'll be there
Anytime you whisper my name, you'll see
Where every single promise I'll keep
'Cause what kind of woman would I be
If I was to leave when you need me most?

[Chorus: Both]
What are words
If you really don't mean them
When you say them?
What are words
If they're only for good times
Then they're done?
When it's love
Yeah, you say them out loud
Those words, They never go away
They live on, even when we're gone

[Verse 2: Peter Hollens]
And I know an angel was sent just for me
And I know I'm meant to be where I am
And I'm gonna be
Standing right beside her tonight
And I'm gonna be by your side
I would never leave when she needs me most

What are words
If you really don't mean them
When you say them?
What are words
If they're only for good times
Then they're done?
When it's love
Yeah, you say them out loud
Those words, They never go away
They live on, even when we're gone

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3: Peter Hollens]
Anywhere you are, I am near
Anywhere you go, I'll be there
And I'm gonna be here forever more
Every single promise I'll keep
'Cause what kind of man would I be
If I was to leave when you need me most?

[Outro: Both]
I'm forever keeping my angel close
