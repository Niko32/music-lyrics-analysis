I'm dreaming dreams
I'm scheming schemes
I'm building castles high
They're born anew
Their days are few
Just like a sweet butterfly
And as the daylight is dawning
They come again in the morning

[Chorus]
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
Nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams
They fade and die
Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air

[Verse 2]
When cattle creep
When I'm asleep
To lands of hope, I stray
Then at daybreak
When I awake
My bluebird flutters away
Happiness new seemed so near me
Happiness come forth and heal me
You might also like[Chorus]
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
They fly so high
Nearly reach the sky
Then like my dreams
They fade and die
Fortune's always hiding
I've looked everywhere
I'm forever blowing bubbles
Pretty bubbles in the air
