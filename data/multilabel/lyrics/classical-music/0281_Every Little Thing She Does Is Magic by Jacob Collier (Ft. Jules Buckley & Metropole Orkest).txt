And though I've tried before to tell her
Of the feelings I have for her in my heart
Every time that I come near her
I just lose my nerve, as I’ve done from the start

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now you know my love for her goes on
On and on and on and on and on and on

[Verse 2]
Now do I have to tell the story
Of a thousand rainy days since we first met?
It's a big enough umbrella
But it's always me that ends up getting wet

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now you know my love for her goes
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now you know my love for her goes on
On and on and on
You might also like[Bridge]
I resolved to call her up a thousand times a day
And ask her if she’ll marry me in some old fashioned way
But my silent fears have gripped me
Long before I reach the phone
Long before, my tongue has tripped me
Must I always be alone?

[Chorus]
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now you know my love for her goes on
Every little thing she does is magic
Everything she do just turn me on
Even though my life before was tragic
Now you know my love for her goes on

[Outro]
Every little thing, every little thing, every little thing
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh (Ooh), eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Every little thing she does, every little thing she does
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Every little thing she does is magic, magic, magic, magic, magic
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh
Eee oh oh, eee oh oh, eee oh oh oh oh oh
