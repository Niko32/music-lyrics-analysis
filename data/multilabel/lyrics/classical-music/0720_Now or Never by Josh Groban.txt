I watch the morning dawn upon your skin
A splinter in the light
It caught and frayed the very heart of us
It's been hiding there inside for all this time

[Pre-Chorus]
How a sure thing winds up just like this?
Clockwork silence only knows

[Chorus]
And it's no one's fault
There's no black and white
Only you and me on this endless night
And as the hours run away with another life
Oh, darling, can't you see? It's now or never
It's now or never

[Verse 2]
Sweeping eggshells, still at 3 AM
We're trying far too hard
The tattered thought balloons above our heads
Sinking in the weight of all we need to say

[Pre-Chorus]
Why's and what if's have since long played out
Left us short on happy endings?
You might also like[Chorus]
And it's no one's fault
There's no black and white
Only you and me on this endless night
And as the hours run away with another life
Oh, darling, can't you see? It's now or never
It's now or never

[Bridge]
(Now or never, it's now or never, now or never)
It's now or never
(Now or never, it's now or never, now or never)
It's now or never
(Now or never, it's now or never, now or never)
You know that there's so much more

[Chorus]
And it's no one's fault
There's no black and white
Only you and me on our final night
And as the hours run away (Run away) with another life
Oh, darling, can't you see? It's now or never
It's now or never
