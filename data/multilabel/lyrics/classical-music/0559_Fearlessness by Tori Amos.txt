Fearlessness blew in with the wind
Waking up to greet the sun
We sailed on like the ancient ones
Into the Nine Underworlds
We knew dangers would come
I had faith in both of us

[Refrain]
Listen to your heart
You can hear me
Listen to your heart
You can hear me

[Verse 2]
Day turned night when he questioned
"Why can't you balance the skies?"
Soulless storms have sent watchers
With blade-less weapons to fight

[Chorus]
Teams of horses of the brine
Followed his cry
Through the fire demons of the wild
Hissed with the wind
Did you listen?
You might also like[Refrain]
Listen to your heart
Can you hear me?
Listen to your heart
Can you hear me?

[Verse 3]
Fearlessness soon reminded me
"You must be stronger than they"
Cautioning, "There are those who live
To be cruel for the fun of it."
He let in a dark companion
That orbited between us
His siren friends convinced him that love
Was no match against storms to come
Their songs inflamed by doubt
Fearlessness drown them out

[Interlude]

[Chorus]
Teams of horses of the brine
Followed his cry
Through the fire demons of the wild
Hissed with the wind
Did you listen?
[Refrain]
Listen to your heart
You can hear me
Listen to your heart
You can hear me

[Outro]
Did we begin without knowing it?
To find fault in every gift
Then that was when the blame began
What were once two forces joined in fearlessness
