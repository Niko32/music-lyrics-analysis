Rosa nera sussurrante
Piange sangue d'innocenza
Dall'abisso lei ritorna
Per urlare la sentenza
Rosa nera sussurrante
Piange sangue d'innocenza
Dall'abisso lei ritorna
Per urlare la sentenza

[Verse 1]
The witches are riding, wolfs howl at the moon
While candles are lighting
The black mess of fools
The daughter of evil the mistress of shame
Her tomb is now open to allow her awake ...
'Cause she is the Princess of Sorrow
'Cause she is the Bringer of Pain
While gothic portals of sadness
Call her unpronounceable name

[Pre-Chorus]
Moonlight is lighting her face
(Lighting her face)
Down in the crypts of the Damned
Her sins will not be the last
(Not be the last)
When the rituals start
You might also like[Chorus]
Black candles burning
Announce her come back
The reign is awaiting
The queen of the dead... of the dead!

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 2]
The poison is ready, the words are pronounced
The portals are open, her soul wanders through
Her body is moving, her heart of bitch pounds
Is Kron who lives in her, in her open wounds
'Cause she was devoted to darkness
Drinking black blood for her god
Witch of perversion and luxury
Suicide as true lover of Kron

[Pre-Chorus]
Moonlight is lighting her face
(Lighting her face)
Down in the crypts of the Damned
Her sins will not be the last
(Not be the last)
When the rituals start
[Chorus]
Black candles burning
Announce her come back
The reign is awaiting
The queen of the dead... of the dead!

[Refrain]
Rosa nera sussurrante
Piange sangue d'innocenza
Dall'abisso lei ritorna
Per urlare la sentenza
[Spoken]
Oh, God... the passage is open
The souls of the damned are ready to cross it...
Godforsaken bitch...!
Your fucking army of dead will never be so powerful
To break the chains of wisdom... beware!

[Bridge]
My land don't cry
My birds don't stop to fly
Poor child don't die
Don't let her taste your blood

[Verse 3]
Gargoyles and wizards prepare this last ride
Mountains and valleys are calling your might
Mystical sunshines prelude to her coming
The black flame of evil is burning and growing
[Post-Chorus]
Queen... Queen Of The Dark Horizons!
Queen... Queen Of The Dark Horizons!

[Verse 4]
Forest of ghostland give your sad welcome
To the ancestral whisper of hell
Sodomy, pestilence, torture and bloodshed
Is what she brings from her past of depraved

[Post-Chorus]
Queen... Queen Of The Dark Horizons!
Queen... Queen Of The Dark Horizons!

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 5]
Her body is moving, her heart of bitch pounds
Is Kron who lives in her, in her open wounds
'Cause she was devoted to darkness
Drinking black blood for her god
Witch of perversion and luxury suicide
As true lover of Kron

[Pre-Chorus]
Moonlight is lighting her face
(Lighting her face)
Down in the crypts of the Damned
Her sins will not be the last
(Not be the last)
When the rituals start

[Chorus]
Black candles burning
Announce her come back
The reign is awaiting
The queen of the dead... of the (dead!)
Black candles burning
Announce her come back
The reign is awaiting
The queen of the dead... of the dead!
