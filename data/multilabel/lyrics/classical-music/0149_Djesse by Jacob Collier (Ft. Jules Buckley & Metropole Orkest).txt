Djesse has a sky like a merry-go-round
Making circles in a mind made of tapestry
And the world outside never seems to make a sound
So he lives inside his world full of majesty
Djesse close his eyes and sees the rain rise up
From the deep blue waters of infinity
He says, "I wish I knew the reason for the fire in my heart
But I can’t seem to tell you why it burns for me"

[Chorus]
Oh Djesse, won't you come back home (Back home)
(Oh, Djesse, won't you come back home)
Oh Djesse, won't you come back home (Back home, come back)
Come home

[Verse 2]
I said, "Djesse, you've been silent for your whole, whole life
How I wish I knew the world burning in your heart
I've been listening to the words and the kookaburra birds
But I can’t see the fire you've been singing of"
He said, "The moon’s so high and the water’s so wide
And you’re never gonna find what you're searching for
But deep inside you, there’s a world with a merry-go-round
Like a sky, such a fire you've never felt before"

Oh Djesse, won't you come back home (Back home)
(Oh, Djesse, won't you come back home)
Oh Djesse, won't you come back home (Come back, come back)
Come home

[Bridge]
Oh Djesse, set me free, set me free, set me free
Oh Djesse, set me free, let me be what you can be
Oh Djesse, set me free, set me free, set me free
Oh Djesse, set me free, let me be what you can be
Oh Djesse, set me free, set me free, set me free
Oh Djesse, set me free, let me be what you can be
Oh Djesse, set me free, set me free, set me free
Oh Djesse, set me free, let me be what you can be

[Outro]
Said, Djesse, close your eyes and be free
Djesse (Djesse, oh oh), be who you wanna be
Djesse (Djesse, oh oh), close your eyes and you'll see
(Djesse, Djesse, Djesse, oh, Djesse)
Djesse (Djesse, oh oh), be who you wanna be
(Djesse, Djesse, Djesse, Djesse, set me free)
Djesse (Djesse, oh oh), close your eyes and be free
(Djesse closed his eyes, sees the rain rise up)
Djesse (Djesse, oh oh), be who you wanna be
(Djesse knows the reason for the fire in my heart)
Oh Djesse, set me free, let me be who you can be
Djesse, close your eyes and be free
Oh Djesse, set me free, set me free, set me free
Djesse, be who you wanna be
Oh Djesse, set me free, let me be who I can be
