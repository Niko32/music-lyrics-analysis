Pedestal, kicked dirt in the faces of
All other life, crowned himself as deity
Crowned himself as deity

What animal separates this ape from that?
The human animal; Ignored and loathed by louse and lion
Ignored and loathed by louse and lion

Revel in our glory
In every brother is quarry
Butcher every life
Until our land is stained and dead

Hewn

From our towers we cry:
"Every man bear a soul
Every man shall
A right that no other beast shall bear"
And in the shadows, dogs shook their heads

"Shame upon those apes"

"Shame upon those apes, pride comes before a fall"
"Shame upon those apes, pride comes before a fall"
"Shame upon those apes, pride comes before a fall"
"Shame upon those apes, pride comes before a fall"
