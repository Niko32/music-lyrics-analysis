I got no wings to fly me, no song to sing me
No hand to hold me, no star to guide me
No tears to cry me, no fire to burn me
No sky above me, no Hell below me
No wind behind me, no path before me
No chains around me, no fear within me
But with the love in my heart, somehow I found you
But with the love in my heart, somehow I found you

[Verse 1]
He said "I need somebody understands my soul
Somebody to tell me where to go
And I don't wanna be traveling on my own"
She said, "I’ll be the one, let me come along"
He said, "Do you wanna dance with me, do you wanna dance?
I been sitting here too long
And my bones feel old, but my feet still young"
He said, "I've never met a girl I could hold so strong
I'm never gonna do you wrong
Now put your hands on me where they belong
And boogie with me all night long"
Boogie with me all night long
Baby, won’t you sing my song

[Verse 2]
She said, "I need somebody who can move my feet"
(Wiggle wiggle wiggle)
"Someone to make my heart beat
And I don't want you talking to me soft and sweet"
He said, "I'll be the one to make you feel complete"
She said, "Do you wanna sing with me, do you wanna sing?
I been talking here too long
How can your bones feel old with a voice so young?"
She said, "Djesse got a sky like a, a merry-go-round
But he don't ever make a sound
Now put your hands on me, baby, touch the ground
And give it to me up and down"

I got no wings to fly me, no song to sing me
No hand to hold me, no star to guide me
No breeze to blow me, no tears to cry me
No fire to burn me, no sea to sail me
No sky above me, no Hell below me
No wind behind me, no path before me
No place to hide me, no lost to find me
No chains around me, no fear within me
No wings to fly me, no song to sing me
No hand to hold me, no star to guide me
No breeze to blow me, no tears to cry me
No fire to burn me, no sea to sail me
No sky above me, no Hell below me
No wind behind me, no path before me
No place to hide me, no lost to find me
No chains around me, no fear within me
No wings to fly me, no song to sing me
No hand to hold me, no star to guide me
No breeze to blow me, no tears to cry me
No fire to burn me, no sea to sail me
No sky above me, no Hell below me
No wind behind me, no path before me
No place to hide me, no lost to find me
No chains around me, no fear within me

[Verse 3]
If I tell you all about it (Oh)
Would you tell me where to go?
And if all I know is nothing (Oh)
Would you tell me what I know?
If I tell you all about it (Tell me all about it)
Would you tell me where to go?
And if all I know is nothing (Tell them all about it)
Would you tell me what I know?
He said, "I need somebody make me lose control"

[Outro]
Keep in motion, stay unspoken
And if I'm broken, keep me open
Keep in motion (Keep in motion, keep in motion)
Stay unspoken (Stay unspoken, stay unspoken)
And if I'm broken (And if I'm broken, and if I'm broken)
Keep me open (Keep me open, keep me open)
Keep in motion (Keep in motion, keep in motion)
Stay unspoken (Stay unspoken, stay unspoken)
And if I’m broken (And if I’m broken, and if I'm broken)
Keep me open (Keep me open, keep me open)
