Here on the edge of the moon
Running from our future
As I look back, your heart grabs my hand asking me
To remember a vow you made that would always take
Me to the edge of the moon
Circling pictures of you

[Verse 2]
The time you sailed on
Under the diamond eye
Or for a dolphin who for a song had
Crossed night to bring back your bride
Under a warm Tuscan sun
No cliff was too steep for us
Here at the edge of the moon
I surf a curve thrown by you

[Verse 3]
And did you teach me to fly past your marmalade sky?
So that after the waning and waxing of love
You could find
Me at the edge
Here at the edge
Me at the edge of, the edge of the moon
You might also like[Interlude]

[Verse 4]
Now I'm going back, past that marmalade sky
'Cause you've got my waxing and waning
As primitive goes
You can stir the embers of the Lucy inside of my soul
Now I'm going back, past that marmalade sky
'Cause you've got my waxing and waning
As primitive goes
You can stir the embers of the Lucy inside of my soul
Now I'm going back, past that marmalade sky
'Cause you've got my waxing and waning
As primitive goes
You can stir the embers of the Lucy inside, the Lucy inside
Lucy inside of my soul
Stir the Lucy inside of my soul

[Outro]
Here at the edge
Me at the edge of, the edge of the moon
