Johnnie get your gun, get your gun, get your gun
Take it on the run, on the run, on the run
Hear them calling you and me
Every son of liberty

Hurry right away, no delay, go today
Make your daddy glad to have had such a lad
Tell your sweetheart not to pine
To be proud her boy's in line

[Chorus]
Over there, over there
Send the word, send the word over there
That the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

So prepare, say a prayer
Send the word, send the word to beware
We'll be over, we're coming over
And we won't come back 'til it's over over there

Over there, over there
Send the word, send the word over there
That the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming
The drums rum-tumming everywhere
You might also likeSo prepare, say a prayer
Send the word, send the word to beware
We'll be over, we're coming over
And we won't come back 'til it's over over there

[Verse 2]
Johnnie get your gun, get your gun, get your gun
Johnnie show the Hun you're a son of a gun
Hoist the flag and let her fly
Yankee Doodle do or die

Pack your little kit, show your grit, do your bit
Yankees to the ranks from the towns and the tanks
Make your mother proud of you
And the old Red, White and Blue

[Chorus]
Over there, over there
Send the word, send the word over there
That the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

So prepare, say a prayer
Send the word, send the word to beware
We'll be over, we're coming over
And we won't come back 'til it's over over there
Over there, over there
Send the word, send the word over there
That the Yanks are coming, the Yanks are coming
The drums rum-tumming everywhere

So prepare, say a prayer
Send the word, send the word to beware
We'll be over, we're coming over
And we won't come back 'til it's over over there
