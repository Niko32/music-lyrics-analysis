Even the shadows were crying
All was so sad on that tragic day
Their love was marred by one stupid war
And their holy flame will not burn anymore
But something seems to be not right
His cosmic heart wants to pound him
His soul is so full of love for his queen
And rage for the triumph of that bloody king

[Verse 2]
He'd like to change all that happened
The story so bad was written
He called the essence of cosmos itself
The stars in the end made a wonderful spell

[Chorus]
On silver wings he will fly
Beyond dark horizons
And crossing the oceans
Of space and time
He will find a new star
Another brave hero
A knight of immortal fire

[Bridge]
"I'll try to move planets and stars
To pound in your heart again
Beloved magic princess they now have to pay
And then we'll fly together"

[Chorus]
On silver wings he will fly
Beyond dark horizons
And crossing the oceans
Of space and time
He will find a new star
Another brave hero
A knight of immortal fire

[Outro]
"I'll try to move planets and stars
To pound in your heart again
Beloved magic princess they now have to pay
And then we'll fly together"
