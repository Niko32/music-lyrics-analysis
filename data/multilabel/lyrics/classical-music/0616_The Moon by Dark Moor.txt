[Refrain]
Full Moon in the height
Full Moon in the night
Influence of the Moon
Can make an artist or a loon of lovers
Full Moon in the height
Full Moon in the night
Spirit, like the Moon
Can be an expanded white balloon which hovers

[Bridge]
Life is a dream
When it reflects a gleam
That we catch as the essence
Which is hidden in the beam
Feel the Moon

[Pre-Chorus]
It is the daughter of mystic water
We hear the tune played by the light of the Moon
Intuition is condition to understand the moonlight
It means is clean
Mind (the Moon)
See (the Moon)
Feel (the Moon)
Love (the Moon)
Hear (the Moon)

Listen to the Moon!
Oh, listen to the Moon!
The Moon!

[Verse 1]
We are deceived by what's believed
Lies of the Moon our soul have strewn
Watching the other side, someone thinks
That is a mother what seemed a sphinx
The Moon deludes
The Moon is shrewd
The Moon misleads
The Moon obtrudes
The Moon inside!!!

[Refrain]
Full Moon in the height
Full Moon in the night
Fantasy fades soon when not supported
By the Moon in crescent
Full Moon in the height
Full Moon in the night
Fancies send the Moon and they are granted
As a boon or present
[Bridge]
Life is a dream
When it reflects a gleam
That we catch as the essence
Which is hidden in the beam
Feel the Moon

[Pre-Chorus]
It is the daughter of mystic water
We hear the tune played by the light of the Moon
Intuition is condition to understand the moonlight
It means is clean
Mind (the Moon)
See (the Moon)
Feel (the Moon)
Love (the Moon)
Hear (the Moon)

[Chorus]
Listen to the Moon!
Oh, listen to the Moon!
The Moon!

[Verse 2]
The calling of the Moon!
The calling of the Moon!
It is the moonlight?
(Moonlight)
Moonlight
(Moonlight)
Moonlight
(Moonlight)
Moonlight (light)
Moon (light), Moon (light)
Moon (light), Moon (light)
Moon (light), Moon (light)
Moon...
[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
Oh, the Moon serenade
Music played by the moonlight
The Moon in the morning must fade
At night can evermore rise
It is the night maid
In daytime disguise of morning, afraid!

[Refrain]
Full Moon in the height
Full Moon in the night
Influence of the Moon
Can make an artist or a loon of lovers

[Bridge]
Life is a dream
When it reflects a gleam
That we catch as the essence
Which is hidden in the beam
Feel the Moon

[Pre-Chorus]
It is the daughter of mystic water
We hear the tune played by the light of the Moon
Intuition is condition to understand the moonlight
It means is clean
Mind (the Moon)
See (the Moon)
Feel (the Moon)
Love (the Moon)
Hear (the Moon)
Listen to the Moon!

[Verse 4]
Within the silent night
We hear it's sounding light
It's music is the movement
Of emotions which are burning
In the sweetness of creation
Recreated by the magic force of love!
It's the motion of sensations
Returning to imagination
In the deepness resonated
By the magic of the (Moon)

[Verse 5]
It's the movement
(It's the motion)
Of emotions
(Of sensations)
They're burning
(They're returning)
Recreated by the magic
By the magic! By the (magic!) Of the
Burning by the magic
By the magic! By the magic of the Moon!
