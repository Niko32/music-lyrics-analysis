Long live our noble Queen!
God save the Queen!
Send her victorious
Happy and glorious
Long to reign over us
God save the Queen!

O Lord our God arise
Scatter her enemies
And make them fall
Confound their politics
Frustrate their knavish tricks
On thee our hopes we fix
God save us all!

The choicest gifts in store
On her be pleased to pour
Long may she reign!
May she defend our laws
And ever give us cause
To sing with heart and voice
God save the Queen!You might also like
