Got my reactions, they're automatic
And after all that I've been through
I project my fears on you

I've got my memories, places I've been
Like wooden fragments stuck in my skin
And after all that I've been through
Try to hide my scars from you

I don't want you to know
'Cause I don't, don't want you to go

Could you still love me with a splintered mind?
Could you still want me when you don't know what you might find?
Behind this shattered lens I see the world through
Coloring my thoughts, distorting my view
If I let you see what's broken inside of me
Could you still love me with a splintered mind?

Sometimes I get so stuck in my head
Sometimes I can't get out of my bed
This is just a side effect
You know I really want to connect

It's cracked and it's scarred
But I would, would give you my heart
You might also likeCould you still love me with a splintered mind?
Could you still want me when you don't know what you might find?
Behind this shattered lens I see the world through
Coloring my thoughts, distorting my view
If I let you see what's broken inside of me
Could you still love me with a splintered mind?

Will you take me as I am?
Would you catch me when I fall?
Could you take me as I am?
Will you catch me when I fall?

Could you still love me with a splintered mind?
Could you still want me when you don't know what you might find?
Behind this shattered lens I see the world through
Coloring my thoughts, distorting my view
If I let you see what's broken inside of me
Could you still love me with a splintered mind?
With a splintered mind

If the splinter ran deeper could you help me pull it out?
If the splinter ran deeper could you help me pull it out?
If the splinter ran deeper could you help me pull it out?
Oh, if the splinter ran deeper could you help me pull it out?
