To hold you close to your body
But I'd already gone
Once, you listened for someone
A voice to soothe your aching heart
And I told you goodbye

Time passes us by
Seems like our day is gone
But I know, in my heart, I’ll always care for you
And you'll care for me
And I will always remember the world we shared
The road may be long, long, long, long
But someday, I'll hold you close once more

Time passes us by
The sun in your eyes is gone
But I know, in my heart, I’ll always shine for you
And I will always remember the world we shared
The road may be long, long, long, long, long, long, long
But someday, I'll hold you close once more
I'll hold you, hold you once more, hold you once more
I'm gonna hold you, I'm gonna hold you, hold you
Hold you once again
The road may be long, the road may be long, long, long
Long, long, long
I'm gonna hold youYou might also like
