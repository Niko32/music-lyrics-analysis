A tale of all things yet to come
As it once was, so it shall be again
Modern day Children of the Sun

Seek the hidden rhyme and there you'll find
A new world order
Feel the mystery
So much to see through the eyes of hope

The Thoughts of Ma'at, forever secured -
Locked in the Ages
Goddess of Truth speaks eternally
From the depths of the pages

Seek the hidden words
As time unfolds you'll find the answers
Feel the mystery
Look to the Sea, under skies of Hope

What have we done? Can we right all the
Wrongs - the evils and fears, for thousands of
Years, that forever drain our vitality?
Can this go on without dire consequence?
Our tragic ways, the end of days that shadow
The dawn of eternity...
You might also likeHe's taken form in human - likeness
And manifests himself in all our darkest dreams
Preying upon centuries of weakness
Feasting on despair and our own selfish greed

Bow down to me - (we will never understand)
Then take my hand and you will see - (we'll see...)
You will see paradise - (a paradise?)
Of pain and death
Awaiting for you all - (we'll decide the future)

Lost evermore the essence of truth, although
She tried in vein to bring us peace, it will
Ever rest in our hands
We've cried a thousand tears for all we had
And all the things we could have been
We must find our way again

Fools who looks for answers in a rhyme
Seeking out a lie, an illusion
I am the future, the ageless mutation

Five beyond the skies align, Zeus to Ra
The final sign

My opposition's drawing near, feeding on his fear
Tasting anguish
I have the power - the ageless invasion
Five beyond the skies align, Zeus to Ra - the
Final sign
From the Messenger on Wings
Peace and war - a line of Kings...

Again the Titans clash on the edge of this
Earthen plane
Now from the depths they speak
Echoing from the wave
From the Waves...

Choose the way, five paths there for you to find
Turn the page, the question lies between the lines
Will we, will you...
Can we, can you, can we change?
