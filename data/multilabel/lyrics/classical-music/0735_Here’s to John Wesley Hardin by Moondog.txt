No man was quicker on the draw

Many men tried his meddle
And found it wasn´t wanting lead

Think of Jane when you judge him;
She loved and lost a wanted man

Gaming tables were turning
Against the man who learned the law

Wes the Winner was losing
To fall with bullets in his back

Bottoms up to a Texan
