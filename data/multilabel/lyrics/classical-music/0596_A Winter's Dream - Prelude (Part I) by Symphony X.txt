I can hear now, what you feel inside

The night is drawing closer
You feel you have to hide

Your fears are never wrong or right
Everything is either black or white

It's time to close your eyes now
Begin your fantasy - what does it mean?
Wake your dreams (commence now...)
Into reality

Your fears are never wrong or right
Everything is either black or white

In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you
