She’s in me, her being, her will to live
Damned to breathe and feel that source of sin
One pure fate, true love devoured by hate
Her last pain, dark trace of pulsing shade

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Veiled in the mist of a sad winter night
A lonely ghost in a fragment of light
Icy vibration, a whisper, a cold word
(Mortal darkened deadly sorrow)

[Chorus]
Divina amata or sospirata
I’ll cross the Hell on Earth to have your soul back
Irato averno, Dante’s inferno
I need your grace to be my pain in nomine
Divina amata or sospirata
I’ll cross the Hell on Earth to have your soul back
Irato averno, Dante’s inferno
I need your grace to be my pain in nomine

[Verse 2]
Freeze, black wind, my nights, my empty dreams
Back from lies I am her sacrifice
She’s in me, her being, her will to live
Damned to breathe and feel that source of sin
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
One melancholic reflection of grey
A walking dead with your heart in his hands
Come and reveal all the might of your shadow
(Through your gothic vivid splendour)

[Chorus]
Divina amata or sospirata
I’ll cross the Hell on Earth to have your soul back
Irato averno, Dante’s inferno
I need your grace to be my pain in nomine
Divina amata or sospirata
I’ll cross the Hell on Earth to have your soul back
Irato averno, Dante’s inferno
I need your grace to be my pain in nomine

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Divina amata or sospirata
I’ll cross the Hell on Earth to have your soul back
Irato averno, Dante’s inferno
I need your grace to be my pain in nomine
Divina amata or sospirata
I’ll cross the Hell on Earth to have your soul back
Irato averno, Dante’s inferno
I need your grace to be my pain in nomine
[Outro]
Pain in nomine
Divina amata or sospirata
