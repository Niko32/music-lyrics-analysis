Lost star whisperer
Where, where, where have you gone?
Lost star whisperer
Will your cloud riders come?
Why, why have you locked up your sky?
Night sky, whisper me back to life

[Verse]
Night warns of an eastern threat
North calls reinforcements from the west
Lost all reason guarded by the wise
Sing to life the Seven Lords of Time

[Chorus 2]
Lost star whisperer
Send for your Cloud Riders to come
Why, why have you locked up your sky?
Night sky, whisper me back to life

[Refrain]
Then I heard you scream
From the other side of the mountain
I saw a "you" I didn't want to see
I heard you scream
From the other side of the mountain
You might also like[Interlude]

[Refrain]
Then I heard you scream
From the other side of the mountain
You saw a "me" I didn't want to see
I heard you scream
From the other side of the mountain

[Chorus 3]
Lost star whisperer
Where, where, where have you gone?
Forged of fire and song
You warn hate shadows love
Why, why have you locked up your sky?
Night sky, whisper me back to life
