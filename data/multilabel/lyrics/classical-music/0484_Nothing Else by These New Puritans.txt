Path through clouds
But tied in knots (To hide the light inside)
Is there a prayer that just for a moment
Real life and dreaming swap places?

[Refrain: Elisa Rodrigues]
Nothing else but this

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: Jack Barnett]
Drift like feathers down beneath the rolling waves

[Outro: Elisa Rodrigues & Jack Barnett, Both]
A prayer that just for a minute
Nonsense and meaning swap places
Nothing else but thisYou might also like
