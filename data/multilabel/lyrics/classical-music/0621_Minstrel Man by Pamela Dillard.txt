Because my mouth is wide with laughter
And my throat is deep with song
You do not think I suffer
After I have held my pain so long

[Verse 2]
Because my mouth is wide with laughter
You do not hear my inner cry
Because my feet are gay with dancing
You do not know I die
You do not know I dieYou might also like
