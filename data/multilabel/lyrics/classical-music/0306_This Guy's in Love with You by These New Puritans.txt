Who looks at you the way I do?
Tell me now, but don't tell me
Know each other very well

My heart's racing to love
I need your love
Say you're in love, in love
With this guy
If not, I'll just die

You say this guy's in love with you
Who looks at you the way I do?
Tell me now, but don't tell me
Know each other very well
