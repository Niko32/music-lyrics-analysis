Rogue crusaders, empty prayers
Abandoned by their Lord Creator
Minds enslaved by corporations
Souls encaged in desperation

[Chorus]
Break the chains of your despair
They don’t like us, we don’t care
Break the chains of your despair
They don’t like us, we don’t care

[Verse 2]
Out of darkness we arise
Brothers, sisters: side by side
Burning every bridge we cross
Taking back the life we lost

[Chorus]
Break the chains of your despair
They don’t like us, we don’t care
Break the chains of your despair
They don’t like us, we don’t care

[Verse 3]
Striking fear into their hearts
Obey no more, in God we trust
Salute the angels in the sky
Let the masses hear our cries
You might also like[Chorus]
Break the chains of your despair
They don’t like us, we don’t care
Break the chains of your despair
They don’t like us, we don’t care
