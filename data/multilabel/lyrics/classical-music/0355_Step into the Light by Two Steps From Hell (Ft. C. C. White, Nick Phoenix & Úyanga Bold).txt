Blackout, a night that paints new cold
Shadows moving with the wind
The world turned in
And I follow
And they say that no one is to blame
And Nero walked into the flame
Burned to black
And I see him watching darkness walking

Step into the light
Make your presence known
We can break the ice
And I am here alone
Step into the light


Whispers that bathe themselves in gin
To the brim
'Til the old road is flooded
Promises burn

I hold no cross and I pay no toll
This with my wings on fire
To a place far beyond the dropped-down sky
Impossible to find
Step into the light
Step into the light
Step into the light
You might also likeStep into the light darkened souls
Fill my heart with hate and hoax
Beyond the gate the silence roars
The solemn wind of a thousand wars
Step into the light
