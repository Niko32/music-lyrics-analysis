My knees are shaking, my hands are numb
All the words I had in my head are gone
I ring your doorbell and you take too long
'Cause you already know there's something wrong

[Chorus]
But don't hate me when I say this
I know it might be hard
And I don't know where to start
I'm gonna hurt you, but I have to
There's no better words to say
That I don't love you that way
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

[Verse 2]
You're looking down to find something to say
You look at me and I look away
You say you'll love me forever
I say that time will prove you wrong
'Cause how I used to feel is gone

[Chorus]
So don't hate me when I say this
I know it might be hard
And I don't know where to start
I'm gonna hurt you, but I have to
There's no better words to say
That I don't love you that way
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

[?] I remember when
We said we'd never let it end, oh
And you say this was a lie
Would you rather that I pretend
I feel the same as I did then?
I don't wanna lie, anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore

[Chorus]
So don't hate me
You won't make me change my mind
I know it might be hard
But I don't know where to start
I'm gonna hurt you, but I have to
There's no better words to say
That I don't love you that way
Anymore, anymore, anymore, anymore
