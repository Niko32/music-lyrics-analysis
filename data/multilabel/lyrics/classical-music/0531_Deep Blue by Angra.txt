Three cliffs there stand
High above where high winds howl
Surrounding silence
Three birds climb, then turn to fall

[Chorus]
Waiting for someday when the ocean and sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
- Should I always be the same once again?

[Verse 2]
Take my hand and follow
Sweeping trees, the coats of green
Time has no place tomorrow
Feel the God in endless dreams

[Chorus]
Waiting for someday when the ocean and sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
- Should I close my eyes and pray?
- Always be the same once again?

[Latin Bridge]
Benedictus qui venit
Domine Deus gloriae
Dominus recte
(Benedictus qui venit)
Sociis propter tuum pertinax
(Domine Deus gloriae)
Alte paelex mox tui
(Dominus recte)
Vindex persona ad lucis
(Benedictus qui venit)
Cuncta assula miles
(Domine Deus gloriae)
Mox ad maestae pro lucis
(Dominus recte)
Ad mortal esse lux
(Benedictus qui venit)
Lux formas tua producis
(Domine Deus gloriae)
Ad lumis ad formus
(Dominus recte)

Waiting for someday when the ocean and sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
- Should I close my eyes and pray?
- Feel like I've betrayed?
- Always be the same again?

[Guitar Solo]

[Outro]
Now that I am waiting for the day when the ocean and the sky
Will cover up the land in deep blue
Renaissance is over and I wonder:
- Should I always be the same once again?
