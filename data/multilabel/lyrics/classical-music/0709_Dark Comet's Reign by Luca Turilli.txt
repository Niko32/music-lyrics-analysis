Oooooo-o-ooooooh, o-ooooooh
Oooooo-o-ooooooh, o-ooooooh

[Verse 1]
And so unexpected came that sad mystic day
No words could have told what now was happening
It fell down quaking the Zaephyr's surface
Blinding the eyes of a thousand dying men
Who were looking at it falling right over them
What seemed to be an astral fireball
Was hurling metal, a dark and giant starship
Colliding with Zaephyr's volcanic grey rocks
Grey rocks!

[Chorus]
Space and time (Oooooo-o-ooooooh)
Burn in the skies (O-ooooooh)
Dark comet's ride (Comet's ride)
Keep your faith (Oooooo-o-ooooooh)
The day it came (O-ooooooh)
Dark comet's reign
Dark comet's reign!

O-o-o-o-o-o-o-ooooo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oooooh
O-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oooooooh

[Verse 2]
After a long day
They reached the central hall
No trace of bodies
Only computers' voice
All seems so strange in that mysterious ship
Where are the people?
Could there be some survivors?
No life but there are real feelings of death
Suddenly mournful cries echo all around
There's one young girl hidden in the farthest corner
She's shocked and afraid but at least she's alive
Alive!

[Chorus]
Space and time (Oooooo-o-ooooooh)
Burn in the skies (O-ooooooh)
Dark comet's ride (Dark comet)
Keep your faith (Oooooo-o-ooooooh)
The day it came (O-ooooooh)
Dark comet's reign
Dark comet's reign!
[Bridge]
Alles, alles
Alles, alles
Alles nur nach Gottes Willem
So bei Lust als, als Traurigkeit

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Space and time (Oooooo-o-ooooooh)
Burn in the skies (O-ooooooh)
Dark comet's ride (Comet's ride)
Keep your faith (Oooooo-o-ooooooh)
The day it came (O-ooooooh)
Dark comet's reign
Dark comet's reign!

[Outro]
Alles, alles
Alles, alles
Alles nur nach Gottes Willen
So bei Lust als, als Traurigkeit
