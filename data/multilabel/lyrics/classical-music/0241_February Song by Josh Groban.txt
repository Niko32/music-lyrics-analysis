Where has that old friend gone
Lost in a February song?
Tell him it won't be long
'Til he opens his eyes
Opens his eyes

[Verse 2]
Where is that simple day
Before colors broke into shades?
And how did I ever fade into this life
Into this life?

[Chorus]
And I never want to let you down
Forgive me if I slip away
When all that I've known is lost and found
I promise you, I
I'll come back to you one day

[Verse 3]
Morning is waking up
And sometimes it's more than just enough
When all that you need to love
Is in front of your eyes
It's in front of your eyes
You might also like[Chorus]
And I never want to let you down
Forgive me if I slip away
Sometimes it's hard to find my ground
'Cause I keep on falling
As I try to get away from this crazy world

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
And I never want to let you down
Forgive me if I slip away
When all that I've known is lost and found
I promise you, I
I'll come back to you one day

[Outro]
Where has that old friend gone
Lost in a February song?
Tell him it won't be long
'Til he opens his eyes
Opens his eyes
