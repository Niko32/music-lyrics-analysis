As the day gave way to nautical twilight
I turned my back on the force of which I knew
I abandoned it, rupturing a delicate balance
When I left my world for his

[Chorus 1]
Day after day, as my city fades
And is swallowed by his sea
And she is boundless
Even breaking on the beach

[Verse 2]
Every alchemist knows fusion and fission
Can unify or drive a force to split
He has been possessed
To drink of the spices from the east by his liquid mistress
Which then pushed me into the lair of uranium
She divides time between greed and his twin tyranny

[Chorus 2]
Day after day, cities are betrayed
And the earthy sons lay their blame
And she is boundless
But by then she has been frayed
You might also like[Outro]
As the night gives way to nautical dawn
I can see I must activate the force of which I am made
