Watch them be disposed
Daybreak
The veil is off
Rings of martyrs
Taking back souls in the crackdown
There's no way to you

[Verse 2]
Watch them recompose
To breath of man
Brings the horses through the skies now
There's no quarrel
The age of fires
Ice snow
Ice snow

[Chorus]
It was never a selection
It's the collection of bones that relay
Windows as broken and haunted
The roll of her fans
The rushing of waves
The coursing of her story
The wings of both glory
And the return quarries
Leave behind your all
You're who the waves are roaring forYou might also like
