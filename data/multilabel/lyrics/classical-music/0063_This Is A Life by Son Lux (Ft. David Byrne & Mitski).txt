Ooh
Ooh

[Chorus 1: Mitski]
This is a life
Free from destiny
Not only what we sow
Not only what we show (We)

[Chorus 2: Mitski, David Byrne, Both]
This is a life (Every possibility)
Free from destiny (I choose you, and you choose me)
Not only what we sow (Every space and every time)
Not only what we show, we (We, ooh)

[Verse 1: Mitski, David Byrne, Both]
This is a light (Many lives that could've been)
Free from entropy (Entangled for eternity)
Not only hands and toes
Not only what we've known

[Bridge: Both]
We find this life (Sucked into a bagel)
Somehow alright
You might also like[Verse 2: Both]
This is a life
Slow and sudden miracles
View of other worlds from our window sills
With the weight of et–µrnity at the speed of light

[Outro: Both]
This is a life
This is our life
