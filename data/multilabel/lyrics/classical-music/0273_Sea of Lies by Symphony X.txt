[Verse 1]
Today I've seen the shallow face I wear
Inside this shell a living hell endures
I'm held captive by my fear
Decaying hope and wasted years
The knife of time carves another line around these eyes

[Chorus]
Good and evil
Lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of lies
Lies

[Verse 2]
Losing faith in who I am
Never changing, just rearranging my life again
Through eternal abyss I fall
Silent screams through paper walls
I pray someday the sun will shine on me again
Shine on me again

[Chorus]
Good and evil
Lust primeval
Dragging me into a sea of lies
Lies
