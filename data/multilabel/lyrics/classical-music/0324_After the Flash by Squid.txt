You've been searching for this
Just a little normal
I've been doing the dishes
Playing parlour games

[Refrain]
Your smile fades
Quicker than it's made
Sometimes
Sometimes

[Verse 2]
After the flash
All the panel hosts
They stay hydrated
And they tell me jokes
Staring into the stalls
All demonic faces
They lap me up
They spit me out
Just lap me up
Don't spit me out

[Refrain]
My smile fades
Quicker than it's made
My smile fades
Quicker than it's made
Sometimes
Sometimes

[Verse 3]
Oh, parlour games
My closest friends
Smile from ear to ear
How hard can it be
To live a normal life?
Or make a nation cry?

[Outro]
Oh, parlour games
Oh, parlour games
Oh, parlour games
Oh, parlour games
Could I keep it up?
Could I keep it up?
Could I keep it up?
Could I keep it up?
Could I keep it up?
Could I keep it up?
Could I keep it up?
