Once upon a time, a phrase
That had once had me filled with rapture
But it doesn't guarantee
A happily ever after
Will you then accept your fate
Or fight it before it's too late
Trying to reclaim what's mine
Regardless of the greater design

[Pre-Chorus]
And on this stage, we arabesque
To try and turn the page
Echoing inside your heart
It tells you how to play your part
So can you break from your cage?

[Chorus]
Fight fate, or see it through
Who could I be and who are you?
Trying to see what's true
So will you join me in a pas de deux?
So fight fate, or see it through
Is destiny worth clinging to?
All that I want is you
So will you join me in a pas de deux?

They say, the tales we spin
Are not yet pre-ordained
And yet if we break free
All we're met with is another new chain
Still comprehending
Is it really a lie, who I am inside?
Still just pretending
That we cannot shy from prophecies we don't abide

[Pre-Chorus]
On the stage, you pirouette
To turn fortune assauge
Calling out into the end
So maybe I can find a friend
Then can we break from this cage

[Chorus]
Fight fate, or see it through
Who could I be and who are you?
Trying to see what's true
So will you join me in a pas de deux?
So fight fate, or see it through
Is destiny worth clinging to?
All that I want is you
So will you join me in a pas de deux?
Fight fate, or see it through
Who could I be and who are you?
Trying to see what's true
So will you join me in a pas de deux?
[Bridge]
Do you still remember
The fairytales we used to tell ourselves
Holding on to hope that one day
We could finally be free from these spells
Writing endless refrains
Trying to capture what was long ago
But what would it mean if we could finally let go?

Don't stop the narrative
And don't stop the ryhme
The pacing's imperative when it's showtime
Knowing the role you have, what do you plea?
Seek happiness or seek glory?

[Chorus]
Fight fate, or see it through
Is destiny worth clinging to?
All that I want is you
So will you join me in a pas de deux?
Fight fate, or see it through
(Keep yearning, turning for what can't be)
Who could I be and who are you?
(What is it you seek?)
Trying to see what's true
(Happiness or glory?)
So will you join me in a pas de deux?
