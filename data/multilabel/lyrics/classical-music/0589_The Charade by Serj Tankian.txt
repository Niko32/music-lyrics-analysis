I do believe, you were strong in forming violence
We are strong performing silence
I do believe, you were strong in forming violence
We are strong performing silence

[Pre-Chorus]
We are deceived, you're the toys of our convenience
Opening our hearts to the brilliance
We are deceived, you're the toys of our convenience
Opening our hearts to the brilliance

[Chorus]
Love is strong, hearing as loud as gunfire away
We're never wrong, constantly dreaming of another way
If love is wrong, go ahead and end the world with your charades
Never wrong, constantly dreaming of another way

[Verse]
I do believe, you were strong in forming violence
We are strong performing silence
I do believe, you were strong in forming violence
We are strong performing silence

[Pre-Chorus]
We are deceived, you're the toys of our convenience
Opening our hearts to the brilliance
We are deceived, you're the toys of our convenience
Opening our hearts to the brilliance
You might also like[Chorus]
Love is strong, hearing as loud as gunfire away
We're never wrong, constantly dreaming of another way
If love is wrong, go ahead and end the world with your charades
We're never wrong, constantly dreaming of another, 'nother
Another, another day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day

[Bridge]
Find me a red bag, one without a tag
Hope that you are near, valiantly appear
Find me a red bag, one without a tag
Hope that you are near, valiantly appear

Na, na, na, na, na-na-na-na-na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na

[Chorus]
Love is strong, hearing as loud as gunfire away
We're never wrong, constantly dreaming of another way
If love is wrong, go ahead and end the world with your charades
We're never wrong, constantly dreaming of another, 'nother
Another, another day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day, day
[Outro]
Find me a red bag, one without a tag
Hope that you are near, valiantly appear
Find me a red bag
