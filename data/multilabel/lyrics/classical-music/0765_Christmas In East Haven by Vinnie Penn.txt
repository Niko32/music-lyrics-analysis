City Sidewalks
Busy sidewalks
Girls with hair out ta there
They got trees on the polls
In east haven
(What are you talking about?)

Guys name Vinny
Got the skinny
On what suits they should wear (Hey its Armani)
And above all the Camaros'
Ya hear

[Chorus]
Silver Bells
All those smells (Its Eternity)
It's Christmas time in East Haven

All that gold
Gettin' old
Soon it will be Christmas day

[Verse 2]
Cousin Lori
S'got a story
That she can't wait to tell
So she talks on the phone
To Gina
You might also likeBobby's cheatin'
He needs a beatin'
'Cause he stole Louie's girl
And above all the cursing
Ya hear

[Chorus]
Silver Bells
Hair ol' Gel-ed
It's Christmas Time in East Haven

Ring-a-ling
Bada-bing
What's cha bring? (I brought my Brashall, okay) Hey
Soon it will be Christmas day
(You know what I mean?)

[Verse 3]
Mikey's bookin'
Mama's cookin'
Christmas Eve with the fish
As were all gettin' ready
For dinner

Christmas shoppin'
The place is hoppin'
Try to find one more gift
And above all the bustle
You hear
[Chorus]
Silver bells
Silver bells
It's Christmas time in east haven

I'm a family man
You understand
Soon it will be Christmas day

[Outro]
Hey, have a good Christmas, okay
Do the right thing, alright
