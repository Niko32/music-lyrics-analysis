Are bought and sold, but I'm not of it

I'm in the world where Peace and War
Are bargained for, but I'm not of it

I'm in the world where Money talks
To Doves and Hawks, but I'm not of it

I'm in the world where Kith and Kin
Are Moving in, but I'm not of it

I'm in the world where Thought Control
Is taking toll, but I'm not of it

I'm in the world where Jokers Make -
Believe the Fake, but I'm not of it

I'm in the world where Lies are Flies
That fill the Skies, but I'm not of it

I'm in the world where Boom and Bust
Are both a must, but I'm not of it

I'm in the world where Law is Force
A Trojan Horse, but I'm not of it
You might also likeI'm in the world where Good and Bad
Are iron-clad, but I'm not of it

I'm in the world where Pride in Race
Is losing Face, but I'm not of it

I'm in the world where Talk is cheap
And Isms creep, but I'm not of it

I'm in the world where Truth is what
If not a Plot, but I'm not of it

I'm in the world where Death is worth
As much as Birth, but IÂ´m not of it
