I get lost sometimes
When my work won't grab me
From the pull of the outside world
And there's a song we sing
That leaves us always burnin'
For them things we've yet to find
Singing

[Pre-Chorus]
We won't stop believing
We'll be young always
We know when it's time to be working on a twelve pack
Instead of nine to five

[Chorus]
And nine to five gives us the fuel for the ride
As we cruise through this life past them speed limit signs
We've seen a few drunken nights and some stories unfold
Set down the stress and replace with a brew
Don't quit your day job but take a few breaks
Not just for sleep or for sanity's sake
But for waters uncharted and the good friends of old
For the love of the ladies, and the bullshit we've sold
Put down them papers, empty those minds
Turn up the music it's time to unwind
I got some time on my side and the world to see
It's just a few of my friends and the song that we sing
Sing it
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
We won't stop believing
We will be young always
We know when it's time to be working on a twelve pack
Instead of nine to five

[Verse 2]
And I am found sometimes
When my reason leaves me
Taken over by the outside world
And there's a song we sing
That leaves us always yearnin'
For them things that we've yet-yet to find, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
We won't stop believing
We will be young always
We know when it's time to be working on a twelve pack
Instead of nine to five

[Chorus]
And nine to five gives us the fuel for the ride
As we cruise through this life past them speed limit signs
We've seen a few drunken nights and some stories unfold
Set down the stress and replace with a brew
Don't quit your day job but take a few breaks
Not just for sleep or for sanity's sake
But for waters uncharted and the good friends of old
For the love of the ladies and the bullshit we've sold
Put down them papers, empty those minds
Turn up the music it's time to unwind
I got some time on my side and the world to see
It's just a few of my friends and the song that we sing
Sing it
[Post-Chorus]
We won't stop believing
We will be young always
We know when it's time to be working on a twelve pack
Instead of nine to five

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
We won't stop believing
We will be young always
We know when it's time to be working on a twelve pack
Instead of nine to five
