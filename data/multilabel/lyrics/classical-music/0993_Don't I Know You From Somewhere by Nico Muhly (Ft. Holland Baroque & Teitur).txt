If I were a sushi roll
Traversing through a Japanese kitchen
I would be mostly fascinated
By the people there
Their welcoming arms
And their strange voices
Their fingers flying around
Immersed in conversation
I would like to ask them a question

[Refrain]
"Don't I know you from somewhere?"
"Don’t I know you from somewhere?"
"Don't I know you from somewhere?"

[Verse 2]
They would be too busy to answer me
Too hungry and happy with their lives
Busy soaking up the atmosphere
And this restaurant with pictures of slinky fish
On the wall
The sharp sound of knives
And the smell of soy and ginger
Still in their nostrils
You might also like[Verse 3]
I would be in awe of their breath
Their breath, their breath
I could hardly wait
To be lifted into their mouths
And get broken in two
And lie there melting
Somewhere between
The sadness of their tongue and teeth

[Refrain]
"Don't I know you from somewhere?"
"Don’t I know you from somewhere?"
"Don't I know you from somewhere?"
