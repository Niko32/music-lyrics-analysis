Who counts the seconds in between our pain?
Who knew that love was like a dying game?
Who counts the seconds in between our shame?

I know, I saw God
With a halo and a handgun
Oh, I saw love as the blueprint in the handbook
Oh, I saw you in a memory
And all of my questions were answered

Waiting for yesterday
Waiting for yesterday

Falling, I’m flying
I’m dreaming, I’m dying
Oh, darling, without you I’m falling
I’m flying, I’m dreaming, I’m dying
Oh, darling, without you I’m falling
I’m flying, I’m dreaming, I’m dying
Oh, darling, without you I’m falling
I’m flying, I’m dreaming, I’m dying
Oh, darling, without you
I’m waiting for yesterday
Waiting for yesterday

Falling, I’m flying
