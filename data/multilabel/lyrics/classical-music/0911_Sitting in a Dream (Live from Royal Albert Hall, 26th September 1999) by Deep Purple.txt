I'm just passing time before the Ball
Playing my guitar
I don't have to be where I don't want to be at all
Maybe I'll go far

[Chorus]
Going nowhere, sitting in a dream...
Ah, in a dream

[Verse 2]
Sitting in a landscape full of sighs
Dream away the day
Making up a tune about the blueness of the skies
This is where I'll stay

[Chorus]
I'm going nowhere, sitting in a dream...
Ah, in a dream

[Verse 3]
Watching as a red and white balloon
Sails across my mind
In between the images that drift along my tune
Smile as they unwind
You might also like[Chorus]
Going nowhere, sitting in a dream...
Ah, in a dream
