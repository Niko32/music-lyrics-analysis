Far across the land
There I’ll find my home
If you’ll take my hand
Guide me as I roam

[Verse 1]
I have walked a thousand miles
To find where I belong
Searched the world and all its isles
But still I wander on…

[2nd Mini Chorus]
Far across the land
Waiting there for me
All I ever planned
Just as I had dreamed

[Verse 2]
I’ve been lost for far too long
I need to find my way
Trying hard to carry on
But still feel far away

[Chorus]
Far across the land
There I’ll find my home
If you’ll take my hand
Guide me as I roam
Far across the land
Waiting there for me
All I ever planned
Just as I had dreamed
You might also like[Verse 3]
Give me strength to believe
When I’m losing faith
Help me past the darkness
In my mind

[Chorus]
Far across the land
There I’ll find my home
If you’ll take my hand
Guide me as I roam
Far across the land
Waiting there for me
All I ever planned
Just as I had dreamed
