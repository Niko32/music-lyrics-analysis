Lower my gaze, and hurry, full of dread
Suddenly, silently, you still might rise
And I would have to gaze on all your grief
With my own eyes
While you demand your happiness, that's dead
I know, you walk beyond me, every night
With a coy footfall, in a wretched dress
And walk for money, looking miserable!
Your shoes gather God knows what ugly mess
The wind plays in your hair with lewd delight—
You walk, and walk, and find no home at all

Trees where you sit
Shall crowd into a shade
Trees where you sit
Shall crowd into a shade

Wherе'er you tread
The blushing flowеrs shall rise
And all things flourish
And all things flourish
Where'er you turn your eyes
Where'er you turn your eyes

I walk so often, late, along the streets
Lower my gaze, and hurry, full of dread
Suddenly, silently, you still might rise
And I would have to gaze on all your grief
With my own eyes
While you demand your happiness, that's dead
I know, you walk beyond me, every night
With a coy footfall, in a wretched dress
And walk for money, looking miserable!
Your shoes gather God knows what ugly mess
The wind plays in your hair with lewd delight—
You walk, and walk, and find no home at allYou might also like
