Listen to me, sister, I got news from the governor
And he's heard people shouting from the towers in the city
While their babies grow in test tubes over night

[Verse 2]
Run and fetch the priest, 'cause there's a light on in the building
And there's sounds blowin' out in the music of the night
And we should try to get the people out alive

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 3]
Movin' 'cross the ocean with the flag of death a-flyin'
And the demon butcher pointin' out the message on the tide
And the demon light a-sailin' by his side

[Verse 4]
Stormin' down the airwaves comes the protest and the prayin'
And the love that shone down from the sun to the world
No longer could support the life it gaveYou might also like
