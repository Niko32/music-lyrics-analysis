[Verse 1]
Again, I see you standing there watching me
Your gaze, those eyes are tantalizing openly
Inviting me to get close to you
Can't help myself
There's fascination in the air

[Verse 2]
I try to fight this strong sensation
But there's no chance to escape from this temptation
Feels like I've known you before
Repeating phrases
But I yearn for something more

[Chorus]
I know I can't stay
By your side forever
But I know I won't forget
Your beauty
My black diamond

I know I can't stay
By your side forever
But I know I won't forget
Your beauty
My black diamond
I know I can't stay
By your side forever
But I know I won't forget
Your beauty
My black diamond

[Outro]
I can't forget
But I can't stay
By your side
