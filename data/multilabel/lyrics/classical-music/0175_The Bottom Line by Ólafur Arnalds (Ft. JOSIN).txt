It's all or nothing
No warning
A one wake up
A one wake up

When you're called back

Open your eyes
Become or be lost
Suck it all up
The one last shot
The one last shot

Covered by rats
That cover your tracks
The one wake up
How to go back?

Come on, come on
Be the water
Be all or nothing
When you sink back
In a vast ocean
Cut it all open inside
Curl yourself up and
Cry your bones dry
