We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
Keep smiling through
Just like you always do
'Til the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away

[Pre-Chorus]
So will you please say "Hello" to the folks that I know
Tell them I won't be long
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go
I was singing this song

[Chorus]
We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day

[Verse]
We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
Keep smiling through
Just like you always do
'Til the blue skies drive the dark clouds far away
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So will you please say "Hello" to the folks that I know
Tell them I won't be long
They'll be happy to know that as you saw me go
I was singin' this song

[Chorus]
We'll meet again
Don't know where, don't know when
But I know we'll meet again some sunny day
