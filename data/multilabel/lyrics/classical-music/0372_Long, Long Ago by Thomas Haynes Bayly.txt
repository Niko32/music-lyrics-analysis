Long, long ago, long, long ago
Sing me the songs I delighted to hear
Long, long ago, long ago

Now you are come all my grief is removed
Let me forget for how long you have roved
Let me believe that you love as you loved
Long, long ago, long ago

Do you remember the path where we met
Long, long ago, long, long ago
Ah yes, you told me you ne'er forgеt
Long, long ago, long ago

Then, to all others, my smile you prеferred
Love, when you spoke, gave a charm to each word
Still my heart treasures the praises I heard
Long, long ago, long agoYou might also like
