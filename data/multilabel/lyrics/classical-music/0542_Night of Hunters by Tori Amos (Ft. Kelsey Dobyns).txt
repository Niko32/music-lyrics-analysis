Rose so red, this night of hunters
Find love instead of their blood by your thorn
Rose so red, this night of hunters
Find love instead of their blood by my thorn

[Verse 2: Kelsey Dobyns & Tori Amos]
Dark forces are out there gathering
Dark forces are out there gathering
Some hunt for power, others to invade children's dreams
Some hunt for power, others to invade children's dreams

[Verse 3: Kelsey Dobyns & Tori Amos]
They must pay this night of hunters
Find love instead of their blood by your thorn
Find love instead of their blood by my thorn

[Chorus 1: Kelsey Dobyns, Tori Amos and Kelsey Dobyns & Tori Amos]
Holy Father, why not ask forgiveness from the Land?
Spirit to spirit, end this suffering
Spirit to spirit, soul to soul
They stole the dreams
Of the children by distorting what love means

[Bridge: Kelsey Dobyns & Tori Amos]
Watching over, keeping watch
Watching over, keeping watch
Watching over
Keeping watch over children's dreams
The ancient seven sisters above
Tuning the frequency
Keeping watch, watching over
Keeping watch over children's dreams
The ancient seven sisters above
Changing the frequency
Watching over, keeping watch
Watching over, watching over
Keeping watch over children's dreams
The ancient seven sisters above
Turning the frequency
Keeping watch, watching over
Keeping watch

Holy Father, you ask forgiveness from the land
Sacred Mother, you are released from your chains
Spirit to spirit, the children's dreams
Must now be reclaimed
Spirit to spirit, changing the frequency
Spirit to spirit, soul to soul
