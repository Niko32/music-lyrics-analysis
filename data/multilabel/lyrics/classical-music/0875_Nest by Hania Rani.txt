My tiny nest is filled from dreams I dreamt a thousand miles from here
I decide to trust the wind and lay my head down between the trees
Seeking silent shades of black
The sound, the moon is by my side
Tonight just let it go, and chant a little song
Alone

I sing alone, I sing alone
I sing a- (sing a-)
I sing alone, I sing alone
I sing a-, I sing a-
I sing alone, I sing alone (I sing alone)
I sing alone, I sing alone
I sing aloneYou might also like
