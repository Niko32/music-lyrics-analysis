I Don't Know You
I Just Don't Know You

(Verse 1: Sparkadiss)
Nurse Stop And Listen
Just Pay Attention
To What I'm Wishing
Cuz After I'm Done Spitting
What I Have Written
You'll Be Pimping
Gonna Be A Player
Got To Get This Paper
Gonna Smoke On This Vapor
Just Work Up The Nerves
And Talk To Her
And Ask Her About Her Day
Here Is Really
Exactly What To Say
You Can Forever In The Day
Let Me Take You Away
And When It Ends Always Be Your Friend
Buy Her A Drink, C'mon Man
You Don't Need To Think
Keep Her On Her Toes
Get Her To The Brink
Daydreaming About Her Still
That's How You Know
To Go In For The Kill
Excitements All About The Thrill
It Doesn't Hurt To Flash A Bill
You Don't Have Too
And That's Real
Give And Take
Play The Stakes
It's What Makes Us Great
Let Them Override The System
Cuz The Emotions Get The Best Of You
Just Stay True
Do What It Do

I Don't Know You
I Don't Know You
I Don't Know You
I Just Don't Know You
I Don't Know You

(Verse 2: Sparkadiss)
When You First Start
Woman Are A Work Of Art
So It's Bullshit To Call Yourself
A Pick Up Artist
Cuz You Melted Her Heart
That Had To Be The Hardest
They're The Arrow And You're Just The Target
Make You're Self Available Open For The Market
Humor Works Most Of The Time
Yo May Have To Stand And Wait In Line
Compliments Will Get You Further
You See A Ring Don't Even Bother
When It Comes To Money, Be The Godfather
Patterns And Design
Make Her Feel Like She Needs To Shine
Send Her Shivers Down Her Spine
Cuz Roses Are Red And Violets Are Blue
And When All Else Fails Do Something New
It's How You Talk To Women
That Keeps Me Grinning
There Is No Such Thing
As Losing When You're Always Winning
You Can't Be Shallow
They Don't Like It When I Bleep
{Chorus: Leah Dazzio}
I Don't Know You
I Don't Know You
I Don't Know You
I Just Don't Know You
I Don't Know You
I Don't Know You
I Don't Know You
