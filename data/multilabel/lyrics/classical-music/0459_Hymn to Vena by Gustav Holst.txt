Vena comes, born of light
He drives the many-colour’d clouds onward
Here, where the sunlight and the waters mingle
Our songs float up and caress the new-born infant

[Verse 2]
The child of cloud and mist appeareth on the ridge of the sky
He shines on the summit of creation
The hosts proclaim the glory of our common Father

[Verse 3]
He hath come to the bosom of his beloved
Smiling on him
She beareth him to highest heav’n
With yearning heart
On thee we gaze, O gold-wing’d messenger of mighty gods

[Verse 4]
Wise men see him in their libations
As the sacrifice mounts to the eternal heights, mingling with our solemn chant

[Verse 5]
He stands erect in highest heav’n
Clad in noble raiment, arm’d with shining weapons
Hurling light to the farthest region
Rejoicing in his radiant splendourYou might also like
