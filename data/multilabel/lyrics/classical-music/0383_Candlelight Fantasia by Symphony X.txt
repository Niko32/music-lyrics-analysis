[Verse 1]
Just one more night
One more score
Another question in my mind
Can't take no more
Kissing the tears from my face
As they fall to the ground in silence

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
In twilight
And faded times
Spirits cold, with no love
Bells ring the lonely chime
Candle fire
These lit dreams can't burn alone

[Verse 3]
Winds of change
Bring songs upon my memory
An empty heart and soul intoxicates me
This darkened page
Orchestrates my final destiny
Not knowing what
What tomorrow may bring
You might also like[Chorus]
From within the mirror's eyes
I'm forced to run away and hide
I feel those mystic eyes subside
And leave me blind
Through passages in time
A prisoner locked behind the door
Lonely roses slowly wither and die

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 4]
I can't escape, this captive misery
Heart stone cold, under supremacy
Thrown into a raging sea of tyranny
Life's vile walls, have tangled me in webs
Eternally, within my future's threads
Play the violent strings of my symphony

[Instrumental Break/Solos]

[Verse 5]
Transcend, the absence of this fantasy
Just another vision, washed away with the tide
No place for forgotten ones, I cannot deny
(No place for forgotten ones)
What lies beyond, beyond this fantasy
[Chorus]
From within the mirror's eyes
I'm forced to run away and hide
I feel those mystic eyes subside
And leave me blind
Through passages in time
A prisoner locked behind the door
Lonely roses slowly wither and die

[Outro]
From within the mirror's eyes
I'm forced to run away and hide
I feel those mystic eyes subside
And leave me blind
Through passages in time
A prisoner locked behind the door
Lonely roses slowly wither and die
