I trust that everyone is enjoying the music
As the title of the album suggests
This was meant for your listening pleasure
While you are being "done in"
However, anyone may listen
We have no intention to discriminate
After all, the murderer has as much right to enjoy himself as his victim
Which brings me to this very practical aspect of our album
If you turn the volume up very loud it will drown out screams
