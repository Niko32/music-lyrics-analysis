I'm starting to think
When I tell everyone
'Bout leaving and getting away
That what I'm really saying
To them and through them
Is that I just want them to stay
I'm starting to think
When I tell everyone
'Bout leaving and getting away
That what I'm really saying
To them and through them
Is that I just want them to stay
