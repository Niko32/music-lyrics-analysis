Thanks Ugly God, thanks Ugly God
Stars shining right above you
Night breezes seem to whisper, "I love you"
Birds sing in the sycamore trees
Dream a little dream of me
Thanks Ugly God, thanks Ugly God

[Verse 1]
I used to go to school, but, bitch, I'm better off at rappin'
Yeah, I'm fresh to death, wipe me down just like a napkin
When I fuck yo' bitch, I moonwalk like Michael Jackson
I used to beg for hoes, now I'm the Booty Gang Captain
Freaky, yeah, I got your bitch, she tryna freak me
Easy, I'm posted on your wall just like graffiti
You talk shit on Instagram, but starstruck when you see me
Believe me, I'm still that same nigga steal your TV
Move, bitch! When I'm done, put on your shoes, bitch
You see me on this Call of Duty, please get out my room, bitch
I'm in my coupe, two-door, sorry, ain't no room
Call the Uber, I'ma tip your driver just to zoom
Your bitch fucking with me, yeah, she stuck on me, no glue stick
Hatin' niggas on my dick, I brush it off, no broomstick
Niggas switch, I don't fuck with niggas I was cool with
But I'm tryna fuck on every bitch I went to school with

Say, "Nighty night," and kiss me
Just hold me tight, and tell me you miss me
While I'm alone and blue as can be
Dream a little dream of me

[Verse 2]
Thanks Ugly God (Thanks Ugly God)
Tryna tell you, these niggas be fake, Ugly God
You gotta watch out just to be safe, Ugly God
They talk behind your back
But then they smile up in your face, Ugly
God
Thanks, Ugly God!
Damn, when you gon' pull out that Wraith, Ugly God?
Damn, I remember they used to hate, Ugly God
Damn, I remember they used to snake, Ugly God

[Outro: Doris Day]
Thanks Ugly God, thanks Ugly God
Sweet dreams 'til sunbeams find you
Sweet dreams that leave our worries behind you
But in your dreams, whatever they be
Dream a little dream of me
