Oh yeah... Alright...

[Verse 1: Rivers Cuomo and Matt Sharp]
Somebody's Heine is crowding my icebox
Somebody's cold one is giving me chills
Guess I'll just close my eyes

Oh yeah, alright...
Feels good inside...

[Verse 2: Rivers Cuomo and Matt Sharp]
Flip on the telly, wrestle with Jimmy
Something is bubbling behind my back
The bottle is ready to blow

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so, your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so, my love is a life taker

[Verse 3: Rivers Cuomo]
I can't confront you, I never could do
That which might hurt you, so try and be cool
When I say, "this way is a water slide away from me
That takes you further every day," so be cool
You might also like[Chorus]
Say it ain't so, your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so, my love is a life taker

[Bridge: Rivers Cuomo]
Dear daddy, I write you, in spite of years of silence
You've cleaned up, found Jesus, things are good, or so I hear
This bottle of Stephen's awakens ancient feelings
Like father, stepfather, the son is drowning in the floooooooood
Yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Say it ain't so, your drug is a heartbreaker
Say it ain't so
