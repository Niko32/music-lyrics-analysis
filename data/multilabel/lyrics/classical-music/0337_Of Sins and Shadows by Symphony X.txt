Ahh, ah ah

[Verse 1]
Passing through the void
The darkest grand illusion
Chaos riding on the wind
Destroyed in agony
They create a maddened lair
Summon all to heed their cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Innocence fading away
The dying eyes of the prey

[Chorus]
Desperate cries
Hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin
Shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Victims of desire
Pestilence of their invasion
Forms then take on evil waves
Paralyze, victimize
The shadows fall and enter fast from the sky
(From the sky, from the sky)
Summon all who hear their cry
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Innocence fading away
The dying eyes of the prey

[Chorus]
Desperate cries
Hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin
Shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within
Within

[Bridge]
I've betrayed, slowly fade
I repent my inner plea
I've denied, sanctified
Cannot hide from this monstrosity
I'm immersed in a curse of this jaded imagery
Realize that your cries only jeopardize this legacy

[Guitar/Keyboard Solos]

[Chorus]
Desperate cries
Hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin
Shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within
[Outro]
Desperate cries
Hail of fire deciding
All our fate in the night
Tempt in sin
Shadows then begin to
Gather the souls they hold within
Within
