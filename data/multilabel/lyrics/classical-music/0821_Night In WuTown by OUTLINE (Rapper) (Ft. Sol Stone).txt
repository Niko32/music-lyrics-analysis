Yeah Yeah

OUTLINE
Let's go!
Late night cruisin' on a bike ting
Watchin' Wu-town night kick in
You don't know if there be fightin' or bitin'
But I'll be here thinkin' of the next lines I'm writin'
Bullies get pissed and cause a big scene
I don't wanna be seen in that scene!
Some man blaze up what they see is green
They don't care man, they not SUPREME
Headlight dazzle every man that walk by
Tramps everywhere just surviving the night
Dark hoods are lit by dim street light
Dark alleys are the places that come alive
Oh My God they thrive
You might also likeDrug deals happen at night

See man do his ting out in the night
Club man down cos they can not fight

The night bitches aren't gonna be nice to you
They aren't nice to me so where's the hope for you?

Bitches wanna take control of you
They say they never gave consent
Man, these bitches just played you
Man, you need to watch out for dem
Or they may trap you in their lickle den
They're not your friend, they're just *unintelligible*
Man these fuckin' skets
Me and the Devil are besties
That means you can't come against me
Brudders wanna test me
But lickle do they know

The Devil gave me the fightin' spirit of a Don Bruce Lee
Family gives a whole new meaning
Theres more to a person than meets the eye
You get me?
Brudders don't get me and they need to
I'm not goin' bro and you need to
Im rapping 'bout Wu-town like it's illegal
I'm too sick to fly
Man, call me Lil Eagle
You're asking who eats man alive
Yeah, we do

So fuck off man, we don't need you
I don't care who you goons are fam
They're just people

Man be dissin' and hide their face like a meagle
Chat shit and ill kill you with a Deagle
My music is around just like a seagull

"Who keeps grime alive?"
I said, "We do"

Dark nights are gruesome to watch
Man really wanna come here and try and take my watch
But little does he know all my g's are right there
Fam he didn't clock
Now he's gonna get boxed
Been on the Earth a small amount of time
I've seen a lot
It doesn't affect me i'm not gonna rot
Like the rest of these yutes
Don't hate me cos I tell truth
