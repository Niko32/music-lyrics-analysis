You might think you're hurt
But I haven't found my way to make you feel
You might feel fine
But you haven't found your way to go back home
Wild, misunderstood
Times are hard, but I'm harder
Rusted to the roots
You should know that I fought

[Chorus: Cherry Lena]
I can't keep trust
I keep fading off the route
It's not what I came for
I can't keep up
It keeps you out of the room
That's not what I came for

[Bridge: Cherry Lena]
Cause were not what we're supposed to feel
Giving you everything
You ain't giving anything

[Chorus: Cherry Lena]
I can't keep trust
I keep fading off the route
It's not what I came for
Can't keep trust
Keep fading off the route
It's not what I came for
You might also like[Build: Cherry Lena]
I can't keep trust
Keep fading off the route
It's not what I came for
I can't keep trust
Keep fading off the route
It's not what I came for

[Drop]

[Bridge: Cherry Lena]
It's all that I want

[Build: Cherry Lena]
I can't keep trust
Keep fading off the route
It's not what I came for
I can't keep trust
Keep fading off the route
It's not what I came for

[Drop]

[Bridge: Cherry Lena]
It's all that I want
[Outro: Cherry Lena]
Bury it
To the ground
Start to count
You know
Where to go
But not when to be gone
Dig it up
To the ground
Start to count
You know
Where to go
But not when to be found
