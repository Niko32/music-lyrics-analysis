When the time comes leaves will fly with the wind
With it also take my memories for me?
There it's so deep it's never touched any light
The light that was high in the sky

[Verse 2]
When it's cold all flowers turn to earth
Even the one that was cherished by all
Learning to let go of what you once loved
And that's when you're ready to move on

[Pre-Chorus]
Even a dark cloud has its own silver lines
After the storm is when the forest bears life
When the wind blows red petals fly in the air and that's when
Flowers bloom

[Chorus]
The petals fade and then move on
Is it me or my past that will not let me go?
My scarlet stains within me
When the next chapter starts It will shine white

[Instrumental Break]

Petals dance along to the touch of the breeze
Waltzing together down a lane from memory
Seasons have changed and now a new melody plays so now
Flowers bloom

[Chorus]
The petals fade and then move on
Is it me or my past that will not let me go?
My scarlet stains within me
When the next chapter starts It will shine white

[Outro]
Memories that I hold on
Let them fly in the air
Sail with a farewell, my scarlet stains within me
When the next chapter starts, it will shine white
