Cheerio, here I go on my way

Wish me luck as you wave me goodbye
With a cheer, not a tear, make it gay

Give me a smile, I can keep for a while
In my heart while I'm away

Till we meet once again you and I
Wish me luck as you wave me goodbye

Wish me luck as you wave me goodbye
Cheerio, here I go, on my way

Wish me luck as you wave me goodbye
With a cheer, not a tear, make it gay

Give me a smile, I can keep for a while
In my heart while I'm away

Till we meet once again you and I
Wish me luck as you wave me goodbyeYou might also like
