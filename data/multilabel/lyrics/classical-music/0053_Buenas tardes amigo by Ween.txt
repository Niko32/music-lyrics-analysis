Buenas tardes amigo
Hola, my good friend
Cinco de Mayo's on Tuesday
And I hoped we'd see each other again

[Verse 2]
You killed my brother last winter
You shot him three times in the back
In the night I still hear mama weeping
Oh mama, still dresses in black

[Verse 3]
I looked at every fiesta
For you I wanted to greet
Maybe I'd sell you a chicken
With poison interlaced with the meat

[Verse 4]
You... you look like my brother
Mama loved him the best
He was head honcho with the ladies
Mama always said he was blessed

[Verse 5]
The village all gathered around him
They couldn't believe what they saw
I said it was you that had killed him
And that I'd find you and upstand the law
You might also like[Verse 6]
The people of the village believed me
Mama... she wanted revenge
I told her I'd see that she was honored
I'd find you and put you to death

[Dramatic Instrumentation]

[Verse 7]
So now... now that I've found you
On this such a joyous day
I tell you it was me who killed him
But the truth I'll never have to say

[Verse 1 reprise]

I hoped we'd see each other... again
