[Part II - Journey to Ithaca]

To the one that I love, my journey has begun
When our eyes meet once more there will be peace
The taste of your lips the warmth of your touch
Again, forever, two souls as one

Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home - I'm dreaming of the home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
To return would make my dream come true

Seasons of sorrow have stolen all my years
I miss the rolling hills of Ithaca
I've been through battles and cried a sea of tears
But the tide is changing, and with it all my fears

Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home - I'm dreaming of the home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
To return would make my dream come true
You might also likeBehold the sea and winds of Jove
We set sail guided by the stars above
The ports of Troy escape our view
A cold and stormy fate awaits our rendezvous

Onward we ride, into the raging fury
Setting our course by the moon and sun
We forge ahead seeking glory
Yet the journey has just begun

Onward we ride - nine days we brave her might
We are coming home...

[Part III - The Eye]

Awakened at dawn - Land dead ahead
With the winds of the morning we change course
No remorse, a place forbidden to all

Search all the grounds - find food and water
Yet journey not into the Cave of Woe
Long ago, a legend spoke of a beast

A thousand riches hidden deep within the stone
A thousand nightmares mortal blood forever flows
A mountainous black - engulfed in a shadow
A bone-chilling growl and an Eye of Hate
A ghastly fate - held prisoner by the Eye

Yet he must sleep - as the daylight fades
We focus our senses and sharpen our blade
We take aim - In silence we strike

A thousand riches hidden deep within the stone
A thousand nightmares - blood runs forever - from the Eye...

[Part IV - Circe (Daughter of the Sun)]

We sit adrift on the open sea
The gift of wind, by Zeus, concealed - so carelessly
We break the waves on a course untrue
Across the endless plain of blue - a new coast in view

Yeah...

We carouse with the maiden
Beneath her eyes the madness lies
...in mystery

I drink deep from the chalice
Of gold and jade - my senses fade
...I'm mesmerized
Stay - like those before
I condemn you all - from walk to crawl
...metamorphasized
No - my will it defies her
Speak the verse - lift the curse
...she's mesmerized

Am I asleep?
Tell me Daughter of the Sun
There's vengeance in the air and all things must be undone

[Part V - Sirens]

Dire warnings -
Told by the sorceress in white
'false bringers of love' - Sirens
Echoing songs from above

Wings flowing -
Floating on Sea of Lies
I defy their vision
Elysium swallows my cries

Embracing -
Maidens of lust stimulate
And manipulate my senses
I welcome a watery grave
Tied steadfast to the mast
Tragedy awaits me
I'm falling victim
Betrayed by the sea

[Part VI - Scylla and Charybdis]

[a) Gulf of Doom]
[b) Drifting Home]

[Part VII - The Fate of the Suitors / Champion of Ithaca]

So this is home...
In the guise of a beggar - Minerva guides my way
I find my kingdom in jeopardy

Vengeance - it swells within me
As I spy so many who eye my Queen
I'll make them pay for this blasphemy... All will see

Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
I will right all the wrongs
Let the Gods sing my song
Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
Let a new life begin
My journey has come to and end

A contest of valor
'to pierce the twelve rings
In a single arrow's flight'
Yet, not a one can string the bow
My veil of silence lifted
All is revealed
Revenge burns in my heart
Thrashing and slashing down all my foes...to claim the throne

Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
I will right all the wrongs
Let the Gods sing my song
Triumphant - Champion of Ithaca
Let a new life begin
This is the end of my Odyssey
Seems like forever that my eyes have been denied
Home - I'm finally home
I've been twenty years away from all I ever knew
I have returned to make my dream come true
