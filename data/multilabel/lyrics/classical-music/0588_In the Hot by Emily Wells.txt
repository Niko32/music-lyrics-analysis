It's only me
I'm just, one ride way
One ride away from it
One ride away
One ride away from it
Some call it agony
Some call it madness
Some call it empathy
Some say clairvoyance
I'm just one ride away
One ride away from it
One ride away
One ride away from it

In the hot, in the hot
In the hot
In the hot, in the hot
In the hot I got close to God
Got close to God, I got close to God
In the hot, in the hot
In the hot I got close to God, I got close to God
I got close to God, I got close to

I got close to God, I got close to
I got close to God, I got
I got close to God, I got close to
I got close to God, I got close to
I got close to God, I got
I got close to God, I got close to
I got close to God, I got close to
I got close to God, I got
I got close to God, I got close to
