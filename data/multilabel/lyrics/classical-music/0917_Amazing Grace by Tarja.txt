That sav’d a wretch like me!

I once was lost, but now I'm found;
Was blind, but now I see

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear
And grace my fears reliev’d;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believ’d!

Thro’ many dangers, toils and snares
I have already come;
’Tis grace has brought me safe thus far
And grace will lead me home

I once was lost, but now I'm found;
Was blind, but now I seeYou might also like
