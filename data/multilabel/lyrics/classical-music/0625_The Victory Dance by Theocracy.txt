She stares ahead in silence again
Her eyes tell me of struggles, loss and pain
A mask to hide a world of sorrow
Where hollow, painted smiles remain
The flesh whispers its lies to me
And walks me to the edge, so far to fall
I'll never have another chance if there's a chance at all
If I fail this time...

[Chorus]
Seven scars turn to ashes
Faces of madness melt into victory
Trial by fire, my burden
Burned in refining flames of purity
Seven steps into darkness
Mortal and crownless
Eternal victory
Altar flames rising, burning higher
And straight through the fire
I'm dancing the victory dance

[Verse 2]
She takes the communion cup unholy
Born and raised a slave to rules of man
Will my eyes reflect You
When she searches them again?
I am not a god
I release this burden unto You
You might also like[Chorus]
Seven scars turn to ashes
Faces of madness melt into victory
Trial by fire, my burden
Burned in refining flames of purity
Seven steps into darkness
Mortal and crownless
Eternal victory
Altar flames rising, burning higher
And straight through the fire
I'm dancing the victory dance

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Seven scars turn to ashes
Faces of madness melt into victory
Trial by fire, my burden
Burned in refining flames of purity
Seven steps into darkness
Mortal and crownless
Eternal victory
Altar flames rising, burning higher
And straight through the fire
I'm dancing the victory dance
