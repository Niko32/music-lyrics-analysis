To lie with you
To die with you
I’m alive by you

Your kiss, your fist, I’m alive by you
Your kiss, your fist, I’m alive by you

You and me, the power of you and me
You and me, our dreams
You and me, the power of you and me, joy now!

You are under (are under)
My muscle (my muscle)
Inside (inside)
The heart of me (the heart of me)
There is no (is no) escape (escape) from you (from you)
There is no (there is no) escape (escape)

Your kiss, your fist, I’m alive by you (by you)
Your kiss, your fist (your fist), I’m alive by you (by you)

You and me, the power of you and me, you and me
The power of you and me
You and me, the power of you and me, you and me
The power of you and me
Insecurity, tearing down our dreams
