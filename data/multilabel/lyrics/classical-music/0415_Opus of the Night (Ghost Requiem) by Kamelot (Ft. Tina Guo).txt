It was cold the day they found you by the river
Broken dreams had turned to ice upon your cheek
It was cold the day I swore
Until my dying breath
I'd give my life to heal those broken dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
I've waited
Longed for the day
To show you
To take you away

[Chorus]
Rise to the queen of the symphony
Watch her step into the light
Surrender your heart to the melody
Let it take flight
She'll sing to you
The opus of the night

[Verse 2]
Trembling steps into a world she had forgotten
Dusty roses on a royal velvet seat
And the letter in her name
Brings her back again
Familiar the notes upon the sheet
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I've waited
Longed for the day
Seduce me
Take me away

[Chorus]
Rise to the queen of the symphony
Watch her step into the light
Surrender your heart to the melody
Let it take flight
She'll sing to you
The opus of the night

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
A dark silhouette
Lingering age old desperation
Reviving grand nostalgia
Come shivers of pure admiration

[Pre-Chorus]
Close your eyes
Now let your emotions take flight
Goddess in white
[Chorus]
Rise to the queen of the symphony
Watch her step into the light
Surrender your heart to the melody
Let it take flight
She'll sing to you
The opus of the night

[Post-Chorus]
One last encore for the queen of the stage
One final bow for the old prima donna

[Outro]
I sing to you
The opus of the night
