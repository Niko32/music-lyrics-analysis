Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have foreseen

[Verse 1]
Miles away
You're heading for the unknown
And there's no way to get back
Time to complain
Nobody is telling the truth
To live in the crowd
Sick of your own vanity
Dead scattered petals around
Hymns of betrayal
Calling you for the attack

[Chorus]
Evil warning
You're much too fast and much too high
No time to worry!
It's over, no more remaining time
To cry and feel the pain
In the morning
You stagger up
To start the fight
You get so lonely
With no fore-sight
Until another day!
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Run, don't wait for the sun
Cause it's setting on your hopes
Don't look far behind
For the shadows, they still stand
Until the end!

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have foreseen
Time to believe in the dream that you've seen
In a world that is broken and mean
One day the sun it will shine for us all
Take the freedom that you have foreseen

[Chorus]
Evil warning
You're much too fast and much too high
No time to worry!
It's over, no more remaining time
To cry and feel the pain
Run, don't wait for the sun
Cause it's setting on your hopes
Don't look far behind
For the shadows, they still stand
Until the end!
[Post-Chorus]
Don't let your pride
Make your blood flow in vain
Until the end!
