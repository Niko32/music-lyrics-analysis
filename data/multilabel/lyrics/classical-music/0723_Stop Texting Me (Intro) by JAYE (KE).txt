I'm done pleasing everybody else I see
Nothing else but the utmost best of me
I’m like a drug everybody keeps testing me
You wanna talk? I'm on the line
But stop texting me

I'm done pleasing everybody else I see
Nothing else but the utmost best of me
I’m like a drug everybody keeps testing me
You wanna talk? I'm on the line
But stop texting me

VERSE:
You rather talk me out than get me out of it
I know that you lying when you say you handled it
“It's the reefer, it's the weed”  What?
Pardon me but you need to ease up
We're losing control
Capsizing the boat
Niggas do it one time but I succeed in a row
Niggas shouting they hard, I'm like a fluid I flow
At the same time I ain't got shit but soon we will know
We done lost ourselves
Looking at the people like “How can I Help?”
I can relate to the pain that you felt
I can relate to the pain that you felt
You changed too much I don't know you
You’re way too broke I can bore you
Your chain is too long you could fall through
I come number one , you come number two
