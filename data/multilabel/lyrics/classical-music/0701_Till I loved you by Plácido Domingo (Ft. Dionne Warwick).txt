Nothing lived, nothing grew till I loved you
Every sky ever gray, never blue
You were my friend, good friend
And often, I would wonder
Could the one to save me possibly be you?

[Dionne Warwick]
I was lost, I was blind till I loved you
Wouldn't see, couldn't find someone new, someone new
You were my friend, my dear friend
I held you close to my heart
But I never knew my soul could break in two

[Domingo and Warwick]
Until that certain moment when I loved you

[Pl치cido Domingo]
Not I ever entered my room
When my room was without you

[Dionne Warwick]
My love never came into bloom
'til each thought was about you

[Pl치cido Domingo] (Dionne Warwick is Adlibbing here)
Not a bird in the spring, 'til I loved you
Not a dream or a prayer could come true
Until that curtain lifted, parted, drifted from you
Until that certain moment when I loved you
You might also like[Pl치cido Domingo] (Warwick is, again, adlibbing)
Until that certain moment
Certain moment

[Domingo and Warwick]
When I loved you
When I loved you

[Pl치cido Domingo]
Nothing lived, nothing grew till I loved you

[Dionne Warwick]
Every sky ever gray, never blue
