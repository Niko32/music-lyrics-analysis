Your winding winds did sow
All that is my own
Where land and water meet
Where on my soul I sit upon my bed
Your ways have led me to bleed

[Verse 1]
Every child will be a leader
Every wise man's word a rule
Every keeper will be a sleeper
And a guide to ways unshown

[Chorus]
Your winding winds did sow
All that is my own
Where land and water meet
Where on my soul I sit upon my bed
Your ways have led me to bleed

[Verse 2]
He who knows may pass on
The word unknown
And meet me on the desert shore
Meet me on the desert shore
You might also like[Chorus]
Your winding winds did sow
All that is my own
Where land and water meet
Where on my soul I sit upon my bed
Your ways have led me to bleed

[Verse 3]
He who knows may pass on
The word unknown
And meet me on the desert shore
Meet me on the desert shore
Meet me on the desert shore

[Chorus]
Your winding winds stood so
All that is my own
Where land and water meet
Where on my soul I sit upon my bed
Your ways have led me to bleed
