[Verse]
Years gone by (Awake again)
In a glowing star (That shines so far)
Lasting child (Remains inside)
Playing around (A future denied)
High overhead, dusk is in sight!

[Pre-Chorus]
Fumbling the mist
Lingering around!

[Chorus]
Blow
Carrying winds
Take me high
Where I can see
The hidden lights
That blink far beyond

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Blow
Carrying winds
Take me high
Where I can see
The hidden lights
That blink far beyond
And then
A painted dream
Colours that melt
Inside slender frames
There I'll stand
There I belong...
