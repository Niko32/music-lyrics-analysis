I'm in a rainbow
And I'm feelin' mighty good
Color vibrations passin' me by
Some goin' through me not tellin' me why
Some slow and some fast and some teaching me how to fly

[Verse 2]
I'm (Not too sure now but I think that I'm) in a rainbow
And (After thinking of joy that) I'm feeling mighty good
Noises to see and colors that sound
Voices from nowhere and yet so profound
Naming off colors and places that just can't be found

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 3]
I'm (Not too sure now but I think that I'm) in a rainbow
And (After thinking of joy that) I'm feeling mighty good
Constantly moving but not knowing where
Gazing at hypnotic things here and there
And always thinking ahead 'cause the past couldn't careYou might also like
