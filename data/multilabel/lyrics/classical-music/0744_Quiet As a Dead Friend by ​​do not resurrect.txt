Open season on you peons
Load in three you know the reason
Known to leave 'em leakin' bleeding
You might think he lost a liter
I'm a genius with the speech
I make her leak like Aquafina
I might be in Italy the way I make 'em lean like Pisa
She a diva

[Verse]
Rich dicktip kid
Ladies love it when I hip fire
Spit sick shit
She gon' buss it 'til that bitch tired
Run around the block
I bring it back just like an oldie
Got my gun I tote them Glocks
I brought that MAC, ain’t no "aroni"
Hoe you phony with the love so bitch quit liking my pictures
Boy, you forty with no job
You can’t even talk without snitching
I'm a god amongst you men so when you beg for forgiveness
Just know these hollows heaven-sent
Thy will be done with no witness
I’ll give 'em stitches
