It's alright no need to question
Taste the night
Just close your eyes
It just takes one bite

All you need's in my possession
Just believe
Come take my hand tonight
And trust your dream

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm falling all to pieces
Slowly losing control

[Chorus]
Can it be true?
Why can't you see I'm burning for you?
There's no disguise in my desires
What can I do?

All you will know
Give me your heart
Give me your soul
I'll tear it apart
So long as you never
Let me go

On your ear, a whisper fallen
Show no fear
Just spread your wings and fly
Shed no tears

Pleasure's pain, I hear it calling
Feed the flame
Within becoming kin with the sons of Cain

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm falling all to pieces
Slowly losing control

[Chorus]
Can it be true?
Why can't you see I'm burning for you?
There's no disguise in my desires
What can I do?

All you will know
Give me your heart
Give me your soul
I'll tear it apart
So long as you never
Let me go
[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
All you will know
Give me your heart
Give me your soul
I'll tear it apart
So long as you never
Let me go
