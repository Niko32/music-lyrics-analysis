Baby, you're a liar
Well, maybe I'm a liar too
L.A.'s filled with liars
Top grade bullshit providers
Baby, you're a liar
Well, maybe I'm a liar too
L.A.'s filled with liars
Top grade bullshit providers

[Verse 1]
Life is like black magic
But if one last spell gets casted
Make those L.A. barbies plastic
Make the press overdramatic
Fake people tend to turn to other cheek
Face puffed up with the botox fleek
Like the face of my city got trapped in the belly of the beast
At least that happens now
You'll get chewed up and spit out
If the devil holds you down, don't mess it up
Get in line with the rest of us
We got hell to pay, welcome to L.A

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a liar
Well, maybe I'm a liar too
L.A.'s filled with liars
Top grade bullshit providers
Baby, you're a liar
Well, maybe I'm a liar too
L.A.'s filled with liars
Top grade bullshit providers

Mr. Hollywood with the pockets fat
Drug addicts in a sleeping bag
Traffic jam got the street impact
It's all bad, it's all bad

[Chorus]
Baby, you're a liar
Well, maybe I'm a liar too
L.A.'s filled with liars
Top grade bullshit providers
Baby, you're a liar
Well, maybe I'm a liar too
L.A.'s filled with liars
