Maybe he and I
Are like a pair of suns that are captured
Maybe he and I are like a pair of Suns
That are captured
Eternally linked into chasing each other's spin
Eternally linked into chasing each other's spin

[Pre-Chorus 1: Tori Amos & Natashya Hawley]
Bound by beliefs
That have become steel cords
Why the disharmony?
Let's re-sing my world
With a harmonic defiance I'll face this

[Chorus 1: Tori Amos & Natashya Hawley]
I'd like to induct you into
The drink of the cactus practice
Cactus
Cactus?
Practice
Will you induct me into
The drink of the cactus practice?
Cactus
Cactus
Practice

Are you saying I'm
Reactive but I can work with it, doll-face
Every couple has their version of what they call the truth?
Every couple has their version of what they call the truth

[Pre-Chorus 2: Tori Amos, Natashya Hawley and Tori Amos & Natashya Hawley]
Call all that lies
Beneath both stories
Back to my fire
Embrace what you find
With a harmonic defiance I'll face this

[Chorus 2: Tori Amos & Natashya Hawley]
It's time to induct you into
The drink of the cactus practice
Cactus?
Cactus
Practice
I'd like to induct you into
The drink of the cactus practice
Cactus?
Cactus
Practice
Will you induct me into
The drink of the cactus practice?
Cactus? Cactus
