Do you live in New York City?
Or a couple towns away
Wherever you are
I'd jump in my car just to see you today

[Pre-Chorus]
Will I meet you at a party?
Sit next to you on a plane
Maybe I already know you and loathe you
But we'll fall in love some day

[Chorus]
Dear soulmate
Do you think of me
Like I do
Do you have green eyes
Or are they brown like mine?
Do you have a sister too?
Dear soulmate
One day I'll give this song to you

[Verse 2]
Will we drive up to the mountains?
Camp in a little tent
When the bears come at night
Will you put up a fight?
Or will you hide with mе and my flashlight
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Do you sleep on the right side?
'Cause I prеfer the left
Will you make me buttered toast?
Perhaps a morning roast
When I wake up and I'm sad

[Chorus]
Dear soulmate
Do you think of me
Like I do
Do you have green eyes?
Are they brown like mine?
Do you have a sister too?
Dear soulmate
One day I'll give this song to you

[Outro]
Dear soulmate
I can't wait to fall in love with you
