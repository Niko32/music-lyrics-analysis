Is being any other place than this
'Cause she remembers having wings
But she's forgotten what it's like to feel
A paradise of bliss

And all I want to do is fly
Just fly
And all I want to do is fly
Just fly

I wanna fly
Into the sky
I wanna fly to paradise
All through the night
Into the light
I wanna fly to paradise

And all she ever thinks about
Is memories of swinging through the sky
'Cause she remembers having wings
But she's forgotten what it feels like to fly

And all I want to do is fly
Just fly
And all I want to do is fly
Just fly
You might also likeI wanna fly
Into the sky
I wanna fly to paradise
All through the night
Into the light
I wanna fly to paradise

When you look into the sky
You might catch her flying by
Flying by
All she wants to do is fly
On her way to paradise
Paradise
