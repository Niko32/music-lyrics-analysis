He makes me down to lie
In pastures green; He leadeth me
The quiet waters by

My soul He doth restore again
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness
E’en for His own name’s sake

Yea, though I walk in death’s dark vale
Yet will I fear no ill;
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still

My table Thou hast furnished
In presence of my foesYou might also like
