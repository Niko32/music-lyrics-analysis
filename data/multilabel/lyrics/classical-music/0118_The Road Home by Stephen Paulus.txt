Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo

[Verse 1]
Tell me, where is the road
I can call my own
That I left, that I lost
So long ago
All these years I have wandered
Oh, when will I know
There's a way, there's a road
That will lead me home

[Bridge]
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo

[Verse 2]
After wind, after rain
When the dark is done
As I wake from a dream
In the gold of day
Through the air there's a calling
From far away
There's a voice I can hear
That will lead me home
You might also like[Bridge]
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo

[Verse 3]
Rise up, follow me
Come away, is the call
With the love in your heart
As the only song
There is no such beauty
As where you belong
Rise up, follow me
I will lead you home

[Outro]
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
Ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo-ooo
