Doubt is a broken record that plays inside my head
I try to turn it down, but I can't quite drown it out
I'm tortured every day, these never-ending worries, pulling on my sleeves

[Pre-Chrous]
So many times now I was supposed to tap out
All the walls would fall down around me
All anybody would tell me is all that bad news how it's gonna fall through
But no matter what they say or what they say

[Chorus]
It's gonna be, gonna be, okay (a, a, a, ay)
It's gonna be, gonna be, okay (a, a, a, ay)
No matter what you've been through here you are
No matter if you think you're falling apart
It's gonna be, okay

[Verse 2]
And there is a battle raging in your heart but you must win
It comes for all of us, saying we are not enough
So fight for your life the worlds gonna try
To sell you some lies

[Pre-Chorus]
So many times now I was supposed to tap out
All the walls would fall down around me
All anybody would tell me is all that bad news how it's gonna fall through
But no matter what they say or what they say

It's gonna be, gonna be, okay (a, a, a, ay)
It's gonna be, gonna be, okay (a, a, a, ay)
No matter what you've been through here you are
No matter if you think you're falling apart
It's gonna be, gonna be, okay (a, a, a, ay)
It's gonna be, okay
It's gonna be, gonna be, okay (a, a, a, ay)
It's gonna be, gonna be, okay (a, a, a, ay)
No matter what you've been through here you are
No matter if you think you're falling apart
It's gonna be, gonna be, okay (a, a, a, ay)
It's gonna be, okay

[Outro]
Woah, woah, woah (it's gonna be, gonna be)
Woah, woah, woah (it's gonna be, okay)
Woah, woah, woah (it's gonna be, gonna be)
Woah, woah, woah (it's gonna be, okay)
