Does time end here?
Is this what I fought for?
And what I've gained
What a fool I've been
To think life had more to offer
Instead I lie here
In remorse and suffer

And I hate you for doing this
And I hate you for saying that
I never did enough to ever please you
Never did enough for it to cease to
Affect me the way it does
Provoke me the way it must
And I'm still thinking
I'm not enough

My war on time
Got worse and faster
The sands fought hard
And every day I lost a battle
And even thought I know I lied
And even though I saw the signs
The same three words each time
I am fine
You might also likeAnd I hate you for doing this
And I hate you for saying that
I never did enough to ever please you
Never did enough for it to cease to
Affect me the way it does
Provoke me the way it must
And I'm still thinking
I'm not enough
I'm ashamed of the life I've lived
I'm afraid of what I have been
And it just became
Just became enough...
