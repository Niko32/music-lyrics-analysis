Our Father, who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy Name
Thy kingdom come
Thy will be done, On earth as it is in heaven
Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our trespasses
As we forgive those who trespass against us
And lead us not into temptation, But deliver us from evil
For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever and everYou might also like
