Mirror of tragic reflections
I'll break your glass showing pain
Pain for the infernal vision
Pain for that red bloody rain
Trapped in this lonely oblivion
Dishonoured by acts not to name
I search for answers forgotten
Trying not to become insane

[Pre-Chorus]
Baptized in fire is the dark knight who rides in me
Against the raging wind

[Chorus]
Rise from the wide sea of flames
To the valleys of eternity
Rise from the wide sea of flames
To lead me against the enemy
For the ruin of the king

[Verse 2]
Halls of dark stone are now falling
Under attack of the ghouls
Crashing the high dragons' tower
Witness of legend untold
My brothers run through the grey streets
Not spared by the queen's deadly call
Some throw themselves from the high walls
Denying the torture of soul
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Baptized in fire is the dark knight who rides in me
Against the raging wind

[Chorus]
Rise from the wide sea of flames
To the valleys of eternity
Rise from the wide sea of flames
To lead me against the enemy
For the ruin of the king

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Rise from the wide sea of flames
To the valleys of eternity
Rise from the wide sea of flames
To lead me against the enemy
For the ruin of the king
For the ruin of the king!
