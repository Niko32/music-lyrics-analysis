[Build up]
Laughing at my fate
They underestimate
Think they can break me
But they'll never catch me

[Bridge]
Catch me

I can hear them talk
Watching me like a hawk
I hear their whispers
Counting my failures

Laughing at my fate
They underestimate
Think they can break me
But they'll never catch me
