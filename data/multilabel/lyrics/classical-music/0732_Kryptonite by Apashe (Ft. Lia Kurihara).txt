And my head's breaking me down
God is in my sight, I'm losing my fates
You will never be out
Said I'm not away in a Kryptonite
And my head's breaking me down
God is in my sight, I'm losing my fates
You will never be out
Said I'm not away in a Kryptonite
And my head's breaking me down
God is in my sight, I'm losing my fates
You will never be out

Said I'm not away in a Kryptonite
And my head's breaking me down
God is in my sight, I'm losing my fates
You will never be out
Said I'm not away in a Kryptonite
And my head's breaking me down
God is in my sight, I'm losing my fates
You will never be out

It's dark inside the wind is gonе
And I've been dying just to catch your tears
