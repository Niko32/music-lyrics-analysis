I want to say hi to you
I have no reason to
But I thought of you while driving today
With Louis on the radio
I remembered how you loved him so
We'd play his records, dance real slow

[Verse 2]
I guess
That I'm missing you
I know it's out of the blue
I haven't thought of you for more than weeks
Now I'm dreaming of the moonlight glow
On your little studio
We both knew I had to go away

[Bridge]
Away to a place
Much bigger than this
Away from the land of fish and sea
To something new, a skyline view
Four thousand three hundred miles from you

[Verse 3]
It's complicated
You are my hometown love
Moved to the city of
Angels and I wish that you were hеre
You might also like[Chorus]
Now I'm in my empty studio
Don't dare to call, don't darе to know
If you want to say hello to me

[Outro]
Now I'm dreaming of your moonlight glow
From my empty studio
Hoping that you'll say hello to me
