[II. About to Crash]
[Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
She can't stop pacing, she never felt so alive
Her thoughts are racing, set on overdrive

It takes a village, this she knows is true
They're expecting her and she's got work to do

[Chorus 1]
He helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
As he rubs his red-rimmed eyes
He says "I've never seen her get this bad"

Even though she seems so high
He knows that she can't fly
And when she falls out of the sky
He'll be standing by

She was raised in a small midwestern town
By a charming and eccentric loving father
She was praised as the perfect teenage girl
And everyone thought highly of her

And she tried everyday
With endless drive to make the grade
Then one day, she woke up to find
The perfect girl had lost her mind

[Pre-Chorus]
Once barely taking a break
Now she sleeps the days away

[Chorus 2]
She helplessly stands by
It's meaningless to try
All she wants to do is cry
No one ever knew she was so sad

Cause even though she gets so high
And thinks that she can fly
She will fall out of the sky

[Post-Chorus]
But in the face of misery
She found hopefulness
Feeling better
She had weathered
This depression

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Much to her advantage
She resumed her frantic pace

Boundless power, midnight hour
She enjoyed the race

[Instrumental Outro]


[III. War Inside My Head]
[Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Napalm showers showed the cowards
We weren't there to mess around
Through heat exhaustion and mind distortion
A military victory mounted on innocent ground
[Chorus 1]
Hearing voices from miles away
Saying things never said
Seeing shadows in the light of the day
Waging a war inside my head

[Post-Chorus]
War inside my head!

[Verse 2]
Years and years of bloodshed and warfare
Our mission was only to get in and kill
A free vacation of palmtrees and shrapnel
Trading innocence for permanent psychotic hell

[Chorus 2]
Hearing voices from miles away
Saying things never said
Seeing shadows in the light of the day
Waging a war inside my head

[Outro]
Feeling strangers staring my way
Reading minds never read
Tasting danger with each word I say
Waging a war inside my--
[IV. The Test That Stumped Them All]
[Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Standing in the darkness, waiting for the light
The smell of pure adrenaline burning in the night
Random blinding flashes aiming at the stage
Intro tape begins to roll, igniting sonic rage

[Chorus 1]
Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me the answers to the test that stumped them all

[Bridge 1]
"The boy is simply crazy
Suffering from delusions
We honestly think that maybe
He might need an institution"

"He lives in a world of fiction
And really could use some help
We have just the place to fix him
To save him from himself!"

[Verse 2]
Curled up in the darkness, searching for the light
The smell of stale sweat and shit streaming through the night
Random urine testing; pills red, pink and blue
Counseling and therapy, providing not a clue

[Chorus 2]
Still they keep me between these hollow walls
Hoping to find in me
The answers to the test that stumped them all

[Bridge 2]
"We can't seem to find the answers
He seemed such a clear cut case
We cannot just let him leave here
And put all this work to waste
"Why don't we try shock treatment?
It really might do some help
We have just the tools to fix him
To save him from himself!"

[Instrumental Outro]


[V. Goodnight Kiss]
[Lyrics: Mike Portnoy]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
Goodnight kiss in your nightgown
Lavender in your bed
So innocent as you lie down
Sweet dreams that run through your head

[Chorus 1]
Are you lonely without mommy's love?
I want you to know I'd die for that moment
You're just a poor girl, afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all

[Verse 2]
It's been five years to the day and
My tainted blood's still the same
I can't help acting this way and
Those bastard doctors are gonna pay

[Chorus 2]
I'm so lonely without baby's love
I want you to know I'd die for one more moment
I'm just a poor girl, afraid of this cruel world
Taken away from it all

[Instrumental Outro]


[VI. Solitary Shell]
[Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
He seemed no different from the rest
Just a healthy normal boy
His mama always did her best
And he was daddy's pride and joy
He learned to walk and talk on time
But never cared much to be held
And steadily he would decline
Into his solitary shell

[Pre-Chorus]
As a boy he was considered somewhat odd
Kept to himself most of the time
He would daydream in and out of his own world
But in every other way he was fine

[Chorus 1]
He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell

A temporary catatonic
Madman on occasion
When will he break out
Of his solitary shell?

[Verse 2]
He struggled to get through his day
He was helplessly behind
He poured himself onto the page
Writing for hours at a time

[Pre-Chorus]
As a man he was a danger to himself
Fearful and sad most of the time
He was drifting in and out of sanity
But in every other way he was fine

[Chorus 2]
He's a Monday morning lunatic
Disturbed from time to time
Lost within himself
In his solitary shell

A momentary maniac
With casual delusions
When will he be let out
Of his solitary shell?

[Instrumental Outro]


[VII. About to Crash (Reprise)]
[Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
I'm alive again, the darkness far behind me
I'm invincible, despair will never find me
I feel strong, I've got a new sense of elation
Boundless energy, euphoria fixation

[Chorus 1]
Still it's hard to just get by
It seems so meaningless to try
When all I want to do is cry
Who would ever know I felt so sad?

Even though I get so high
I know that I will never fly
And when I fall out of the sky
Who'll be standing by?

[Post-Chorus]
Will you be standing by?

[Instrumental Outro]


[VIII. Losing Time/Grand Finale]
[Lyrics: John Petrucci]

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
She dresses in black everyday
She keeps her hair simple and plain
She never wears makeup
But no one would care if she did anyway

She doesn't recall yesterday
Faces seem twisted and strange
But she always wakes up
Only to find she'd been miles away

[Refrain]
Absence of awareness, losing time
A lapse of perception, losing time

[Verse 2]
Wanting to escape
She had created a way to survive
She learned to detach from herself
A behavior that kept her alive

[Bridge]
Hope in the face of our human distress
Helps us to understand
The turbulence deep inside
That takes hold of our lives

Shame and disgrace over mental unrest
Keeps us from saving those we love
The grace within our hearts
And the sorrow in our souls

[Outro]
Deception of fame
Vengeance of war
Lives torn apart!

Losing oneself
Spiraling down
Feeling the walls closing in

A journey to find
The answers inside
Our elusive mind
