Black realm's majesty!

[Verse 1 – Olaf Hayer]
Arkan's friends were now convinced
They knew the real truth
Just her sacrifice would have been real hope for the Zaephyr's salvation
The old Vaikaris so spoke these were his own words from her sad arrival
He was sure that she was hiding something

[Pre-Chorus 1 – Olaf Hayer & Choir]
She is the portal of cosmic evil
All demons live in her alien breath
She keeps the seed of the far oblivion
And for all this she's condemned to death

[Chorus – Olaf Hayer & Choir]
Black realms' majesty
Light my sad destiny
My death may free his world
Chaos will not use me
(Chaos will not use me
Chaos will not use me
Chaos will not use me)
Anymore!

[Verse 3 – Olaf Hayer]
Arkan stopped her bitter words (Her bitter words)
With a kiss so warm (With a kiss so warm)
When she asked him to let her die there in the embrace of that frost
She could not accept the truth (Accept the truth)
She was the cause of all (The cause of all)
And knew evil now was using her as passage for its coming

[Pre-Chorus 2 – Olaf Hayer & Choir]
The eclipse is the sun of its newborn kingdom
The demons, the soldiers of this dark war
It wants to conquer the holy planet
It wants to rape the spirit of love

[Chorus – Olaf Hayer & Choir]
Black realms' majesty
Light my sad destiny
My death may free his world
Chaos will not use me
(Chaos will not use me
Chaos will not use me
Chaos will not use me)
Anymore! (More!)
[Bridge – Rannveig Sif Sigurðardóttir]
I will die in his name
To close the portal
To free my pain

[Guitar Solo with Hidden Message]
(I'll close the portal to free my pain)
(I'll close the portal to free my pain)

[Chorus – Olaf Hayer & Choir]
Black realms' majesty
Light my sad destiny
My death may free his world
Chaos will not use me
(Chaos will not use me
Chaos will not use me
Chaos will not use me)
Anymore!
Anymore!
