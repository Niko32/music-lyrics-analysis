Vou-me embora
Ver a lua
Ver a noite a passar
Até o sol nascer
Diz-me que vens p'ra me ver
Diz-me que vens p'ra ficar
Já não sei se espere por ti
Se estou a sonhar
Vou-me embora
Ver se encontro
Uma parte de mim
Que perdi no teu céu
Diz-me que vens p'ra mostrar
O que deixei por aí
Diz-me que queres e que não
Que não é sonho meu

[Verse 2: Jacob Collier, Both]
Oh, if you only could see
What you mean to me
Tomorrow will come
You will wake and you will see
That some things cannot be
What we want them to be
See the light, see it all around my head, oh
See the light, see it all the way home
See the light, see it all around my head, oh
See the light, see it all the way home
See the light, see it all around my head, oh
See the light, see it all the way home
See the light, see it all around my head, oh
