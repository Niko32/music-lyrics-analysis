Tonight we love while the moon
Beams down in dream light tonight
We touch the stars, love is ours
Night winds that sigh embrace the sky

[Chorus]
Tonight we love in the glow
That gleams so softly I know
This wasn't meant to borrow but tomorrow
Will it be gone, or will it always live on?
Tonight we love

[Outro]
Tonight we love in the glow
That gleams so softly I know
This wasn't meant to borrow but tomorrow
Will it be gone, or will it always live on?
Tonight we loveYou might also like
