[Verse 1]
I still remember when I was a child
So curious, adventurous and wild
Looked at the world with open eyes
I couldn't tell the truth from all the lies

I was taught how to live, how to behave
I was told, how to walk, to talk, to know my place
All those years I was searching for my way
All the world was my stage

[Chorus 1]
So I will turn every dream
Into reality
And through the dark they will be
The light to guide me

[Post-Chorus]
I'm on my own, walking down this road alone
I'll go on, I'll be strong, all I need is my eternal dream

[Verse 2]
Now I can see it all so clear
There are no boundaries and no frontier
You might also likeI wouldn't change the road I'm on
My dream lives on long after I am gone

I have learned I must do whatever it takes
I make mistakes, I must fall to rise again
Break the rules, all the chains that hold me down
I may sink but I won't drown

[Chorus 2]
So I will turn every dream
Into reality
And through the dark they will be
The light to guide me

I'll show that I can't be tamed
When I'm gone remember my name
And I won't give up the fight
Go gently into the night

[Post-Chorus]
I'm on my own, walking down this road alone
I'll go on, I'll be strong, all I need is my eternal dream

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus 3]
Turn every dream
Into reality
And through the dark they will be
The light to guide me
I'll show that I can't be tamed
When I'm gone remember my name
And I won't give up the fight
Go gently into the night

[Post-Chorus]
I'm on my own, walking down this road alone
I'll go on, I'll be strong, all I need is my eternal dream

[Outro]
I'll go on, I'll be strong alone
All I need is my eternal dream
