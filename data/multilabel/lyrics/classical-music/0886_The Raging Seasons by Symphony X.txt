From whom the Gods destroy they first make mad
Casting shadows on our fears
Malicious designs built strong and iron-clad
Catastrophic conclusion, judgment closes near

[Pre-Chorus]
Chaos sets the stage
Bitter mouths of violent rage
Spinning webs of timeless confusion
Help us find our way

[Chorus]
Tonight can we escape from this hell
(seasons raging - sands of time will fall)
Conquer the wicked
Tonight can we escape from ourselves

[Verse 2]
Ten-thousand tyrants preach their treachery
Striking down the weary and the wise
Swords of oppression sever the artery
Of our freedom, victimized

[Pre-Chorus]
Chaos sets the stage
Bitter mouths of violent rage
Spinning webs of timeless confusion
Help us find our way
You might also like[Chorus]
Tonight can we escape from this hell
(seasons raging - sands of time will fall)
Conquer the wicked
Tonight can we escape from ourselves

[Bridge]
Down-cast jaded, the glory has faded
So close your eyes
(locked in the darkness all your life...)
Dream a twisted tale - dark and venomous
(...do you really have a reason not to feel this raging season)
So infamous

Watch the raging inferno of serpents rip the flesh
From all your pride and glory
Then you die open your eyes, it's true

(Solo)

[Pre-Chorus]
Chaos sets the stage
Bitter mouths of violent rage
Spinning webs of timeless confusion
Help us find our way
[Chorus]
Tonight can we escape from this hell
(seasons raging - sands of time will fall)
Conquer the wicked
Tonight can we escape from ourselves
