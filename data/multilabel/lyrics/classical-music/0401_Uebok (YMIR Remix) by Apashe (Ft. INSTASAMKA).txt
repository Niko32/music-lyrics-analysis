Luck doesn't like me
They trynna wipe me
Five stars, I'm wanted
Fuck it, I'm hunted
Stole from Swarovsky
They brought the SWAT team
Check it, I'm bougee
Flash bomb, I'm blinded
Hands above my head now
Gun to my chest, ow
Eyes on my neckpiece
Skipping them heartbeats
Camos and Uzis
Bloodied and bruised me
No way to get out
Guess I'm bout to die, now

[Drop]
Run

[Bridge]

[Chorus: Ymir]
Holy shit, holy shit, yeah, I gotta run
Make a hit, make a hit, we're here for fun
Holy shit, holy shit, it's a hit and run
Make a hit, make a hit, like a machine gun
Holy shit, holy shit, yеah, I gotta run
Make a hit, make a hit, we'rе here for fun
Holy shit, holy shit, it's a hit and run
Make a hit, make a hit, like a machine gun
