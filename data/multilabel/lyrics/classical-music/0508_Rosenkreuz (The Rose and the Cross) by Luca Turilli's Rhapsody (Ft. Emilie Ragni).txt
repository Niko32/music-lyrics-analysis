Exsurge Domine

Ad aeterna
Contempla misera
Et aeterna lux

[Chorus]
Over Maya and its law
Feel the spirit
Hear its call
Free your mind for the new dawn
It's the time of the Rose and the Cross
Sun and Moon revealed his fate
While he crossed the quantum gate
Lived to serve the angels' word
It's the secret tale of Christian Rosenkreuz

[Verse 1]
They came inspired by wisdom
Twelve men to share all the glory of God
Searching for truth at the origin
Of that primordial great spiritual source
And they found the one
The newborn soul
Who went and saw
Came back and spoke

[Verse 2]
They filled his soul their knowledge
He filled their hearts with the grace of a Rose
Gleaming in his divine power
Forged by the pain of the old bleeding cross
And his death gave birth
To light and hope
While lead turned into shining gold

Muta il senso in prezioso oro
