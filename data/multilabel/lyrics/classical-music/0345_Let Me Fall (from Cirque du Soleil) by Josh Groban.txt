Let me fall, let me climb
There's a moment when fear and dream must collide

[Pre-Chorus]
Someone I am is waiting for courage
The one I want, the one I will become, will catch me

[Chorus]
So let me fall, if I must fall
I won't heed your warnings, I won't hear them
Let me fall, if I fall
Though the phoenix, may or may not rise

[Verse 2]
I â€‹will dance so freely, holding on to no one
You can hold me only if you too will fall
Away from all these useless fears and shame

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, someone I am is waiting for my courage
The one I want, the one I will become, will catch me

[Chorus]
So let me fall, if I must fall
I won't heed your warning, I won't hear
Let me fall, if I fall
There's no reason to miss this one chance
This perfect moment just let me fallYou might also like
