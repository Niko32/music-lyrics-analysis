As the circle forms tonight
And I take my place to execute my "right"
Call the filthy ones into my sight
Bring the sinners one by one
Stones of judgment shall avenge the things they've done
But then I raise my head and stare into the Son

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, then I feel my blood run cold
Eyes like the sharpest blade
That penetrate to the bottom of my soul

[Chorus]
Words of truth that cut so deep
You write the lines of mystery
I stumble and the stone I held in hand is cast away
When the mirror's shown to me
I see my own hypocrisy
And weep upon the writing in the sand

[Verse 2]
All the things I try to hide
All the times that I avoid your eyes
Thinking somehow I can live the lie
When the truth becomes too great
And I can't try to clean my rotten, filthy state
Or the hidden sins that doom me to my fate
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I can't hide it from Your sight
You search out the secret things, the darkest dreams
And reveal them in the light

[Chorus]
Words of truth that cut so deep
You write the lines of mystery
I stumble and the stone I held in hand is cast away
When the mirror's shown to me
I see my own hypocrisy
And weep upon the writing in the sand

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
When the writing in the sand has washed away (Has washed away)
I could never turn and walk the other way
For the words are carved into my very soul (Into my very soul)
And the light exposes everything I know
And all I've ever known
Let him who had no sin
Cast the first stone

[Pre-Chorus]
When the mirror's shown to me
I see my own hypocrisy
And weep upon the writing in the sand
[Chorus]
(Writing in the sand)
Words of truth that cut so deep
You write the lines of mystery
(Oh writing in the sand)
I stumble and the stone I held in hand is cast away
(Writing in the sand)
When the mirror's shown to me
I see my own hypocrisy
(Oh writing in the sand)
And weep upon the writing in the sand

Words of truth that cut so deep
You write the lines of mystery
I stumble and the stone I held in hand is cast away
