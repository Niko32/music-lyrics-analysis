I want to leave my house, and make a way to you
Follow, follow, any way, for you
Every time you go, I never thought of you
Sail away, let you go, no matter how you fly

Come to me, what are you
Summertime I liked
Ooh Ooh
Shadilay, Shadilay, you like to take my heart
Shadilay, Shadilay, my love
Shadilay, Shadilay, I want you for the night
Shadilay, Shadilay, my love

If you want my sample, and make a love together any more
If you want my sample, and make a love together any more

Shadilay, Shadilay, you like to take my heart
Shadilay, Shadilay, my love
Shadilay, Shadilay, I want you for the night
Shadilay, Shadilay, my love

If you want my sample, and make a love together any more
If you want my sample, and make a love together any more

Sound of feet every time, anywhere tonight
I can go look for you, with five against my 1
As I look, some are why, let's walk no farther
Talk to me, what are you
Summertime I liked
Ooh Ooh

Shadilay, Shadilay, you like to take my heart
Shadilay, Shadilay, my love
Shadilay, Shadilay, I want you for the night
Shadilay, Shadilay, my love

Shadilay, Shadilay, you like to take my heart
Shadilay, Shadilay, my love
Shadilay, Shadilay, I want you for the night
Shadilay, Shadilay, my love

If you want my sample, and make a love together any more
