I'll never find your soul
I'll never find it glowin' at all
I'll never find your soul
And deep inside me hopes
I see your soul, I hear your voice
I'll never find your soul

[Chorus]
I'll never find (Find) your soul
I'll never find it glow
I'll never find your soul
I'll never find, I'll never find your soul
I'll never find your soul, I'll never find it glow
I'll never find your soul

[Verse 2]
I'm sellin' myths tonight
Unspoken words, leave noise behind
I'll never find your soul
I keep its little neck
Were you my life to gain some raise
I'll never find your soul

[Chorus]
I'll never find (Find) your soul
I'll never find it glow
I'll never find your soul
I'll never find
Your soul
I'll never find your soul, I'll never find it glow
I'll never find your soul
I'll never find (I'll never find) your soul
I'll never find your soul, I'll never find it glow
I'll never find your soul, I'll never find your soul
I'll never find your soul, I'll never find it glow
I'll never find your soul, I'll never find your soul

I'll never find your soul, I'll never find your soul
I'll never find your soul (I'll never find your soul)
