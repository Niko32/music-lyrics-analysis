As we get bigger and bigger
The distance between ourselves
And that other outside world
Becomes smaller and smaller
And this world that we are inside
Which seems so huge in the beginning
And so infinitely welcoming
Has become very uncomfortable
And we are obliged to be born
And my father says that
Birth is so chaotic and violent
That he's sure that the moment of birth
We're all thinking
"This is it, this is death
This is the end of my life"
And then we're born
And it's a surprise 'cause its just the beginningYou might also like
