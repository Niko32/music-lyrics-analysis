[Verse 1]
Forever cursed by this game, he who plays with sin
Incantations summoned up our creations

We're players cast in this tale, believe it
Stranger than fiction
This justice thunders our condemnation

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling into innocence by a shadow's kiss
He speaks what mortals dare to say, will he betray?

[Chorus]
If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
From their fiery thrones screaming
Cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and greed
Watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game

[Verse 2]
We cannot keep our heads clear
Or our tongues from evil
By this sword, certain death at our own hands
You might also likeTo have no wants is divine - untrue!
Platinum waves tainted gold, we can only watch from
The shores

[Pre-Chorus]
Falling into innocence by a shadow's kiss
He speaks what mortals dare to say, will he betray?

[Chorus]
If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
From their fiery thrones screaming
Cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and greed
Watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game

(Solo)

[Chorus]
If you dare play the game -
Your descent preordained
From their fiery thrones screaming
Cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and greed
Watch him laugh as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game
(Solo)

[Chorus]
If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
From their fiery thrones screaming
Cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and greed
Watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game
