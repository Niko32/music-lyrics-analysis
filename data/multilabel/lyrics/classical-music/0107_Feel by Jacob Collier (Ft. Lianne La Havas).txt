Stay for a minute
Let me hold you in my heart
You love me, don't you baby?
So don't you rush away, rush away

[Pre-Chorus 1: Jacob Collier]
You and I, wide awake
With the sky falling down
As we wait for the morning
Is there a place in the stars
Where the sky goes to sleep?
We got no way of knowing

[Chorus: Lianne La Havas]
You make me feel (When it all falls down)
Feel (Turn it back around)
You make me feel (When it all falls down)
Feel (Turn it back around)
But you, you make me feel so young (So young, so young)
Yeah, you, you make me come alive (Alive)

[Post-Chorus: Jacob Collier, Lianne La Havas, Both]
This I do adore
Stay forever more
Take me to the floor
Leave me wanting more
Never felt this way before
You make me feel like I'm new
You might also like[Verse 2: Lianne La Havas]
Breathe for a moment
Let me wash away all your cares
(Let me wash away all your cares)
You know I got you baby
(Know I got you baby)
So don't you rush away, rush away (Rush away)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jacob Collier]
You and I, wide awake
With the sky falling down
In the dark of the morning
Is there a place in the sky
Where the stars go to sleep?
They've got no way of glowing

[Chorus: Lianne La Havas]
You make me feel (When it all falls down)
Feel (Turn it back around)
You make me feel (When it all falls down)
Feel (Turn it back around)
But you, you make me feel so young (So young, so young)
Yeah, you, you make me come alive (Alive)

[Post-Chorus: Jacob Collier, Lianne La Havas, Both]
This I do adore
Stay forever more
Take me to the floor
Leave me wanting more
I never felt this way before
You make me feel like I'm new
[Outro: Lianne La Havas]
You make me feel
You make it real
You make me feel
You make it real
