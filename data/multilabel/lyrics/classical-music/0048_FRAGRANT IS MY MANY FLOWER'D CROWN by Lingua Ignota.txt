God alone knows my sorrows

What will you say of the bond we had
Tender comrade?
For I have learned all men are brothers
And brothers only love each other

Brothers in arms
Brothers in each others' arms
All the love God would allow
But all God’s love means nothing now

The bitter blood of many foes sustains me
And heavy is my hammer, swinging 'round
And soft are their throats
And soft are their skulls
And fragrant is my many flower'd crown
Fragrant is my many flower’d crown
Crown, crown
(God alone knows my sorrow)
Fragrant is my many flower'd crown
(God alone knows my sorrow)
