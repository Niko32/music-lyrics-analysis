1st Verse:

Everybody wanna tell me how to live my life
But it's not for them to understand the love between me and my man
And after all the things that we've been through
Do they really think that I can walk away from you
Baby I'm tired, but you, you give me strength

Hook:
Can't stop lovin no no no baby ooh ooh
Can't stop lovin you no no no baby ooh ooh

2nd Verse:

I know you want me to have nice things to but
I can wait and have with you ooh and if it don't work out that way baby don't worry it's okay
And I know we may not have much but baby you're worth it we've got us
You better believe me when I tell you, cause what I'm bout to say to you see it's the truth
Everything that seems right to you
It might not be no good for you and though you may want him bad but he may be the best thing you never had
Hey ladies do you know what I'm talking about
When you got a good thing with a good man better keep him
Hey ladies do you know what I'm talking about
When you got a good thing with a good man better keep him
