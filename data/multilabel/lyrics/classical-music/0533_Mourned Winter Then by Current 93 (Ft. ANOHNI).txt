In the middle of harsh day
I saw the moon her
Beaming as the queen
Shook out her broken dawn
And kissed him tenderly
Shook down from her many stars
Drifting seeds to sleep sowing
Fields of spring clover dreaming of
A night bursting with milk and signs
Of coded silent planets, ices and suns
Touched her finger to her heart
And smiled, 'I am in you always'
The pulse in your blood the fire
In your salt the flame in your ghem
Like the night then full of all
Utter love, uttered spring
From the sleepless seas soaring
Over muddy towers grey graves
The hope light in your eyes
Moved open the spheres and spelled 'summer dust'
Heard that that jeweled night still open a thousand stars
Held your body like the wind
And felt the shudder of your mouth sing like Mars
Resurrect me in your stillness
With wing beats from the sunflowers
Towering over the diurnal leaves
Brush your kind face
With doves and starlings
Sweep down like bells on your kiss
If we count the cost of all we stole
Perfect earth, transcendent stars
Fog forget me not
Goddesses awake in trees and seafoam licked by the shells
And soaring gulls
In that beauty set in a hollow
World splits words and flies in the
Sapphire face and I too
Never shall, never forget that love
That first sang stars and
First sealed jars of lamb light
Planted groves of sparrow
The buzz of night under the sunny skull of mercy
Which breathed out your history
Before your eyes awoke to
'No proofs' or 'proofs'
'Letters' or 'no letters'
In the dead hand of dead papers
Which have long since left the central
Dance and in dull dull trance
Squealing I ate the feast and
Then I am the beast
And slid into the bloodstreams like a swamp
Nude to the word and the world
Naked to the ethereal city's sweep
And ate our home and throne
Spheres we are as free in
The night twined with vines
And sun babies, we are free
In the day lined with tiny moons
I awoke and stared at the sun
Falling into the mouths of those moons
Seagulls squawking and mouses
Squeaking of another world and other waves
Fox and vixen in the sunlit night inside
The moonlight palace and swift as birdsong
Smiled the bubble and guide us away
Spark flying out of the beaks soaring above
The stunted city brunched blindly under massed stars
Over the chalk hill driven on
By angelic yellsYou might also like
