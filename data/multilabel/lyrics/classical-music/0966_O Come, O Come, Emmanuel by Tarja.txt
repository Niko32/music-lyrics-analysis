To free your captive Israel
That mourns in lonely exile here
Until the Son of God appear
Rejoice! Rejoice! O Israel
To you shall come Emmanuel

Veni veni, Emmanuel
Captivum solve Israel
Qui gemit in exsilio
Privatus Dei Filio
Gaude! Gaude! Emmanuel
Nascetur pro te, Israel

O come, O come, great Lord of might
Who to Thy tribes, on Sinai's height
In ancient times once gave the law
In majesty and cloud and awe
Rejoice! Rejoice! O Israel
To you shall come Emmanuel
