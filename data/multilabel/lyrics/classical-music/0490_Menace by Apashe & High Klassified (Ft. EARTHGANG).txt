Playin' with narcotics, the optics ain't lookin' promising
Me and Bossy at the [?] talking Sudanese politics
Promise I'll give my all even when I'm high as the monument
Messages from galaxies away supplyin' the confidence
5k I spent this week on family I deserve head
I can't sleep I'm maniac, so much life I gotta live
Tell me how you profit off of profit in the tropics
I was double checkin' bank accounts in transit, man I lost it
Calling everything I had
Dancin' through the panic
How am I gon' manage couple racks of bandage that won't stop the bleeding
Nothin' in the cabinets
Rappers I make [?]
Split yo fuckin' cabbage
I'm the truest savage
Makes yo momma happy
Show 'em papa's magic
Show 'em I'm an addict
Show 'em how to add it
Crossin' me as tragic
Call the devil ask him, call up
Ask him, call up
Ask him, eatin' off the [?]
So antagonistic, product of [?]
This is Paris fashion
You might also like[Chorus]
Run through the city, I'm a menace
Keepin' out the biggest score ever
Take the wins and loss and equal measure
'Cause ain't no sympathy for the devil
Ru-ru-run through the city, I'm a menace
Keepin' out the biggest score ever
Take the wins and loss and equal measure
'Cause ain't no sympathy for the devil
(Yuh, yuh)

[Verse 2: Doctur Dot]
Fuck it, kill it, punch it, mash it
Gettin' classy [?]
I'ma bless me with the caption, raw action
If they askin', I'm the pappy
Give a fuck 'bout what ya' yappin'
I'ma know you by ya' actions
Pow-pow-pow let's see how fast you is
Meanwhile I'm makin' the racks
Keep count if I miss
You know my side and I'on look back
I leave yo' ass in the past
I ain't got nothin' to lose, but too much at stake
How a life end up like that?
I am a hustler, I beat the sun everyday
Say fuck it I rockin' my [?]
I'm at the fashion week, but it's all I had time
What I fuck up my evenin' in France (Yeah)
In a Corolla and a couple o' grams (Yeah)
Ain't no more talkin', you still in a trance (Yeah)
Ain't gonna lie, platinum plans (Yeah)
I gotta learn to stop fuckin' them fans (Yeah)
Life is a journey and death in the end (Yeah)
I'm really livin' the life you pretend (Hoo)

Run through the city, I'm a menace
Take the wins and loss and equal measure
'Cause ain't no sympathy for the devil

[Drop: ?]
Run through the city, I'm a menace
'Cause ain't no sympathy for the devil
Run through the city, I'm a menace
'Cause ain't no sympathy for the devil
Run through the city, I'm a menace
Keepin' out the biggest score ever
Take the wins and loss and equal measure
'Cause ain't no sympathy for the devil

[Drop: ? and ?]
Run through the city, I'm a menace
Keepin' out the biggest score ever
Take the wins and loss and equal measure
'Cause ain't no sympathy for the devil

[Outro]
I'm a menace
I'm a menace
