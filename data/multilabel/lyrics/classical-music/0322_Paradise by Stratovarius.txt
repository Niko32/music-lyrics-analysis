Late at night I find myself again (again, again, again)
Wondering and watching TV
I can't believe what's on the screen (the screen, the screen, the screen)
Something that I wouldn't care to see

[Verse 2]
Many rare species will perish soon
And we will be short on food
Why do we have to be so selfish
We've got to change our attitude

[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I am not
The only one that's worried
Why don't we all
Wake up, and realize

[Chorus]
Like the birds in the sky, we're flying so high
Without making any kind of sacrifice
We've got so little time to undo this crime
Or we'll lose our paradise

[Verse 3]
It seems to me that there's no sense at all
Nobody cares it's always the same
Mother nature's crying out in pain
We are the one's to blame
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I know that I am not
The only one that's worried
Why don't we all
Wake up, and realize

[Chorus]
Like the birds in the sky, we're flying so high
Without making any kind of sacrifice
We've got so little time to undo this crime
Or we'll lose our paradise

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
Like the birds in the sky, we're flying so high
Without making any kind of sacrifice
We've got so little time to undo this crime
Or we'll lose our paradise

[Chorus]
Like the birds in the sky, we're flying so high
Without making any kind of sacrifice
We've got so little time to undo this crime
Or we'll lose our paradise
[Outro]
Like the birds in the sky, we're flying so high
We've got so little time to undo this crime
Or we'll lose our paradise
Oh, so high
