It's not the red of the dying sun
The morning sheets surprising stain
It's not the red of which we bleed
The red of cabernet sauvignon
A world of ruby all in vain
It's not that red, It's not that red
It's not that red, It's not that red

[Verse 2]
It's not as golden as Zeus famous shower
It doesn't, not at all, come from above
It's in the open but it doesn't get stolen
It's not that gold
It's not as golden as memory
Or the age of the same name
It's not that gold, It's not that gold
It's not that gold, It's not gold at all

[Chorus]
I wish this would be your colour
I wish this would be your colour
I wish this would be your colour
Your colour, I wish

[Instrumental Bridge]
You might also like[Chorus]
I wish this would be your colour
I wish this would be your colour
I wish this would be your colour
Your colour, I wish

[Verse 3]
It is as black as Malevich's Square
The cold furnace in which we stare
A high pitch on a future scale
It is a starless winternight's tale
It suits you well
It is that black, It is that black
It is that black, It is that black

[Chorus]
I wish this would be your colour
I wish this would be your colour
(I wish this would be your colour)
I wish this would be your colour
(I wish this would be your colour)
I wish this would be your colour
(I wish this would be your colour)
I wish this would be your colour
(I wish this would be your colour)
I wish this would be your colour
(I wish this would be your colour)
I wish this would be your colour
(I wish this would be your colour)
I wish this would be your colour
(I wish this would be your colour)
I wish this would be your colour
(I wish this would be your colour)
I wish this would be your colour
(I wish this would be your colour)
Your colour, I wish
