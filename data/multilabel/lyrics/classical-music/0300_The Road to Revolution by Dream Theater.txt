He only sees what he desires to see
It took a while but finally he agreed
Though everything did not turn out as planned
If love's a risk, it's worth a chance

[Gabriel]
I know where there is faith there's always hope
We'll meet beneath the stars at Heaven's Cove

Where ghosts of yesterday
Once filled the lighted stage
Taking our first step down a new road

[Daryus]
Arhys, time is running out!
What will your decision be?
If you still have any doubt
Think about Evangeline

[Arhys]
On the road to revolution
Our salvation's never free
There's a price for liberation
When you stand for your beliefs
You might also likeWhen the man in the mirror
Takes a long hard look at me
Will the person staring back
Be the man I want to be?

[Nafaryus]
Change my mind?
A waste of time
For soon he will be mine

[Ensemble]
Open eyes
Help me see which choice is right
