Subject beautiful
Love everything about her
When tears are falling and hit the ground
They bounce up to heaven and send angels down

[Bridge]
Whose words cuts through
The heart of you?
Who's standing sure
And can't detour?
Who passed the test?
I confess you must be the best

[Chorus]
And it's true
I love everything about you
Condition is true
I love everything about you
Everything about your movements
Everything about your style
Everything about thе way your touch has purpose and desire

[Scatting]

[Verse 2]
Subjеct beautiful
Knows how to get inside the heart
If I saw her future would I run a mile
What's perceived as pain can be another's high

Subject beautiful
Washing my face and hands again
I can never tell how it will be this time
Just another touch and I will be all right (Yeah)

[Bridge]
Who saved the best
For you, the blessed?
Who's standing tall
For one and all?
The voice is you
And it's clear as the morning dew

[Chorus]
And it's true (True)
I love everything about you
Everything about your movements
Everything about your style
Everything about the way your touch has purpose and desire
Condition is true
Condition is true
I love everything about you (Yeah)

[Scatting]
[Chorus]
True
I love everything about you
Condition is true
I love everything about you
Everything about your movements
Everything about your style
Everything about the way your touch has purpose and desire (Yeah)
