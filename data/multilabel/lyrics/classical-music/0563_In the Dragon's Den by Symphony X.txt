[Verse 1]
Placid skies
Through crystal gazing eyes
Slaves to our desire
In a ring of smoke and fire
The dungeons call
Two faces on the wall
Candles light the way
For a moonlight serenade

[Refrain]
Through the nights and days
We will find a way
A way to carry on what we believe

[Verse 2]
An empty door
Ashes on the floor
Hypnotic array of lights
Dragons calling throughout the night
Omen in black
Chained down to the rack
The end never in sight
Soaring through an endless plight
You might also like[Refrain]
Through the nights and days
We will find a way (find a way)

[Chorus]
Silence fills the shrine
Giving us the sign
Forever lost
Forever in the dragon's den
Born with second sight
Essence burning bright
Forever lost
Forever in the dragon's den

[Guitar/Keyboard Solos]

[Chorus]
Silence fills the shrine
Giving us the sign
Forever lost
Forever in the dragon's den
Born with second sight
Essence burning bright
Forever lost
Forever in the dragon's den
