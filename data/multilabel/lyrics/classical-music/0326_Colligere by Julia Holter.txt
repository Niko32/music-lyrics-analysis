Even even even if a shape
If a dry fresco
Smoky yellow mixed with what is left behind

[Verse 2]
She's a hero dressed in steel
Arrived on the land
In the aviary of my early mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
What I gather is a lot of wings I gathered
What I didn't know is how so bright

[Chorus 1]
How so dazzling is
How angel

[Post-Chorus]
In the new room, I wondered if they were gone
But the light's on
Visitations can be overwhelming
Wings fly wall to wall

[Verse 3]
Creature creature grow more vividly than before
Loosed of construction and changes sides flip the chair
Like the scene fifteen seconds years all stop the door
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
I'm so illogical when she comes and spoke
Flying paint flakes and the rot
Fear of drowning takes over the simple face

[Chorus 2]
I once touched the
Simple face
