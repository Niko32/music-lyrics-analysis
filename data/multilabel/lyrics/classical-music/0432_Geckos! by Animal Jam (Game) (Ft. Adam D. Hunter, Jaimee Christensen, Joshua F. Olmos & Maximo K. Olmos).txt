[Bridge]
Geckos live on every continent except Antarctica
Most geckos can make their tails fall off to escape danger
Geckos don't have eyelids so they lick their eyeballs to keep them clean
Many geckos can blend into their surroundings to avoid being eaten
Geckos have tiny bristles on their toes to help them stick to almost every surface
There are more than a thousand species of geckos in the world
