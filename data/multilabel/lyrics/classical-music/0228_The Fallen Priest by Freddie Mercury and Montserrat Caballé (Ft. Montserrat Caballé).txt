Free me, free yourself
A life of sacrifice controlled me
But those promises I made no longer hold me
Mercurial more wayward by the hour
The shackles fall away, I'm in your power
Free me, and free yourself
Come to me and let me lead you
I beg you, I beseech you to let go
My heaven is yours and heaven is all I know

[Chorus – Freddie & Montserrat]
We are mortal
In the hands of gods who roll the dice
Searching for an earthly paradise
So hard to find
We are mortal
We are victims of our weaknesses and passion
We are reaching for the heights
(I am falling, I am falling from the heights)

[Orchestral Section]

[Verse 2 – Freddie & Montserrat]
But I promised I would serve
I should be a rock against depravity and sin
Oh no sin, no sin
Free yourself, let your life begin, oh
To yourself be true
I am a man of God
I should not be here with you, ah

Free me we are mortal, ah
Come a little closer to the fire
To love and live that one desire
Denial of that love is treason
The love that we make
The force of our lives and its reason

[Chorus – Freddie & Montserrat]
We are mortal
In the hands of gods who roll the dice
Searching for an earthly paradise
So hard to find, yeah yeah
We are mortal
Victims of our weaknesses and passion
(I am falling, I am falling we, we are mortal)

[Post-Chorus – Freddie & Montserrat]
Why do I believe in you
You're destroying my world
Hold nothing back
Give me all there is
I want it all
This is where we stand
This is all there is
Prisoners of each others love
Yes, I want it all
