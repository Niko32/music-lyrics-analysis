Freefall
I let myself freefall
Into your arms
Into the shape of the love we created
Our emotional hammock

[Verse 2]
Safe inside the fabric of our
Love-woven membrane

[Verse 3]
Everytime we kiss
Share songs and films
Hike mountains and beaches
Our joined presence gains form
Our affections
Captured in a structure
Visceral sculpting
Of our love into space

[Verse 4]
If we cling to what we used to be
It will burn our soul
We will get hurt
Unless therе is absolute trust
Then we will bеcome one
Become one

Our solar systems coalesced
Softly surrendered into itself
Formed a nebulous cloud
A gentle meeting of gas and dust
We amalgamate
Arctic persian compassionate
Illuminate, illuminate
Illuminate, illuminate
Illuminate, illuminate
Illuminate, illuminate
Illuminate, illuminate
Illuminate, illuminate
