[Chorus: The Star-Spangled Banner]
O, the land of the free
And the home of the brave
Are your stars still so bright
Does your banner still wave?

O, the land of the free
And the home of the brave
Are you heaven on Earth
Or the gloom of the grave?

[1. Verse: Milan Fras]
You, the people of the United States
Did you form a perfect union
Establish justice
Insure tranquility
Secure the blessings of liberty
To yourselves and your posterity?

How blind can you get
For your country - right or wrong
America - the melting pot!

[Chorus: The Star-Spangled Banner]
O, the land of the free
And the home of the brave
Are your stars still so bright
Does your banner still wave?
O, the land of the free
And the home of the brave
Are you heaven on Earth
Or the gloom of the grave?

[Sample: Preacher]
"We children, we children are born in sin! We are born in sin and that's why we must let the light of god, the light of god into our heart, children. We all are children of god, but [?] we are sinners. We are sinners! We must let the light, let the love of god, the eternal love of god into our hearts. Or we will burn, burn in hell, burn in eternal hell!"

[2. Verse: Milan Fras]
Praise the lord
And praise the Holy Spirit
To save us from your freedom
Justice, peace, accordance and illusion
From arrogance and pride
From violence and confusion

Your great despair
And great depression
Satanic verses of your superstition
The land of plenty

Your Bill of Rights, the enterprise
The free will and the unbroken one
Your self-esteem and self-desire
Your trust in God and the religious fire

The end of history
The end of time
The end of family
The end of crime
