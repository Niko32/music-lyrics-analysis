Spread your wings to dark horizons
Fly where the twilight reigns
Mighty Tharos cross the line of hell
It's so near

[Chorus]
Lost in the shadow I search for my sun
Fly and face it before the new moon
There where chaos rules

[Break]
Domine deterges nubila caelo
Bellator a proposito non deterreres
Unholy vision, ancestral terror
Spare my mind, my innocent eyes

[Instrumental Break]

[Spoken â€“ Aresius]
"And suddenly the unreal silence is broken by a lament
A lament coming up from the deepest, darkest abyss...
And from the seven gates of the dark fortress the dead
Come back to life to face him... This is hell!"

[Verse 2]
Immortal fire now
Light my heart, light my way
Face the old legend
The Guardian of Space and Time

[Verse 3]
Living dead on black winged demons
Fly high to play with your head
Gothic portals, mystic towers
Between the dark clouds

[Chorus]
Lost in the shadow I search for my sun
Fly and face it before the new moon
There where chaos rules
