She,knows there are few never go
Bent out of the screen light
And no need to keep down

Nobody else is watching now
Finally the neighbors have turned their lights out
How did it ever get to disarm
Boost your special force to the ground

She,internees and takes a glow
She,knows there are few never go
Bent out of the screen light
And no need to keep down

She has inferred so free to fall
She who's until her feed the sore
Bent out of the screen light
And no need to keep down

Nobody else is watching now
Finally the neighbors have turned their lights out
How did it ever get to disarm
Boost your special force to the groundYou might also like
