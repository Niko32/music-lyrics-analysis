- the forbidden portrait confined to it's frame
Unbroken silence
- a total misfortune and shame

Ragin obsession - this mask of oppression
It hides your agression from view
This tearing suture renounces
The love he once knew

Your sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth
You disguise your insolence
Don't deny insanity - mediocrity

Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

A fallen fortress sees him beneath starless skies
Subsiding deeper - the final farewell in his eyes

Unspoken hero
- distrusted and thrusted within surmise
Seizing intrusion to unveil his clever disguise
You might also likeYour sacrifice this paradise of innocence
Trust the lie - you falsify the line of truth

Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

(solo)

Save us from this masquerade of lies
Kings and fools die in ridicule (save us)
Save us from this masquerade of lies

2. A Winter's Dream - Prelude (Part I) (3:03)

(Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Allen)

Although your words are empty
I can hear now, what you feel inside

The night is drawing closer
You fell you have to hide

Your fears are never wrong or right
Everything is either black or white
It's time to close your eyes now
Begin your fantasy - what does it mean?
Wake your dreams (commence now...)
Into reality

Your fears are never wrong or right
Everything is either black or white

In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you
In a Winter's Dream - I'll be there for you

3. The Damnation Game (4:32)

(Music: Romeo, Pinnela, Miller, Rullo and Allen)

Forever cursed by this game, he who plays with sin
Incantations summoned up our creations

We're players cast in this tale, believe it
Stranger than fiction
This justice thunders our condemnation

Falling into innocence by a shadow's kiss
He speaks what mortals dare to say, will he betray?

If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
From their fiery thrones screaming
Cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and gree
Watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game
We can not keep our heads clear
Or our tongues from evil
By this sword, certain death at our own hands

To have no wants is divine - untrue!
Platinum waves tainted gold, we can only watch from
The shores

Falling into innocence by a shadow's kiss
He speaks what mortals dare to say, will he betray?

If you dare play the game - your descent preordained
From their fiery thrones screaming
Cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breathing fire and gree
Watch him jest as you bleed...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game

(solos)

If you dare play the game -
Your descent preordained
From their fiery thrones screaming
Cursing your name
On the terror it breeds - breating fire and greed
Watch him laugh as you bledd...
Screaming enter the Damnation Game

(SOLO)

(Chorus)
