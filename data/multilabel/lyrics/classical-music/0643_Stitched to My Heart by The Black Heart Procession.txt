My heart is bleeding rain drops
They're lonely rain drops
When it used to shower all night long
And in the well they'll find my heart
That I gave to you

My heart is bleeding rain drops
They're lonely rain drops
When it used to shower all night long
And in the well they'll find my heart
That I gave to you

[Refrain]
And in the end they'll find your name
Stitched to my heart
Stitched to my heart

[Bridge]
I've been locked away
I'll keep locked away
I'll keep locked away
Where they'll find no trace
I'll keep locked away
Where they'll find no trace
You might also like[Refrain]
And in the well they'll find my heart
That I gave to you
And in the end they'll find her name
Stitched to my heart
And in the end they'll find her name
Stitched to my heart
Stitched to my heart
(Stitched to my heart)

[Outro]
They're lonely rain drops
They're lonely rain drops
They're lonely rain drops
