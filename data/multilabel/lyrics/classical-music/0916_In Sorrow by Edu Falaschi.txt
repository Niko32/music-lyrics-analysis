Now I miss your smiles
Shining like the sea
Eden sank to grief so dawn goes down
I'd wish for you to blossom as a lily
Dance in the wind and spread your colours into me, forevermore

[Verse 2]
Where are you?
Moonlight Queen don't cry
Through the seven seas I will deep dive
On my way!

[Chorus]
I roam (I roam), believing on my ways (On my ways)
When nights are full of clouds (Nights full of clouds)
Riding waves I reign (The waves I reign)
In sorrow, glowing (In sorrow) bright in the darkest days (The darkest days)
Your life just lead my heart (Just lead my heart)
Drowned in seas of pain (Thе seas of pain)
High up in the sky

[Piano Solo and Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I roam (I roam), beliеving on my ways (On my ways)
When nights are full of clouds (Nights full of clouds)
Riding waves I reign (The waves I reign)
In sorrow, glowing (In sorrow) bright in the darkest days (The darkest days)
Your life just lead my heart (Just lead my heart)
Drowned in seas of pain (The seas of pain)
High up in the sky (The sky)
Believe in your own ways (In your own ways)
When nights are full of clouds (Nights full of clouds)
Riding waves I reign (The waves I reign)
'Till the sorrow die

Wailing in the night
Blades run through my tears
Warlike woes just
Open up the scars
Running all the plagues out of my dreams
My Queen
