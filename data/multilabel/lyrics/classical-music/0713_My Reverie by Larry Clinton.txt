Our love is a dream, but in my reverie
I can see that this love was meant to be
Only a poor fool never schooled in the whirlpool
Of romance could be so cruel as you are to me
My dreams are as worthless as tin to me
Without you, life will never begin to be
So love me as I love you in my reverie
Make my dream a reality, let's dispense with formality
Come to me in my reverieYou might also like
