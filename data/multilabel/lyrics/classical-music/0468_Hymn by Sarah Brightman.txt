And the mountain so high
If you want to see God
You've got to move on the other side
You stand up there
With your head in the clouds
Don't try to fly
You know you might not come down
Don't try to fly, dear God
You might not come down

Jesus came down from Heaven to earth
The people said it was a virgin birth
Jesus came down from Heaven to earth
The people said it was a virgin birth
The people said it was a virgin birth

He told great stories of the Lord
And said he was the saviour of us all
He told great stories of the Lord
And said he was the saviour of us all
And said he was the saviour of us all

For this we killed him
And nailed him up high
He rose again as if to ask us why
Then he ascended into the sky
As if to say in God alone you soar
As if to say in God alone we fly
You might also likeValley's deep
And the mountain so high
If you want to see God
You've got to move on the other side
You stand up there
With your head in the clouds
Don't try to fly
You know you might not come down
Don't try to fly, dear God
You might not come down
