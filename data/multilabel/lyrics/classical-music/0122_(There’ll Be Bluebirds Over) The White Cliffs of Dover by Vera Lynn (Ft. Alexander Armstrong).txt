There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see
[Verse 1]
I'll never forget the people I met
Braving those angry skies
I remember well as the shadows fell
The light of hope in their eyes
And though I'm far away
I still can hear them say
"Thumbs up!"
For when the dawn comes up

[Chorus]
There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see
There'll be love and laughter
And peace ever after
Tomorrow, when the world is free

[Bridge]
The shepherd will tend his sheep
The valley will bloom again
And Jimmy will go to sleep
In his own little room again

I may not be near, but I have no fear
History will prove it too
When the tale is told
It will be as of old
For truth will always win through;
But be I far or near
That slogan still I'll hear
"Thumbs up!"
For when the dawn comes up

[Chorus]
There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see
[Verse 3]
When night shadows fall, I'll always recall
Out there across the sea
Twilight falling down on some little town
It's fresh in my memory
I hear mother pray
And to her baby say
"Don't cry!"
This is her lullaby
[Chorus]
There'll be bluebirds over
The white cliffs of Dover
Tomorrow, just you wait and see
