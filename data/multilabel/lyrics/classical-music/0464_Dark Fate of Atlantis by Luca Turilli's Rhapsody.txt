[Verse 1]
Thousands of years ago, at the limits of our world
A new kingdom rose on water, a new golden age for all
Human minds or entities, sons of astral infinity
But for sure the great Poseidon found his people and his throne

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Old world, to you we all belonged
Old world, the stars announced your fall
Ignotum fatum

[Verse 2]
Monumental growth, breaking rules of history
The lost continent was legend, soon the legend became myth
Power, strength, prosperity, once too close to divinity
Until water became fire and swallowed all its lore

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Old world, the Icarus’ last fault
Old world, your fate lives on and on
Ignotum fatum

[Chorus]
Dark mantis, dark fate of Atlantis
At the gates of a timeless dimension
Dwell the ghosts of a myth not forgotten
Kept by the sirens and their infinite cry
(Infinite dark mantis)
The one surviving the ocean’s might
(The ocean's might)
Dark mantis, dark fate of Atlantis
At the gates of a timeless dimension
Dwell the ghosts of a myth not forgotten
Kept by the sea lords and their infinite force
(Infinite dark mantis)
The one surviving the Gods’ remorse
(Surviving the Gods' remorse)

[Bridge]
Vita e morte in quell’umana vis
Che vibra ed arde vivida nei secoli

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Old world, to you we all belonged
Old world, the stars announced your fall
Ignotum fatum

[Chorus]
Dark mantis, dark fate of Atlantis
At the gates of a timeless dimension
Dwell the ghosts of a myth not forgotten
Kept by the sirens and their infinite cry
(Infinite dark mantis)
The one surviving the ocean’s might
(The ocean's might)
Dark mantis, dark fate of Atlantis
At the gates of a timeless dimension
Dwell the ghosts of a myth not forgotten
Kept by the sea lords (sea lords!) and their infinite force
(Infinite dark mantis)
The one surviving the Gods’ remorse
(Surviving the Gods' remorse)
[Outro]
Dark mantis, dark fate of Atlantis
