She stares through my shadow
She sees something more
Believes there's a light in me, she is sure

[Pre-Chorus]
And her truth makes me stronger
Does she realize
I awake every morning
With her strength by my side

[Chorus]
I am not a hero
I am not an angel
I am just a man
Man who's trying to love her
Unlike any other
In her eyes I am

[Verse 2]
This world keeps on spinning
Only she steals my heart
She's my inspiration, she's my northern star

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't count my possession
All I call mine
I will give her completely
To the end of all time
You might also like[Chorus]
I am not a hero
I am not an angel
I am just a man
Man who's trying to love her
Unlike any other
In her eyes I am

[Bridge]
In her eyes, I see the sky and all I'll ever need
In her eyes, time passes by, and she is with me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Chorus]
I am not a hero
I am not an angel
I am just a man
Man who's trying to love her
Unlike any other
In her eyes I am
In her eyes I am
