If I asked you now
Will you be my prince?
Will you lay down your armour
And be with me forever?

[Pre-Chorus]
When you open me
All the power in me moves
How you want to see
All the depths of me real
When you open me
All the power in me moves

[Chorus]
I feel real
I love you, love you
I love you, love you

[Verse 2]
When I look into your eyes
There's a danger inside
When I see the edge
I can never hide
See me running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
Running, running, running, running, running
To you, from you, to you

There's a strange love inside
It's getting louder, and louder, and louder, and louder, and louder
There's a danger I can't hide
Who I am, it's who I am
It's who I am, it's who I am

[Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love, I'm in love

[Bridge]
Gonna build you up, gonna help you believe sonny
Gonna build you up, gonna help you believe sonny
[Pre-Chorus]
There's a strange love inside
It's getting louder, and louder, and louder, and louder, and louder
There's a danger I can't hide
Oh, It's who I am, it's who I am
It's who I am, it's who I am

[Chorus]
I'm in love, I'm in love
