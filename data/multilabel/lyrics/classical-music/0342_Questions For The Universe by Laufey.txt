Why do I love the moon so much
How come I crave a stranger's touch
Lately love's been like a curse
I speak my mind and don't think first

[Refrain]
These are my questions for the universe

[Verse 2]
Why do I sleep all day and night
Live in this puzzling age and time
Why would I kiss a boy just to get hurt
Plant a living flower on this dying earth

[Refrain]
These are my questions for the universe

[Bridge]
Falling in love feels more like crashing
Stars spin around my head so I'm asking

[Verse 3]
Will my worries ever melt away
Run out of sentences to say
Wish that I could put this into bettеr words
Will I ever fall in love or will I always sеarch
You might also like[Refrain]
These are my questions for the universe

[Outro]
These are my questions for the universe
