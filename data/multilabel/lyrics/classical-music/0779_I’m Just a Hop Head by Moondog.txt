I started hopping when first I hopped into bed
I took up hop scotch, which had me hopping all day;
But that was kid stuff, and soon I put it away
I took up fishing, and when the river was low
I took to hopping from stone to stone, fish or no

As I grew older I took up sailing at sea;
Went island-hopping, a navigational spree
I´m now a space-man; my flying saucer is fast
Though slow in coming, I´m planet-hopping, at last
I´ve reached my limit; no wider worlds to be won
I´m so unhappy, I wish I´d never begunYou might also like
