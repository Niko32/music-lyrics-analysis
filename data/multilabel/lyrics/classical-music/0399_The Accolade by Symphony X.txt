[Verse 1]
Into the morning sun
Down his chosen road he rides to save the world
Cross of crimson, robe of white
Sworn to the quest for the rest of his life
Play shields and wooden swords
Slaying dragons as a knight of Arthur's Court
Trained to kill, to sing a song
Youthful hope to right the wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
Sons of Antioch, an angel's voice cries out to him
Free the holy lands, bring peace to it again

[Chorus]
Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever

[Bridge]
A heart of gold pumps within his metal skin
A noble line he carries on

[Verse 2]
Braving the bloody din
Silver spurs are justly earned by strength within
Squire to knight, like prince to king
Chalice of life completes the ring

[Pre-Chorus]
Into the morning sun
Down his chosen road he rides to save the world

[Chorus]
Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever
Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
To see the light
He spent his life to understand
The sword he once held tight
Falls forever from his hands
[Chorus]
Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever
Across the seas through sands of time
Knight of the Templar
A charging steed through lands unkind
A legend forever
