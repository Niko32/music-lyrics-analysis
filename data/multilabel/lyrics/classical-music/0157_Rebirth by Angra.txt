Cooling breeze from a summer day
Hearing echoes from your heart
Learning how to recompose the words
Let time just fly
Joyful seagulls roaming on the shore
Not a single note will sound
Raise my head after I dry my face
Let time just fly

[Verse 1]
Recalling, retreating
Returning, retrieving
A small talk you're missing
More clever, but older now
A leader, a learner
A lawful beginner
A lodger of lunacy
So lucid in the jungle
A helper, a sinner
A scarecrow's agonizing smile

[Verse 2]
Woah-oh, minutes go round and round
Inside my head
Woah-oh, my chest will now explode
Falling into pieces
Rain breaks on the ground-blood
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
(Laudamus te, Omnipotens
No! No!)
One minute forever
(No! No!)
A sinner regretting
(No! No!)
My vulgar misery ends

[Chorus]
(And I) Ride the winds of a brand new day
High where mountains stand
Found my hope and pride again
Rebirth of a man

[Post-Chorus]
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
And I ride the winds of a brand new day
High where mountains stand
Found my hope and pride again
Rebirth of a man
[Outro]
Time to fly
