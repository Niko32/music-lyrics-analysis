Look at the world: and marvel everyday
Look at the world: So many joys and wonders
So many miracles along our way
Praise to thee o lord for all creation
Give us thankful hearts that we may see
All the gifts we share and every blessing
All things come of thee
Look at the earth: Bringing forth fruit and flower
Look at the sky: The sunshine and the rain
Look at the hills, look at the trees and mountains
Valley and flowing river field and plain
Praise to thee o lord for all creation
Give us thankful hearts that we may see
All the gifts we share and every blessing
All things come of thee
Think of the spring, Think of the warmth of summer
Bringing the harvest before the winters cold
Everything grows, everything has a season
Til' it is gathered to the fathers fold
Praise to thee o lord for all creation
Give us thankful hearts that we may see
All the gifts we share and every blessing
All things come of thee
Every good gift, all that we need and cherish
Comes from the lord in token of his love
We are his hands, stewards of all his bounty
His is the earth and his the heavens above
Praise to thee, o lord for all creation
Give us thankful hearts that we may see
All the gifts we share, and every blessing
All things come of thee
All things come of theeYou might also like
