Like a cloud, ushered in by wind
You're just a reaction to my confusion
A hybrid of hundreds of troubles
People felt us connect and ran for shelter

And there are blackouts in LA tonight
There's an evident lack of light tonight
An increase in desire, you´ll catch me
Hanging out on a wire
Cutting the voltage to your power line
(And the lights go, out)

No electricity...

Like a love, ushered in by bliss
You came to me like a realization
But your look could sharpen a knife
Now all I hear is tearing of paper

And there are blackouts in L.A. tonight
An evident lack of light tonight
An increase in desire, you´ll catch me
Hanging out on a wire
Cutting the voltage to your power line
(And the lights go, out)

Now you, cannot affect me
I feel, no electricity
Now you, cannot control me
I feel, no electricity

Now you, cannot affect me
I feel, no electricity
Now you, cannot control me
I feel, no electricity

And the lights go, out

And there are blackouts in L.A. tonight
There's an evident lack of light tonight
