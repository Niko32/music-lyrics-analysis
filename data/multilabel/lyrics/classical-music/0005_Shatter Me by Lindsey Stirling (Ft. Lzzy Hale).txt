I pirouette in the dark
I see the stars through a mirror
Tired mechanical heart
Beats 'til the song disappears

[Chorus]
Somebody shine a light
I'm frozen by the fear in me
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me
So cut me from the line
Dizzy, spinning endlessly
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me

[Drop]

[Post-Chorus]
Shatter me
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me

[Verse 2]
If only the clockwork could speak
I wouldn't be so alone
We burn every magnet and spring
And spiral into the unknown
You might also like[Chorus]
Somebody shine a light
I'm frozen by the fear in me
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me
So cut me from the line
Dizzy, spinning endlessly
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me

[Drop]

[Post-Chorus]
Shatter me
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me

[Bridge]
If I break the glass, then I'll have to fly
There's no one to catch me if I take a dive
I'm scared of changing, the days stay the same
The world is spinning but only in gray
If I break the glass, then I'll have to fly
There's no one to catch me if I take a dive
I'm scared of changing, the days stay the same
The world is spinning but only in gray
(Only, only, only, only, only)
[Chorus]
Somebody shine a light
I'm frozen by the fear in me
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me
So cut me from the line
Dizzy, spinning endlessly
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me

[Drop]

[Post-Chorus]
Shatter me
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me
