Dance, dance your decay
All the while unknowing that you're led astray
Sleep, sleep through your woe
While your voice slowly withers and melts away

[Chorus]
Sing, sing unto me
The pleasure and the pain
Reveal to me
The reasons my love's not in vain

[Verse 2]
Sangre, sangre de la rosa
Sigue en paz sin el pasado
Recé, recé por su alma
Ella morirá en el battesimo del fuego

[Chorus]
Sing, sing unto me
The pleasure and the pain
Reveal to me
The reasons my love's not in vain

[Bridge]
The world burns, but still we breathe
The iron chambered heart a sieve
That sifts through honest elegance
And suffers from the wrong defense
The world burns, but still we breathe
The iron chambered heart a sieve
That sifts through honest elegance
And suffers from the wrong defenseYou might also like
