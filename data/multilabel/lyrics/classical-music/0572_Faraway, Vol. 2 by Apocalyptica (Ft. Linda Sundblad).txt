You're always somewhere else
Feelings have deserted me
To a point of no return

I don't believe in God but I pray for you

[Chorus]
Don't you slip away from me
It's you I live for, don't you leave
Don't you slip away from me
I'm vulnerable to your love

Don't let them get you, stay away from the sun
It's too bright for you
Are you eyes getting blurry?
Still, I'm crying your name

I don't believe in God but I pray for you

[Chorus]
Don't you slip away from me
It's you I live for, don't you leave, no
Don't you slip away from me
I'm vulnerable to your love
You might also likeThere is something in the way
You're always somewhere else
Feelings have deserted me
To a point of no return

So the light fades out at you, so close to lose it

[Chorus]
Don't you slip away from me
It's you I live for, don't you leave, no
Don't you slip away from me
I'm vulnerable to your love

Don't you slip away from me
It's you I live my life for, no, don't leave
Don't you slip away from me
I'm vulnerable to your love

Don't you slip away
