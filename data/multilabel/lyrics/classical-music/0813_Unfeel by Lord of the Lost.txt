Can't eat or sleep, I just ache, oh, oh-oh
This loss, now all I own
So pain had just been postponed
I crawl through darkest depths alone

Unravel my heart
Untravel the stars
In silence I'm counting my scars

I cannot unfeel what I feel for you
I cannot untell 'cause I told the truth
I cannot unsee what I've seen in you
I cannot unfall how far I've fallen for you
I cannot unbe or unkneel or unsee or unfeel
What I feel for you

Unspoken woes devastate, oh, oh-oh
Felled by this knife twist of fate, oh, oh-oh
The life that you've disowned
It cuts me deep to the bone
A love the like of which I unown

Unravel my heart
Untravel the stars
In silence I'm counting my scars
You might also likeI cannot unfeel what I feel for you
I cannot untell 'cause I told the truth
I cannot unsee what I've seen in you
I cannot unfall how far I've fallen for you
I cannot unbe or unkneel or unsee or unfeel
What I feel for you

Each corner I turn
The memories burn
From fountain to bell house and square
These landmarks I see
From our history
Are eyesores when you are not there
Each wish that I make
For eternal days
Before the storm tears us apart

Unravel my heart
Untravel the stars
In silence I'm counting my scars

I cannot unfeel what I feel for you
I cannot untell 'cause I told the truth
I cannot unsee what I've seen in you
I cannot unfall how far I've fallen for you
I cannot unbe or unkneel or unsee or unfeel
What I feel for you
