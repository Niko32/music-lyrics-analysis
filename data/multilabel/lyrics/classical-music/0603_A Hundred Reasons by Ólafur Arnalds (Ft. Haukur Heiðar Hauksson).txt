From around your eyes
It takes me quite a while to smile
When all is said and done
Is this the end?
No, this is where we find
A hundred reasons not to grow apart
Not to grow apart
We’ll never break apart

I will follow you into this
I will make sure we stay right here
I will find a way to stay alive
I will follow you into this
I will make sure we’ll stay right here
I will find a way to stay alive
I will follow you into the end

The laughter and the lie
In our life
That is where I find
A hundred reasons why

I will follow you into this
I will make sure we’ll stay right here
I will find a way to stay alive
I will follow you into this
I will make sure we’ll stay right here
I will find a way to stay alive
I will find a way to stay alive
You might also likeI will follow you the way back home
I will find a way to stay alive
I will follow you to the end
I will make sure we’ll stay right
I will find a way to stay alive
I will follow you into this
I will make sure we’ll stay right here
I will find away to stay alive
I will follow you into this
I will make sure we’ll stay right here
I will find a way to stay alive
I will follow you into the void
