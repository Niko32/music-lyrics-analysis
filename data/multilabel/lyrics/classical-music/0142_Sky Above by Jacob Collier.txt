Sky above
What are you dreaming of?
Seems like you're all alone
Do you feel free?

[Verse 2]
I can see
More than is clear to me
So come one and open me
Let me feel free

[Interlude: Group, Jacob Collier]
So open up your care
And leave it everywhere
And every now and then (Every now and then)
You think of home again (Home again)
Home was always waiting for you

[Bridge]
I'ma gonna sing the song I long to sing
And sing it all the way
Gonna say yabadiyo
Gonna say yabadiyo
I'ma gonna blow the winds of change and sing
I'll never go astray
Gonna say yabadiyo
Gonna say yabadiyo
I'm gonna sing the song I long to sing
And sing it all the way
Gonna say yabadiyo
Gonna say yabadiyo
I'ma gonna blow the winds of change and sing
I'll never go astray
Gonna say yabadiyo
Gonna say yabadiyo
(One, two, three, four)

And the world goes round
And the world goes round (Badiyaâ€™s gonna take you home)
And the world goes round, and the sky fall down
And the world goes round
And the world goes round, and the sky fall down
And the world goes round, and the sky fall down
See the world goes round, see the sky fall down
(And the world goes round)

[Bridge]
Let the rain fall down, let the rain fall down
Let the rain fall down, it's gonna be okay
Let it all fall down, when it all falls down
Let it all fall down, it's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay

[Outro]
Don't know nothin' 'bout me
Box of stars in my world
