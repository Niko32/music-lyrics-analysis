“Naira... Oriel...Tarna...
Majestic winds of the northlands...
Protect our heroes from the deadly Naroth...
Cover their tracks with snow...
Rage on with all your fury...
Naira... Tarna... Oriel-Nirnaan…”

[Verse 1]
Dark is the way to the mountains of grey
Breath turns to ice in the air
The journey is painful and longer than life
Crossing the rocks in the night

[Chorus]
Gods lead them all
To Hargor's walls
Sacred power of raging winds
Keep away from the Black Order's steel
(Their black steel their black will)
Sacred power of raging winds
Please help them reach their goal
To hide in the snow
Sun and moon have left their brave sons

[Verse 2]
In the dangerous peaks
They may all find their death
Searching for the ancient realm
The worship of darkness is Nekron's desire
His soldiers the black
The Black Order sect!

Gods lead them all
To Hargor's walls
Sacred power of raging winds
Keep away from the Black Order's steel
(Their black steel their black will)
Sacred power of raging winds
Please help them reach their goal
To hide in the snow
Dargor's past appears before him
[Dargor:]
"Father
Are you really wanting my soul?
Your black blood
No longer flows in my veins."

[Vankar:]
"Son you are a betrayer
You have betrayed me!!"

[Dargor:]
"No! I don't want to serve
Your hellish will"

[Vankar:]
"You are half demon
Never forget that!"
(You are one of us!)
[Dargor:]
"I know it well for this I will pay!
But I will deny you and fight you forever!"

[Instrumental Break]

[Refrain]
Sacred power of raging winds
Fill their soul
And the Shadowlord's heart
In a magical vision Vankar appeared
In Dargor's dream
While the four heroes
Where trying to rest
He was born half demon half man
He struggled inside
But would soon understand
All would be pay with the
Blood on his hands

[Chorus]
Gods lead them all
To Hargor's walls
Sacred power of raging winds
Keep away from the Black Order's steel
(Their black steel their black will)
Sacred power of raging winds
Please help them reach their goal
To hide in the snow
Dargor's past appears before him
Vankar's thirst for bloody vengeance
Vankar lives for vengeance
