A new evolution will rise
One with better care and hope
Cell by cell nature will heal itself
Balance of the earth is restored
Ignorance became our deadliest sin
As we didn't hear the cry of our dying planet
These elements of selfishness led to our own destruction
Man must be undone
Three, two, one, launch
Human is gone, lost somewhere beyond the stars
