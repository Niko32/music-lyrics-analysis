September blue, thy sorrows be forgotten
October auburn, let this season pass
November gray, restore with thy rain
December white, thy beauty ever last

[Verse 1: 4EverfreeBrony]
Light of virtue shown
Sign of one's true form
To grow only small, giving guidance for all
Seen while hardly known

[Chorus: 4EverfreeBrony & Chi-Chi]
September blue, thy sorrows be forgotten
October auburn, let this season pass
November gray, restore with thy rain
December white, thy beauty ever last

[Verse 2: Chi-Chi]
Bright inviting morn
Brilliant rays reborn
So follow along as the shadows have gone
Walk where time has torn

[Chorus: 4EverfreeBrony & Chi-Chi]
September blue, thy sorrows be forgotten
October auburn, let this season pass
November gray, restore with thy rain
December white, thy beauty ever last

Ahhhh, ahhhh, ahhhh...
December white, thy beauty ever last
