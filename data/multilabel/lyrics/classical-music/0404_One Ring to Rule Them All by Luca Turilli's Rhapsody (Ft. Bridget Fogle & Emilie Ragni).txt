"We wants it, we needs it
We must have, the precious"

[Verse 1]
In the leaf of the oak, in the heart of the rock
In the shade of the icy Misty Mountains
In the vast lonely reigns of the whole Middle-Earth
Somber whispers unveil forgotten dangers
Then he came for them all, he was known as "The Grey"
The old keeper of wise and ancient magic
He, the one who could read in the soul of the ring
The dark will of the sinful necromancer

[Chorus]

[Verse 2]
His new sin was revealed and their journey began
Time to leave the green valleys of the Shire
All their lives left behind, plenty of courage to face
The real threat for the future of the known world
The Black Eye upon them while they met elves and men
Nine companions, one legendary fellowship
Over wild snowy peaks, through the mines' deadly maze
A new deed, a new fragment of their glorious fate

[Chorus]

Fear the One Ring
The One Ring to rule them all

[Spoken – Gollum]
"My precious"

[Bridge – Bridget Figle & Alessandro Conti]
River, gently grant a vision
While you cross the wide woods with you tearful eyes
Show them what their mind is keeping
What the heart is hiding, all the truth behind
River, gently grant a vision
While you cross the wide woods with you tearful eyes
Show them what their mind is keeping
What the heart is hiding, all the truth behind

[Instrumental Break with a Choir Sung]

Fear it, the One Ring to rule them all!
