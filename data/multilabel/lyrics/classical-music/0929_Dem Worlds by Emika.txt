Dem worlds speak into me
Dem worlds simply resonate
Well I know now what I must do
Well I know now what I must leave

[Verse 2]
Dem worlds speak into me
Dem worlds simply run through me
Well I know now what I must do
Well I know now what I must leave

[Verse 3]
Dem worlds speak into me
Dem worlds simply run through me
And now
I feel you nowYou might also like
