Wilt thou unkind thus reave me
Of my heart, of my heart
And so leave me, and so leave me?

[Chorus 2]
Farewell, farewell!
But yet or ever I part, Oh cruel
Kiss me, sweet, kiss me
Sweet, sweet my jewel

[Verse 1]
Hope by disdain grows cheerless
Fear doth love, love doth fear
Beauty peerless, beauty peerless

[Chorus 2]
Farewell, farewell!
But yet or ever I part, Oh cruel
Kiss me, sweet, kiss me
Sweet, sweet my jewel

[Verse 2]
If no delays can move thee
Life shall die, death shall live
Still to love thee, still to love thee?
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Farewell, farewell!
But yet or ever I part, Oh cruel
Kiss me, sweet, kiss me
Sweet, sweet my jewel

[Verse 3]
Yet be thou mindful ever
Heat from fire, fire from heat
None can see sever, none can sever

[Chorus 2]
Farewell, farewell!
But yet or ever I part, Oh cruel
Kiss me, sweet, kiss me
Sweet, sweet my jewel

[Verse 4]
True love cannot be changed
Though delight from desert
Be estranged, be estranged

[Chorus 2][x2]
Farewell, farewell!
But yet or ever I part, Oh cruel
Kiss me, sweet, kiss me
Sweet, sweet my jewel
