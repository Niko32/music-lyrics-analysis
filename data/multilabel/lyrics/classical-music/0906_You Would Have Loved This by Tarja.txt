A soft and gentle coverlet of white
Unfolded in the shadows of the dawn
It sparkled in the early morning light

You would have loved this
You would have loved this
This was your favorite time of day

The greenery is laid across the mantle
And ornaments are hanging on the tree
And cradled in the windowsill's a candle
A beacon in the night to call you back to me

You would have loved this
You always loved this
I know you loved this time of year

And though I understand
One day again I'll see you
I long to touch your hand
Hear your voice, feel you

You would have loved this
You always loved this
Oh, how you lovedYou might also like
