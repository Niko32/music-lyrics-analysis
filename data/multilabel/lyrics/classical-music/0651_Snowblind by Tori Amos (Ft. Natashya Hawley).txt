Some get snow blind
With the daylight
But then with the night
For once see clearly

[Verse 2: Natashya Hawley & Tori Amos]
Through fox's eyes
I've been watching you
How do you free your mind
So that you're not confined
By our concept
Of what we call time?

[Chorus 1: Natashya Hawley, Natashya Hawley & Tori Amos]
Follow me, call me
Anabelle

[Verse 3: Tori Amos]
Some get SnowBlind
With the daylight
But then with the night
For once see clearly

[Chorus 2: Tori Amos]
I will follow you, Anabelle
You might also like[Verse 4: Natashya Hawley & Tori Amos]
Just imagine Him, there upon that hill
Over 3,000 years from now 'til then
A key fragment of you and him

[Outro: Natashya Hawley & Tori Amos]
And one I must now bring back
I'm wondering...
Were you giants or friends?
Even the Morrigan?
Lovers or enemies?
One or all of these?
