Just to show the world that you exist
So you try
You hope they'll see
If on this brand new day you'll look
On the bright side of the same old street
You will see
What you deserve

Jay：
Let’s Go∼
我說幾華里 我送別了過去
他們說人生的結局 非常的戲劇
塞外羌笛 孤城馬蹄
在武俠的世界裡 誰與誰來為敵

合：
Lalalalalalalalala∼
黃沙裡 用竹筆 寫下的字 叫勇氣

Jay：
You just have to try
To be who you are
And you ought to fly
Step into the light
You might also like小派：
And soon you will find（Be yourself）
Somewhere deep inside
There's a universe right there waiting to be unlocked
The key lies in looking into yourself

Jay：
Oh∼Try try try try
Just do what is right
You’ll fly so high
Let go of the brakes
Be who you are
Be yourself ‘cause your power is on

合：
When you believe in what you’ve got
You know you’re perfect just be who you are

小派：
So they don't see what you're made of
But I like you and I know they're wrong
Now it's time
To show them what you got
Let the blue skies cheer you on
Embrace the wind we'll ride along
You're perfect when you’re who you are
Jay：
這世界 有些事 有些人 憑感覺
別管他旌旗密佈遍野 狼煙霜雪
那故事在穿越 而我也在翻頁
一行行做好準備 敏銳而直接

合：
Lalalalalalalalala∼
愛不滅 真實的一切 廢話全收回

小派：
You just have to try
To be who you are

Jay：
And you ought to fly

Somewhere deep inside
There's a universe right there waiting to be unlocked
The key lies in looking into yourself

Jay：
Oh∼Try try try try
Just do what is right
You’ll fly so high
Let go of the brakes
