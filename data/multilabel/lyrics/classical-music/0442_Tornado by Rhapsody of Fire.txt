Oooooooooh
Dominus folia probitas lucem pro vita
Dominus folia probitas lucem pro vita vias

[Verse 1]
In primordial times of war
Gods and men, dragonlords
Fighting for a dead world
A black sun will scare us all
Gloomy past carved in hate
Ready to be back
It's my time, my chance to show
Who you are, who we are
Shade of human terror
May I cause the unborn's fall
Through new gates he will come
For the end of all

[Pre-Chorus]
From empty shadows
Electric silence
In veiled reflections
Of one lonely sunshine
In the air my whispered name
In the air...
In the air...
You might also like[Verse 2]
Now condemned to be insane
Evil born, you will drown
Swallowed by oblivion
Once to darkness I belonged
Deep inside, you're the same
Godforsaken soul
In my heart the angels' fate
In your name fear and pain
Violence and bloodshed
May the thunder's holy force
Pound in me, burn my sin
Storm once more

[Pre-Chorus]
From empty shadows
Electric silence
In veiled reflections
Of one lonely sunshine
In the air my whispered name

[Chorus]
Beyond the secrets of space colliding
In stellar fire I will burn to save
My world's unwritten fate
From quakes and volcanos
Beyond the secrets of space colliding
In stellar fire I will rise again
As tear of angels' pain
As cyclone, tornado again
[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
From empty shadows
Electric silence
In veiled reflections
Of one lonely sunshine
In the air my whispered name

[Chorus]
Beyond the secrets of space colliding
In stellar fire I will burn to save
My world's unwritten fate
From quakes and volcanos
Beyond the secrets of space colliding (Space colliding)
In stellar fire I will rise again (Rise again)
As tear of angels' pain
As cyclone (cyclone!), tornado (tornado!) again

[Outro]
Oooooooooh
Dominus folia probitas lucem pro vita
Dominus folia probitas lucem pro vita
Folia probitas lucem pro vita
Folia probitas lucem pro vita in vita lux
