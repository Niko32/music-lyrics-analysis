[Verse 1]
The aim of the serpent, the serpent's creation
Reveals itself now trough crystal spheres
He's riding the waves as a real conqueror
Colliding with ships, the ships of the kings
He owns, your sword!
The emerald weapon, the steel of the heroes
Flow the black tears of dark angels
Your blade is now serving the dark (force...)
The evil source of the unborn
The truth is there, in this hands

[Pre-Chorus]
Quando corpus morie-etur fac ut animae donetur
Starless is my night (Starless is my night)
Silent is my ride (Silent is my ride)
Trough the paradox of wisdom...
To the sea of (souls) (The sea of souls)
Nel silenzio tragiche realtà...

[Chorus]
Fire is blazing fast across the bloody red sea
The sunlight is fading on him
These are the wizard's last holy sights...
The wizard's last rhymes

We are reaching the brutal, the tragic dimension
Led by reflections, reflections of death
The ghost in the fog, wander lamenting
While violence devours my wasted brain
Let me... awake!
The astral bewitchement is the fatal witness
Of created surge of chaos
I reflect the constellations' (fall)
Now close your eyes and fight blind
The moon is dying, don't fear his might

[Pre-Chorus]
Quando corpus morie-etur fac ut animae donetur
Starless is my night (Starless is my night)
Silent is my ride (Silent is my ride)
Trough the paradox of wisdom...
To the sea of (souls) (The sea of souls)
Nel silenzio tragiche realtà...

[Chorus]
Fire is blazing fast across the bloody red sea
The sunlight is fading on him
These are the wizard's last holy sights...
The poem's tragic rhymes
[Instrumental Break]

[Post-Chorus]
Fierce blows the wind, infinite fires
On Elnor sea, hail to the king!
He died as brave, oh valiant hero
But so in vain, facing the storm, the storm!

[Spoken - Aresius]
"And soon the snakes of the abyss
Swallowed the mighty woodship
While the waves of the bloody ocean
Were reaching the walls of the falling town..."

[Bridge]
My brother's limbs, food for those snakes
The divine steel, deep under me
Under me!

[Pre-Chorus]
Quando corpus morie-etur fac ut animae donetur
Starless is my night (Starless is my night)
Silent is my ride (Silent is my ride)
Trough the paradox of wisdom...
To the sea of (souls) (The sea of souls)
Nel silenzio tragiche realtà...
[Chorus]
Fire is blazing fast across the bloody red sea
The sunlight is fading on him
These are the wizard's last holy sights...

Fire is blazing fast across the bloody red sea
