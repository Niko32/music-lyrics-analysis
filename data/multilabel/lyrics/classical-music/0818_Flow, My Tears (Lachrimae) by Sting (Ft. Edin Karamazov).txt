Flow my tears fall from your springs
Exiled forever, Let me mourn
Where nights black bird hir sad infamy sings
There, let me live forlorn
Down, vain lights shine you no more
No, nights are dark enough for those
That in despair their last fortunes deplore
Light doth but shame disclose
Never may my woes be relieved
Since pity is fled
And tears, and sighs, and groans
My weary days, my weary days of all joys have deprived
From the highest spire of contentment
My fortune is thrown
And fear, and grief, and pain
For my deserts, for my deserts are my hopes since hope is gone

[Chorus][x2]
Hark you shadows that in darkness dwell
Learn to contemn light
Happy, happy they that in hell
Feel not the world's despiteYou might also like
