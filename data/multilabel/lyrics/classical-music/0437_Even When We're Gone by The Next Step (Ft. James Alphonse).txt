[Verse 1]
Stay
Just for a while
Just 'cause we're here
Just for this one last moment
Hey
We could be wild
We could be free
Just for this one last moment

[Chorus]
I don't care
About the typical
I'm not scared to dream
We got more
Than we bargained for
We made memories
'Cause love is
More than a miracle
It's endless energy
'Cause love
Makes us invincible
Even when
Even when you're gone
You might also like[Bridge]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

[Outro]
Even when youâ€™re gone
