Silly boy don't talk to me
I don't have the energy
Please don't ask to
Dance with me tonight

[Verse 2]
I do better on my own
I don't mean to come off cold
But my dear I'm all danced out tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the gin is hitting me
And it's almost half past three
Am I crazy or seeing things
I'm sorry if I can't go for another swing

[Chorus]
You're a charmer that's for sure
But I can't stand anymore
Shame I would've danced with you tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the gin is hitting me
And it's almost half past three
Am I crazy or seeing things
I'm sorry if I can't go for another swing
You might also like[Chorus]
You're a charmer that's for sure
But I can't stand anymore
Shame I would've danced with you tonight
Would've danced with you tonight
