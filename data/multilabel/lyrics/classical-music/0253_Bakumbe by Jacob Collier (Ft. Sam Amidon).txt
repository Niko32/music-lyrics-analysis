Oh, Bakumbe, whatcha know?
Up the mountain down below
I can feel the wind begin to blow
Open up that old window
Open up and let him go

[Verse 2]
Round and round the world we go
Oh, Bakumbe Djesse, come back home
Singin' now's the time to let him go
Open up that old window
Open up and let him go

[Refrain]
Let him go, na na
Let him go, na na, oh

[Verse 3]
Oh, Bakumbe, whatcha know?
Up the mountain down below
I can feel the wind begin to blow
Open up that old window (Open up that window)
Open up and let him go

[Verse 4]
Round and round the world we go (Round we go)
Oh, Bakumbe Djesse, come back home
(Wanna come sing)
Now's the time to let him go (Let him go)
Open up that old window
Open up and let him go
