A waltz when she walks in the room
She pulls back the hair from her face
She turns to the window
To sway in the moonlight
Even her shadow has grace

[Verse 2]
A waltz for the girl out of reach
She lifts her hands up to the sky
She moves with the music
The song is her lover
The melody's making her cry

[Chorus]
So she dances in and out of the crowd like a glance
This romance is from afar calling me silently

[Verse 3]
A waltz for the chance I should take
But how will I know where to start?
She's spinning between constellations and dreams
Her rhythm is my beating heart

[Chorus]
So she dances in and out of the crowd like a glance
This romance is from afar calling me silently
I can't keep on watching forever
I give up this view just to tell her
You might also like[Bridge]
When I close my eyes, I can see
The spotlights are bright on you and me
We've got the floor
And you're in my arms
How could I ask for more?

[Chorus]
So she dances in and out of the crowd like a glance
This romance is from afar calling me silently
I can't keep on watching forever
And I'm givin' up this view just to tell her

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
