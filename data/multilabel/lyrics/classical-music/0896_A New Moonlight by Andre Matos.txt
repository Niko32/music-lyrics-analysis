[Verse 1]
Lifestorm broke my anchors
And like a wreck I've been
Sea and sky were just one darkness
Such a brilliant radiance
You came!

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm alive, I'm alive
Just by the light from your eyes!

[Verse 2]
Lifestorm freed my anchors
And many shores I've seen
Sea and sky they gave me shelter
Now we only meet in dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm alive, I'm alive
Just by the lightfrom your eyes!

[Chorus]
And I need you to be
Like the haven that I seek
But clouds showed me and I saw:
"You were just the moonlight
And the moon belongs
To no one"

Aa-aa-aa-aa-aah
No one
Aa-aa-aa-aa-aah
No one
Aa-aa-aa-aa-aah
No one!
Aa-aa-aa-aa-aah

[Bridge]
Suddenly, I stare and see
The light in you shines on me
Pouring down, endlessly
Endlessly, endlessly

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
But clouds showed me and I saw:
"You were just the moonlight
And the moon belongs
To no one"
