I'm drifting through the night
As fallen star divides the sky of divinity

Taken on a journey
And enlightened to the past
And if I wake, if I wake, will it embrace me?

Awoke at dawn to calm the storm inside of me
Take my last breath as I fall into eternity...

Risen to an astral flight, I wander through
The serene with you
Answers to the voices I hear
In a Winter's Dream, a dream

Empty minds still wait, I'm here
Captured by light - my spirit rides through the
Night
And if I dream to wake - will it embrace me?

When the story fades and all is said done
I can not wait - pray for daybreak -
Will it escape me?

Awoke at dawn to calm the storm inside of me
Take my last breath as I fall into eternity...
