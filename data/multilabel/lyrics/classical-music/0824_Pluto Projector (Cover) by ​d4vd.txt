Four years ago, I was captivated by your smile
But I wouldn't call it love yet, no
Cause it wasn't love, it was infatuation
And I wasn't old enough to understand
Old enough to understand, understand
Understand, understand, understand
Old enough to understand
Woah, to understand, to understand
To understand (to understand, to understand, to understand, to understand)
Old enough to understand (to understand, to understand, to understand, to understand)
Woah, woah

[Outro]
I think we're old enough to understand
We didn't know what love was back then
Too young to realize what we had
But I won't make the same mistake againYou might also like
