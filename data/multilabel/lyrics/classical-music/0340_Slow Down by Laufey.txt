Slow down
Give me just a moment
I'm so grown now in my own apartment
Cooking my own dinner spaghetti for one
Though I'm gettin' older my life has just begun

[Verse 2]
I wish it would slow down even for a second
I'm so old now left my adolescence
Going out to parties and getting way too drunk
Think I found somebody but don't think that it's love

[Chorus]
I wish it would slow down
Slow down

[Verse 3]
Someday I won't be in my twenties
In a new state maybe even married
I'll have my own children
They're tired of being young
They'll ask me about their futures
I'll t–µll my little ones

[Chorus]
Baby, slow down
Slow down
