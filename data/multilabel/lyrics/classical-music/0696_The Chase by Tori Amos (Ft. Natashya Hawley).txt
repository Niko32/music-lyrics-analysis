Out there are hunters
Let's say predators
I have weapons
That could destroy them
You must out create
It's the only way
I am the hunter and the hunted
Joined together
You create duality
And neutrality
I must leave you
With the fire muse
Show her the riddle
It is serious if you lose
Out there
I'll be the hare
Then I'm the greyhound
Chasing after you
Then I'll change my frequency
To a fish that thinks
Then you will find yourself
In the paws of the otter
Near her jaws
Then I'll grow my wings
As a flying thing
Flying thing
You be warned
I'm the falcon
Watch me change
To a grain of corn
A grain of corn?
Hear the alarm
In your head?
I'm the hen
Black and red
And you're in my barn
They would have won
Use your head or you'll be deadYou might also like
