[Verse 1]
Here be friends...
Here be heroes...
Here be sunshine...
Here be grey...
Here be life...
Here love lies bleeding...
Memories so hazy...
And dreams that drove me crazy

[Verse 2]
Here be down...
Here be paradise...
Here be starbright...
Here be pain...
Here be smiles in eyes like rainbows...
My father and my mother...
My sisters and my brother -
Pictured within

[Verse 3]
Where there're shadows ill met by moonlight...
There are dragons I have slain...
And here be bright eyes with hair so golden...
Sunrise and sunset and running free...
And laughing at the rain
You might also like[Verse 4]
Here be home...
Here be travellin'...
Here be thunder...
Here be blue...
And Sometimes heaven and thoughts of wonder...
The Miracle of children...
A poet and a pilgrim

[Outro]
Kith and kin - pictured within
Lose and win - pictured within
