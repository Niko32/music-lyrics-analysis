Feel them arresting me, unknowables
Fading at dawn, troubles too

Dimness sustains, oh, the regret
I could be lost to you, lost in thought
Sending a kiss back to the sky

So has my world become run out of breath
I'm not the only one to lose a friend
Where do you go? You're going home

What do I do with the void in your shape
Leaving me frailty, a drop and I break
What do I do with half of myself?

And then when the stars align with some kind of peace
I could be loved by you, either way
Where did you go? You’re going home
And then when the stars align with some kind of peace
I know I'm loved by you, either way
Where did you go? You’re going home
And then when the stars align with some kind of peace
I know I'm loved by you, either way
Where did you go? You’re going home
You’re going homeYou might also like
