Ancient lands, lost in time
Smokes of sands and walls alive
Surround this mask of death I wear
Awakened by intruder souls
The jackal screams as my stone gods behold
Desecrators of Ra

[Chorus]
Pharaoh's curse upon you
Who dares to invade his sacred ground
Gods of the Nile arise to strike you down

[Verse 2]
Forgotten days of my rule
Cities blazed with gold and jewel
Diamond symbol of riches beyond compare
Now I lay cold in this chamber of stone
Fools forsaken the wrath of my throne
Desecrators of Ra

[Chorus]

[Break]
Mystic gods of the stars
I summon thee from afar
Sun, moon and earth
Align for my rebirth
You might also likeI feel the blood flow through my veins
The life force shines on me again
Let the ritual begin
You will pay for your sins

I am god, I am king of the land
The hour of judgement is at hand
Winds of revenges sweep through the sand
The mighty pharaoh lives again

[Solo]

[Chorus]
