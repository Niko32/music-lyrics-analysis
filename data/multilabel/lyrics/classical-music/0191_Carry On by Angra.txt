Simple minded brain, for now, you succumb
Nothing changes your way
This world insists to be the same
Based on our mistakes
The flowers fade along the road
Don't blindfold your eyes
So loneliness becomes the law
Of a senseless life

[Pre-Chorus]
Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride
To get there, go

[Verse 2]
Now you have to face another day
You won't be alone
This life is forcing us to stay
"For how long?"
Cold is the wind and thunderstruck
On a stormy night
But can't you see, I'm by your side
We are marching on
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride
To get there

[Chorus]
So, carry on, there's a meaning to life (Carry on)
Which someday we may find
Carry on, it's time to forget (Carry on)
The remains from the past, to carry on

[Guitar Solo]

[Pre-Chorus]
Follow your steps and you will find
The unknown ways are on your mind
Need nothing else than just your pride
To get there

[Chorus]
So, carry on, there's a meaning to life (Carry on)
Which someday we may find
Carry on, it's time to forget (Carry on)
The remains from the past
So, carry on, there's a meaning to life (Carry on)
Which someday we may find
Carry on, it's time to forget (Carry on)
The remains from the past
[Outro]
Carry on, it's time to forget
The remains from the past, to carry on
Remains from the past, to carry on
Remains from the past
