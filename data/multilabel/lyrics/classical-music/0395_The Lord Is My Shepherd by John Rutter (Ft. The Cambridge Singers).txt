Therefore can I lack nothing

He shall feed me in a green pasture:

And lead me forth beside the waters of comfort

He shall convert my soul:

And bring me forth in the paths of righteousness

For his Name's sake

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death

I will fear no evil:

For thou art with me;

Thy rod and thy staff comfort me

Thou shalt prepare a table before me against them

That trouble me:
You might also likeThou hast anointed my head with oil

And my cup shall be full

But thy loving-kindness and mercy shall follow me

All the days of my life:

And I will dwell in the house of the

Lord for ever
