Double dip, overdrive
Tunnel vision, don't look back
Everything is turning black
I've been watching things unfold
Seems impossible, I know
Double vision, out of whack
Everything is turning black
Is turning black

Though it hurts me to compare
You can always find me here
Upward battle from the start
Put together, pull apart
When I wake up I can see
Something linger over me
Cold air rushes down my spine
There is nowhere else to hide
No, not this timeYou might also like
