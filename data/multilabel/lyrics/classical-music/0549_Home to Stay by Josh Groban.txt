I know you're gone, I watched you leave
I always thought that it was me
You made it clear with that last kiss
You couldn't live a life with maybe's and what if's

[Chorus]
When every boat has sailed away
And every path is marked and paved
When every road has had its say
Then I'll be bringing you back home to stay

[Verse 2]
I have the cards you sent to me
You wrote of trains and Paris galleries
This spring you'll draw
Canals, and frescoed walls
Look how far your dreaming's gone

[Chorus]
When every town looks just the same
When every choice gets hard to make
When every map is put away
Then I'll be bringing you back home to stay

[Bridge]
And now I know
Why you had to go alone
Isn't there a place between
You might also like[Chorus]
When every boat has sailed away
And every path is marked and paved
When every road has had its say
Then I'll be bringing you back home to stay

[Outro]
Reach out to me, call out my name
And I would bring you back again today
