Either tell me or Ill tell you
Come on, come on
I know you know what I know; it's in your eyes
I'll have to tell you, I can't wait
It's L-O-V-E, it's love
And I’m in love; I’m so happy
It's L-O-V-E, it's love
I'm incoherent my dear
Oh happy happiness
In love
In love
In love
Oh happy happiness, happiness
