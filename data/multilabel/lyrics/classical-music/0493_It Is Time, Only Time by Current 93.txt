You heard the winds cry
And then you told me
You felt the seas die
And then you showed me
The flight of seagulls
And whispered gently
The party's over
Then
Then I knew it was time

You looked so tired then
Bereft of beauty
I knew that long ago
Your heart had stopped
But all this beauty
But all these shadows
As if to say yes
To life was pointless
And then
Then I knew it was time

In a small park
Just down from Soho
You gestured wildly
But meaning nothing
And all the fountains
Shouted surrender
And all the trees bowed
At my betrayal
And then
Then I knew it was time
You might also likeNo words have substance
No words are better
Than when I held you
Ragdoll defeated
So drained of bright light
So full of hatred
With your soul crumbling
Bartered for flowers
I should
Have told you
It's just time

And then we looked up
Urbi et orbi
I saw the stars merge
Over St. Patrick's
You said I am finished
I am mist and foglight
And slipped so sweetly
Into your grace
If only
If only it was only time

And now it's eight years
Since I last saw you
And all the starlight
Is now as nothing
The letters all burned
The kisses complete
And all the coupling
Long forgotten
And you long dead
Damned or forgiven
It was no dream
