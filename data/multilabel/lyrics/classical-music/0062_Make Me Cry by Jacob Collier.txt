In every sea there’s a mouth of a river
Where waterfall riches flow down
Why do they cry?
No one knows why
In every mouth there’s a word of forgiveness
That melts all the ice to the ground
Why do you sigh?
I don’t know why

[Chorus]
Why does the sky fall down
Like pouring rain?
To let it flow again
Gonna make you feel alright
Take your dreams, keep them out of sight
Wanna make you come alive
Close your eyes, keep you warm at night
So come a little closer to me
So many things I want you to see
My darling

[Verse 3]
In every laugh is the sorrow
Of all of the tears that you’ve held for so long
Would you make me cry?
Oh, let me run dry
In every tear are the eyes of a father
And mother that brought you to see
Sing lullaby
As you say goodnight, night, night (goodnight)
You might also like[Chorus]
Why do the stars look down (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 and 10)
And feel no shame (Counting up the droplets of the tears falling from the sky)
When they are all the same?
Gonna set your mind alight
Keep you close to me and hold you tight
Wanna keep you burning bright
Take your words, shine them like a light
So come a little closer to me (Come a little closer)
So many things I want you to see (Many things I want you to see)
My darling

[Outro]
In every soul is the need to grow older
To speed up the passing of time
I don’t know why
But it makes me cry
