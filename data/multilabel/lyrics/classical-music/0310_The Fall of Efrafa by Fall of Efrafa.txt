Blood spills on toiled ground
Fur will hang in ragged clumps
Upon the hedgerows
Upon the hedgerows

Peace is lost to us now
A fettered ideal
Faith is lost to us now

They all are our warmongers
And will make our laws
A paw will fall upon the weak
But, mark the day
They will mark the day

In death, we make our charge
Our last lament
In death, we make our charge
Our last lament

Peace is lost to us now
A fettered ideal
Faith is lost to us now

The fields, the fields are covered with blood!
The fields, the fields are covered with blood..."
