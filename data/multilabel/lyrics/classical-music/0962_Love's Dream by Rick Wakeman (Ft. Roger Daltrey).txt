As long as love is young
As long as love is young

Oh love, oh love
As long as life shall last
As long as life shall last

The hour will come when we shall weep
On thoughts of love and pleasures past
The hour will come when we shall weep
On pleasures past

Oh love, in love
Our innocence is sharing
As long as love is true

In love, in love
Our innocence will last
Our innocence will last

As sure my heart in sacred hours
Providing you my secret quest

Oh love, sweet love
As long as love is young
As long as life shall last

As long as love is young
As long as life shall last

As long as love is young
