No tree can grow to Heaven
Till its roots reach down to Hell
Will we ever learn our lesson?
We all fall in parallel

[Verse]
No tree can grow to Heaven
Till its roots reach down to Hell
Will we ever learn our lesson?
We all fall in parallel
Don't bury the confession
There's a light behind the shell
Do you dream of Armageddon
Just to get yourself to Heaven?
We all fall in parallel (Parallel)
