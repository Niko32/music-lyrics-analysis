A kiss in the cold
As warm as home
With a one ton heart
A tear in the snow
I'm heading home

With a one ton heart
Dive away, a million years and a day
A one ton heart
Never breaks all the way

The saddest truth you'll ever come to understand
The end might wait right where it all began

With a one ton heart, oh-oh, oh
With a one ton heart, oh-oh, oh-oh
A one ton heart, oh-oh, oh
With a one ton heart, oh-oh, oh-oh
With a one ton heart
Dive away
With a one ton heart
A million years and a day
A one ton heart
Never breaks
When it falls
All the way
My one ton heart
You might also likeWith your hand on my face
A winterly touch
You whisper my name
For an eternal embrace
Time won't stop
But time will tell

With a one ton heart
Dive away, a million years and a day
A one ton heart
Never breaks when it falls all the way

With a one ton heart, oh-oh, oh
With a one ton heart, oh-oh, oh-oh
A one ton heart, oh-oh, oh
With a one ton heart, oh-oh, oh-oh
With a one ton heart
Dive away
With a one ton heart
A million years and a day
A one ton heart
Never breaks
When it falls
All the way

The saddest truth you'll ever come to understand
The end might wait right where it all began
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

I can't breathe
I can't cry
I can't sleep at night

With a one ton heart, oh-oh, oh
With a one ton heart, oh-oh, oh-oh
A one ton heart, oh-oh, oh
With a one ton heart, oh-oh, oh-oh
With a one ton heart
Dive away
With a one ton heart
A million years and a day
A one ton heart
Never breaks
When it falls
All the way
My one ton heart
