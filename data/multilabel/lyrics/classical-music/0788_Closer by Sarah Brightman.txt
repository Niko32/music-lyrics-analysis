Ready for love and I know I'm coming home to the stars
My heart is in fly
My dreams are alive, I can feel

I know that there's something inside
I'm falling into the sky
It's taking me over now
I'm getting closer now

Know I'm feeling for so long
Feels like gliding away
Now like the sun
I demand just rainy days

I'm ready for love for the first time
Ready for love and I know I'm coming home to the stars
My heart is in fly
My dreams are alive, I can feel

I know that there's something inside
I'm falling into the sky
It's taking me over now
I'm getting closer now

Oh I can feel it again
It's taking me over now
You might also likeI'm ready for love
I'm ready for love for the first time
Take me away
Take me away to the sun

I'm ready for love for the first time
Ready for love and I know I'm coming home to the stars
My heart is in fly
My dreams are alive, I can feel

I know that there's something inside
I'm falling into the sky
It's taking me over now
I'm getting closer now
