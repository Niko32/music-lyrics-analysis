To see the house I lived in
To see the streets I walked on
And there's the children
When they were oh so small
Step back with me

If I can only turn the clock back
Back to the days when we were oh so young
To relive those days gone by
When love was new, we touched the sky

And there's my father
He's waving to me gently
Oh, how I miss him
To touch the face of friends and loved ones
To hear the laughter and to feel the tears
What a miracle this would be
If only we can turn the hands of time

And there's my father
He's waving to me gently
Oh, how I miss him
To touch the face of friends and loved ones
To hear the laughter and to feel the tears
What a miracle this would be
If only we can turn the hands of time

Turning back the hands of time
