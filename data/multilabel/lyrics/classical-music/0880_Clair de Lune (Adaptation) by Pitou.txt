Now don't go grieving, little one
There are some things that need to be, need to be done
Go rest your head
And in your dreams
I'll come along

I'm leaving, little one
Don't go grieving, little one
There's power found in a song, hear me

When I'm done I will go back to you
I will find some place and light to take back to you
I've been awaiting for a long time now
Ever waiting but it's time now
I've been awaiting, but when I go please
Stay, stay, wait

I'm leaving, littlе one
Don't go grieving, little onе
For this power found in a song, hear meYou might also like
