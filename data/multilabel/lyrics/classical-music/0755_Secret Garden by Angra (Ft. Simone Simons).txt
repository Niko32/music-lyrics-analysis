A moonlit sky
The pale light unveils the secret path
Gates covered in roses
Hide a silent place
I hear you breathe
Sighs in the wind are leading me
Into paradise
I come for you
I will forever return

[Chorus – Simone Simons]
Angels will call our names
They take us into the garden of dreams
And when your eyes meet mine
The light you shine will never die

[Verse 2 – Simone Simons]
Sing with me
The lullaby that sets me free
All my fears fading
Your sweet embrace
Talk to me
Make all my sorrows disappear
In my black hours
I come to you
I will forever return
You might also like[Chorus – Simone Simons]
Angels will call our names
They take us into the garden of dreams
And when your eyes meet mine
The light you shine will never die
Angels will call our names
They take us into the garden of dreams
And when your eyes meet mine
The love we share will never die

[Orchestral Section]

[Refrain – Simone Simons]
Come, meet me tonight
Come to our secret garden
Hide with me, hide in your arms
Hold me forever
Come, meet me tonight
Come to our secret garden
Hide with me, hide by your side
Hold me forever
Here in your arms

[Chorus – Simone Simons]
Angels will call our names
They take us into the garden of dreams
And when your eyes meet mine
The light that shines will never die
Angels will call our names
They take us into the garden of dreams
And when your eyes meet mine
The light that shines will never die
The light you shine will never die
