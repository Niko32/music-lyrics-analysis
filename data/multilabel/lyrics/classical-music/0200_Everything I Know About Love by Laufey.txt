So enchanting in every way
It's everlasting every day
Sweet obsession, rose bouquets
Oh, it's Heaven or so they say

[Pre-Chorus]
I wouldn't mind
I heard that falling fast is so divine
Are these songs just telling plain old lies?

[Chorus]
'Cause that's everything I know about love
Everything I know about love
I don't know that much at all
I trip, I fall every time I try
It's all too much
That's everything I know about love

[Verse 2]
Captivating angel eyes
Stomach sick with butterflies
When will someone prove to me
That this isn't fantasy?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Causе I wouldn't mind
I heard that falling fast is so divine
Are thеse songs just telling plain old lies?

'Cause that's everything I know about love
(Everything I know)
That's everything I know about love
(Everything I know)
Oh, I don't know that much at all
I trip, I fall every time I try
It's all too much
That's everything I know about love
(Everything I know)
(Everything I know)
Oh, I don't know that much at all
I trip, I fall every time I try
It's all too much
That's everything I know about love
