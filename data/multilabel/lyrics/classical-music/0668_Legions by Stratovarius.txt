Far in the core of the earth
First it was given birth
We heard the call, the message was so clear
The tracks were laid for the future to come

[Verse 2]
Sons and daughters of the Rising sun
The armies in Europe, here we come
We run like the wind, we play from the heart
Now we are here, together we sing

[Chorus]
Faster than light, higher than the sky
Tonight we're together again
We never give up and never give in
Stronger than steel, we're the Legions of the Twilight

[Verse 3]
We survived the hard times
Never accepted the lies
You run like the wind, you sing from the heart
Now that we're here together we'll sing

[Chorus]
Faster than light, higher than the sky
Tonight we're together again
We never give up and never give in
Stronger than steel, we're the Legions of the Twilight

When we have to go back home again
We'll keep the memories we gained inside our hearts

[Chorus]
Faster than light, higher than the sky
Tonight we're together again
We never give up and never give in
Stronger than steel, we're the Legions of the Twilight

[Chorus]
Faster than light, higher than the sky
Tonight we're together again
We never give up and never give in
Stronger than steel, we're the Legions of the Twilight

[Outro]
Legions of the Twilight
Legions of the Twilight
Raise your hands for us!
