I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV
I want my, I want my MTV

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 1]
Now look at them yo-yos, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't working, that's the way you do it
Money for nothing and your chicks for free
Now that ain't working, that's the way you do it
Lemme tell ya, them guys ain't dumb
Maybe get a blister on your little finger
Maybe get a blister on your thumb

[Chorus]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs

[Verse 2]
See the little faggot with the earring and the makeup?
Yeah buddy, that's his own hair
That little faggot got his own jet airplane
That little faggot, he's a millionaire
You might also like[Chorus]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs
Hoover mover, uh
[Chorus]
Got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
He's gotta move these refrigerators
Got to move these colour TVs
Looky here, look out

[Verse 3]
I should a learned to play the guitar
I should a learned to play them drums
Look at that mama, she got it sticking in the camera
Man, we could have some
And he's up there, what's that? Hawaiian noises?
He's banging on the bongos like a chimpanzee
Oh, that ain't working, that's the way you do it
Get your money for nothing, get your chicks for free

[Chorus]
We got to install microwave ovens
Custom kitchen deliveries
We got to move these refrigerators
We got to move these colour TVs
[Verse 4]
Listen here
Now that ain't working, that's the way you do it
You play the guitar on the MTV
That ain't working, that's the way you do it
Money for nothing, and your chicks for free

[Refrain]
Money for nothing, chicks for free
Get your money for nothing, chicks for free
