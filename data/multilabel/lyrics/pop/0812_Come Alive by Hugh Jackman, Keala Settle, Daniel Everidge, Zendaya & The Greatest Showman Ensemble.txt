You stumble through your days
Got your head hung low, your sky's a shade of gray
Like a zombie in a maze
You're asleep inside, but you can shake awake

[Pre-Chorus: Hugh Jackman]
'Cause you're just a dead man walkin'
Thinkin' that's your only option
But you can flip the switch and brighten up your darkest day
Sun is up and the color's blindin'
Take the world and redefine it
Leave behind your narrow mind, you'll never be the same

[Chorus: Hugh Jackman]
Come alive, come alive
Go and light your light, let it burn so bright
Reachin' up to the sky
And it's open wide, you're electrified
And the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open
And you know you can't go back again
To the world that you were livin' in
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open
So come alive
You might also like[Verse 2: Hugh Jackman]
I see it in your eyes
You believe that lie that you need to hide your face
Afraid to step outside
So you lock the door, but don't you stay that way

[Pre-Chorus: Keala Settle, Daniel Everidge, Ensemble, Hugh Jackman]
No more livin' in those shadows
You and me, we know how that goes
'Cause once you see it, oh, you'll never, never be the same
Little bit of lightnin' strikin'
Bottled up to keep on shinin'
You can prove there's more to you, you cannot be afraid

[Chorus: Ensemble]
To come alive, come alive
Go and light your light, let it burn so bright
Reachin' up to the sky
And it's open wide, you're electrified
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't go back again
To the world that we were livin' in
'Cause we're dreamin' with our eyes wide open
So come alive
[Bridge: Ensemble, Zendaya, Hugh Jackman]
Come one, come all, come in, come on
To anyone who's burstin' with a dream
Come one, come all, you hear the call
To anyone who's searchin' for a way to break free
(Break free, break free)

[Chorus: All]
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open
And we know we can't go back again
To the world that we were livin' in
'Cause we're dreamin' with our eyes wide open (Hey)
When the world becomes a fantasy
And you're more than you could ever be
'Cause you're dreamin' with your eyes wide open (Yeah, yeah, oh)
And we know we can't go back again
To the world that we were livin' in
'Cause we're dreamin' with our eyes wide open
'Cause we're dreamin' with our eyes wide open
So come alive (Come alive, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
