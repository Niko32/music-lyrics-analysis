(Internet Money, bitch)

[Verse 1]
Let's start off with Bryce Hall, yeah, he got some smelly balls
Bitch, I only know his name, 'cause Addison gave him fame
Now, moving on to sister, I think I'm bout to diss her
That ass is looking thicker but forehead getting bigger
Oh, Jeffree Star says nig—
Up next is this boy named Noah, Mr. thick neck bitch, uh
Ain't nobody know her
Now, I see why Dixie chose him, he hit different
'Cause he got a bigger Peter, ain't that right Griffin?
Nikita wanna be the same shade as Lupita (Oop)
Tony locked up for tryna bag a señorita
Shane Dawson got a cat, hold on, someone call PETA (PETA)
PETA (PETA), PETA (PETA), PETA, PETA, PETA, uh
This you? This you? This you, this you, this you? (You)
Tana gets canceled every five to seven business days (Uh)
She finds a way to fuck up every different way (Bitch)
She dated Jake, "She dated Jake?"

[Interlude]
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Can we change the beat?
This ain't a race but I still take first place
This ain't a race but I—
You might also like[Chorus]
This ain't a race, Tony Lopez caught a case (Bitch)
Nessa sharted all up on Josh's face (Face)
Pretty bitch, itty bitty, tiny waist (Mwah)
Don't want the smoke but Charli had that vape (Vape)

[Verse 2]
Thomas, I can tell your breath stank (Yuck)
Don't got the hype because when Charli left, y'all tanked (Mwah)
Hype house reeks (Ew), they smell like feet (Y'all stank)
I got that WAP and I make your ship sink (Boom)
Tati forty and complaining about some vitamins (Grow up)
You don't like James, so why the hell did you invite him in? (Bye)
Bryce and Josh tried to bully little Chase (Y'all weird)
Y'all makin' diss tracks, let me put you in your place
I thought a bitch with a wetzel-pretzel said sum' (Oops)
I thought a bitch who sold his life to Triller said sum' (Oops)
I thought a bitch who lost the baddest bitch said sum' (Sum')
E' and Gray unfollowed me so they got blocked (They're fake)
And after Sister Squad, their channel went and flopped (Sorry)
I'ma hit a lick on David Dobrik
Rob his shit, take his Tesla, then I floor it (It)

[Chorus]
This ain't a race, Tony Lopez caught a case (Bitch)
Nessa sharted all up on Josh's face (Face)
Pretty bitch, itty bitty, tiny waist (Mwah)
Don't want the smoke but Charli had that vape (Vape)
This ain't a race, Tony Lopez caught a case (Bitch)
Nessa sharted all up on Josh's face (Face)
Pretty bitch, itty bitty, tiny waist (Mwah)
Don't want the smoke but Charli had that vape (Vape)
