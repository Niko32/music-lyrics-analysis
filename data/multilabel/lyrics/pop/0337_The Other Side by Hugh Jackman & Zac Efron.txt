Right here, right now, I put the offer out
I don't wanna chase you down but I know you see it
You run with me and I can cut you free
Out of the drudgery and walls you keep in
So trade that typical for somethin' colorful
And if it's crazy, live a little crazy
You can play it sensible, a king of conventional
Or you can risk it all and see

[Chorus: Hugh Jackman]
Don't you wanna get away
From the same old part you gotta play
'Cause I got what you need so come with me and take the ride
It'll take you to the other side
'Cause you can do like you do or you can do like me
Stay in the cage or you'll finally take the key
Oh, damn, suddenly you're free to fly
It'll take you to the other side

[Verse 2: Zac Efron]
Okay, my friend, you want to cut me in
Well, I hate to tell you but it just won't happen
So thanks, but no, I think I'm good to go
'Cause I quite enjoy the life you say I'm trapped in
Now I admire you and that whole show you do
You're onto somethin', really, it's somethin'
But I live among the swells and we don't pick up peanut shells
I'll have to leave that up to you
You might also like[Chorus: Zac Efron]
Don't you know that I'm okay
With this uptown part I get to play
'Cause I got what I need and I don't wanna take the ride
I don't need to see the other side
So go and do like you do, I'm good to do like me
Ain't in a cage so I don't need to take the key
Oh, damn, can't you see I'm doin' fine?
I don't need to see the other side

[Bridge: Hugh Jackman & Zac Efron]
Now is this really how you like to spend your days?
Whiskey and misery, and parties and plays
If I were mixed up with you, I'd be the talk of the town
Disgraced and disowned, another one of the clowns
But you would finally live a little, finally laugh a little
Just let me give you the freedom to dream
And it'll wake you up and cure your achin'
Take your walls and start 'em breakin'
Now that's a deal that seems worth takin'
But I guess I'll leave that up to you

[Verse 3: Zac Efron & Hugh Jackman]
Well, it's intriguing, but to go would cost me greatly
So what percentage of the show would I be taking?
Fair enough, you'd want a piece of all the action
I'd give you seven, we could shake and make it happen
I wasn't born this morning, eighteen would be just fine
Why not just go ahead and ask for nickels on the dime?
Fifteen
I'd do eight
Twelve
Maybe nine
Ten
[Chorus: Both, Zac Efron, Hugh Jackman]
Don't you wanna get away
To a whole new part you're gonna play?
'Cause I got what you need so come with me and take the ride
To the other side
So we can do like I do, so if you do like me
Forget the cage 'cause we know how to make the key
Oh, damn, suddenly we're free to fly
We're goin' to the other side

[Outro: Zac Efron, Hugh Jackman, Both]
So if you do like I do (To the other side)
So if you do like me (We're goin' to the other side)
'Cause if we do, we're goin' to the other side
We're goin' to the other side
