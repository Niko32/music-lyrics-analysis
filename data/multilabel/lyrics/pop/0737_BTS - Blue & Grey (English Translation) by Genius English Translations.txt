Where is my angel?
The end of a tiring day
Someone come and save me, please
Is overshadowed by a sigh
I guess everyone's happy
Can you look at me? 'Cause I am blue and grey
The tears reflected in the mirror mean
My colors hid in the smile, blue and grey

[Verse 1: SUGA]
I really don’t know what went wrong
I grew up with a blue question mark in my mind
Maybe that’s why I’ve been fighting for my life
But looking behind, I’m standing hеre dazed
The powеrful shadow swallows me
The question mark is still blue
Is it anxiety or depression?
Am I just an animal that regrets
Or is it me born out of loneliness?
I still don't know, the ferocious blue
I hope I don't get eaten away, I'll find the exit

[Chorus: Jin, Jung Kook, Jimin, V]
I just wanna be happier
Melt me, I'm cold
I've reached out my hand countless times
The echo is colorless
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself 
I just wanna be happier
Am I being too greedy?
You might also like[Post-Chorus: Jungkook & Jin, Jimin & V]
I still feel my heart
Breathe faster like when
I walked on the cold winter streets
Don't say you're fine
'Cause you're not
Please don't leave me alone, it hurts too much

[Verse 2: j-hope, RM]
The road I always walk and the light I always receive
But today seems like an unfamiliar scene
Have I become used to it or have I collapsed?
This piece of metal does feel heavy
A grey rhino approaches
I just stand there without focus
I don't feel like myself at this moment
I'm just not scared
I don't believe in a God called conviction
Words like 'color' embarrass me
The wide grey zone is comfortable
With hundreds of millions of grey faces
When it rains, I dance
Over this city, my world
Raise a toast to
The fog on clear days
And all the dust always
Here with me on rainy days
[Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin, V, Jin]
I just wanna be happier
Please feel the warmth in my hands
They're cold, that's why I need more of you
Oh, this ground feels so heavier
I am singing by myself
If I laugh in the future far away
I'll tell you that I did

[Outro: V]
After secretly taking back words floating in the air
I now fall asleep at dawn, good night
