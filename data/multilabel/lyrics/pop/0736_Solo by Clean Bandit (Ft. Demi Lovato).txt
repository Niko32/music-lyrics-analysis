It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, e-e-e-everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
(Woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop, woop)

[Verse 1: Demi Lovato & KAMILLE]
I never meant to leave you hurtin'
I never meant to do the worst thing
Not to you (It solo, solo, everybody)
'Cause every time I read your message
I wish I wasn't one of your exes
Now I'm the fool (It solo, solo, everybody)

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Since you've been gone
I've been dancin' on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on
'Cause, baby, you're
The only one I'm comin' for
I can't take no more
No more, no more

[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I wanna f— (Woop, woop, woop), but I'm brokenhearted
Cry-cry-cry, but I like to party
Tou-tou-touch, but I got nobody
Here on my own
I wanna f— (Woop, woop, woop), but I'm brokenhearted
Cry-cry-cry since the day we parted
Tou-tou-touch, but I got nobody
So I do it solo

It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, e-e-e-everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
(I do it solo)
It solo, solo, everybody
It solo, e-e-e-everybody
It solo, solo, everybody
(I do it solo)

[Verse 2: Demi Lovato & KAMILLE]
Every single night, I lose it
I can't even hear the music
Without you (It solo, solo, everybody)
Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah
Try to stop myself from callin'
But I really wanna know if you're with
Someone new (It solo, solo, everybody)

[Pre-Chorus: Demi Lovato]
Since you've been gone
I've been dancin' on my own
There's boys up in my zone
But they can't turn me on (Can't turn me on)
'Cause, baby, you're
The only one I'm comin' for
I can't take no more
No more, no more
[Chorus: Demi Lovato]
I wanna f— (Woop, woop, woop), but I'm brokenhearted
