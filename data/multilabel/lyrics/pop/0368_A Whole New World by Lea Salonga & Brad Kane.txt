I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, Princess
Now, when did you last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

[JASMINE]
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now, I'm in a whole new world with you

[ALADDIN]
Now I'm in a whole new world with you
You might also like[JASMINE]
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

[JASMINE, ALADDIN]
A whole new world (Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (Hold your breath, it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

[ALADDIN, JASMINE]
A whole new world (Every turn a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue (Every moment red-letter)

[ALADDIN & JASMINE]
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

[ALADDIN]
A whole new world

[JASMINE]
A whole new world
[ALADDIN]
That's where we'll be

[JASMINE]
That's where we'll be

[ALADDIN]
A thrilling chase

[JASMINE]
A wondrous place

[ALADDIN & JASMINE]
For you and me
