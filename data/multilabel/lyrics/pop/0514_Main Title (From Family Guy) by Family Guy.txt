It seems today that all you see
Is violence in movies and sex on TV
[Bridge: Peter Griffin]
But where are those good old-fashioned values...
[Bridge: The Griffins]
On which we used to rely?!

[Chorus: All]
Lucky there's a family guy!
Lucky there's a man who
Positively can do
All the things that make us...

[Fill: Stewie Griffin]
Laugh and cry!
[Outro: All]
He's our Family Guy!You might also like
