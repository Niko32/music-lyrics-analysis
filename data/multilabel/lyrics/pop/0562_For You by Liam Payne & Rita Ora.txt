In your eyes, I'm alive
Inside you're beautiful, something so unusual
In your eyes, I know I'm home, yeah
Every tear, every fear
Gone with the thought of you, changing what I thought I knew
I'll be yours for a thousand lives

[Pre-Chorus: Rita Ora]
I'm free as a bird when I'm flying in your cage
I'm diving in deep and I'm riding with no brakes
And I'm bleeding in love when you're swimming in my veins
You got me now

[Chorus: Rita Ora]
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't looking for love 'til I found you
Ooh, na-na, ayy
For love 'til I found you, oh

[Verse 2: Liam Payne with Rita Ora]
Skin to skin, breathe me in
Feeling your kiss on me, lips are made of ecstasy
I'll be yours for a thousand lives (For a thousand lives)

You've got me now (Now, now, now)

[Chorus: Rita Ora & Liam Payne]
Been waiting for a lifetime for ya
Been breaking for a lifetime for ya
Wasn't looking for love 'til I found you
Ooh, na-na, ayy
For love 'til I found you, oh

Wasn't looking for love 'til I found you
