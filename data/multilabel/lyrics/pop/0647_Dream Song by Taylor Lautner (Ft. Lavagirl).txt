Close your eyes, shut your mouth
Dream a dream and get us out
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream

[Verse 2]
Hit the hay, fast asleep
Dream a dream, you little bleep
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream

[Verse 3]
Just relax, lay about
Or my fist will put you out
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream

[Verse 4]
Take your time, but beware
There is darkness in the air
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dream

[Verse 5]
Don't despair, step right up
Glass of water, here's a cup
Dream, dream, dream, dream, dream, dreamYou might also like
