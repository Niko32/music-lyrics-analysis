Oh-oh

[Verse 1: Chilli & Left Eye]
A scrub is a guy that thinks he's fly
And is also known as a busta (Busta, busta)
Always talkin' 'bout what he wants
And just sits on his broke ass, so

[Pre-Chorus: Chilli & Left Eye]
No, I don't want your number (Uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
No, I don't wanna give you mine and
No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere (No)
No, don't want none of your time and (Uh)

[Chorus: Chilli & T-Boz, Left Eye]
No, I don't want no scrub (Uh)
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me (Woo)
I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me (Uh-uh, no love)
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride (Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh)
Trying to holla at me

[Verse 2: Chilli & Left Eye]
Well a scrub checkin' me, but his game is kinda weak
And I know that he cannot approach me
'Cause I'm lookin' like class and he's lookin' like trash
Can't get wit' a deadbeat ass, so (Yeah)

No, I don't want your number
No, I don't wanna give you mine and (Said no)
No, I don't wanna meet you nowhere
No, don't want none of your time (Check it)

[Chorus: Chilli & T-Boz, Left Eye]
No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me (Uh-huh, come on)
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me (Ha)
I don't want no scrub (No scrubs)
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me (Uh-uh, no love)
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me

[Bridge: Chilli & Left Eye]
If you don't have a car and you're walkin'
Oh, yes son, I'm talkin' to you
If you live at home with your momma
Oh, yes son, I'm talkin' to you (Baby)
If you have a shorty that you don't show love
Oh, yes son (Yeah, yeah), I'm talkin' to you (Yeah, yeah)
Wanna get with me with no money
Oh no, I don't want no
No (No scrubs) scrub (No love)
No (No scrubs) scrub
No, no (No love)
No (Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, no scrubs) scrub
No, no, no, no (Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh, no love)
No (Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh) scrub
No, no (Uh, uh)
[Chorus: Chilli & T-Boz, Left Eye]
No, I don't want no scrub (No scrubs)
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side (Yeah) of his best friend's ride, oh
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrub, no
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me
Hangin' out the passenger side (Uh, uh) of his best friend's ride (Yeah)
Trying to holla at me, yeah
[Verse 3: Left Eye]
See, if you can't spatially expand my horizons (Horizons)
Then that leaves you in the class with scrubs, never risin' (Risin')
I don't find it surprisin' if you don't have the Gs (Gs)
To please me and bounce from here to the coast of overseas
So (So), let me give you somethin' to think about (Think about)
Inundate your mind with intentions to turn you out (Turn you out)
Can't forget the focus on the picture in front of me (In front of me)
You as clear as DVD on digital TV screens (Digital TV screens)
Satisfy my appetite with somethin' spectacular (Spectacular)
Check your vernacular, and then I'll get back to ya (Back to ya)
With diamond-like precision, insatiable is what I envision (Envision)
Can't detect acquisition from your friend's Expedition
Mister (Mister) Big Willy, if you really wanna know (Know, know)
Ask Chilli, could I be a silly ho? (Ho, ho) Not really
T-Boz and all my se√±oritas are steppin' on your FILAs
But you don't hear me though (But you don't hear me though)
[Chorus: Chilli & T-Boz, Left Eye]
No, I don't want no scrub (No)
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me (Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh)
Hangin' out the passenger side (Uh) of his best friend's ride (Yeah)
Trying to holla at me
I don't want no scrub, no (No scrub)
A scrub is a guy that can't get no love from me (No love)
Hangin' out the passenger side of his best friend's ride
Trying to holla at me
