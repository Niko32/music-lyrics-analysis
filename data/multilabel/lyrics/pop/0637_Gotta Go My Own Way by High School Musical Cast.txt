Troy, listen

[Verse 1: Gabriella]
I gotta say what's on my mind
Somethin' about us doesn't seem right these days
Life keeps gettin' in the way
Whenever we try, somehow, the plan is always rearranged

[Pre-Chorus: Gabriella]
It's so hard to say
But I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay

[Chorus: Gabriella]
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way (My own way)

[Verse 2: Gabriella]
Don't wanna leave it all behind
But I get my hopes up and I watch them fall every time
Another color turns to gray
And it's just too hard to watch it all slowly fade away
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Gabriella]
I'm leavin' today
'Cause I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay

[Chorus: Gabriella]
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way

[Bridge: Troy, Gabriella & Both]
What about us?
What about everything we've been through?
And what about trust?
You know I never wanted to hurt you
And what about me?
What am I supposed to do?
I gotta leave but I'll miss you, oh

[Chorus: Gabriella & Troy]
So, I've got to move on and be who I am (Why do you have to go?)
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand (I'm tryin' to understand)
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now (I want you to stay)
I gotta go my own way
I've got to move on and be who I am (What about us?)
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand (I'm tryin' to understand)
We might find our place in this world someday (World someday)
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
[Outro: Gabriella]
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way
