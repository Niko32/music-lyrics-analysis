Maybe he's right, maybe there is something the matter with me
I just don't see how a world that makes such wonderful things could be bad

[Verse 1]
Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl?
The girl who has everythin'?
Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Looking around here, you think, "Sure, she's got everythin'"
I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
I've got whozits and whatzits galore
You want thingamabobs? I've got twenty!
But who cares? No big deal
I want more

[Pre-Chorus]
I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see 'em dancin'
Walking around on those—, what do you call 'em? Oh, feet
Flippin' your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumpin', dancin'
Strolling along down a—, what's that word again? Street
You might also like[Chorus]
Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wanderin' free
Wish I could be part of that world

[Verse 2]
What would I give if I could live out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day warm on the sand?
Bet'cha on land they understand
Bet they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women sick of swimmin'
Ready to stand

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm ready to know what the people know
Ask 'em my questions and get some answers
What's a fire and why does it—, what's the word? Burn?

[Chorus]
When's it my turn? Wouldn't I love
Love to explore that shore up above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be part of that world
