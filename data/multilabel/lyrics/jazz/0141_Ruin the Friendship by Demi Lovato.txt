Put down your cigar and pick me up (Pick me up)
Play me your guitar, that song I love (Song I love)
Thirsty for your love, fill up my cup (Up my cup)
I got only good intentions, so give me your attention

[Pre-Chorus]
You're only brave in the moonlight
So why don't you stay 'til sunrise?

[Chorus]
Your body's looking good tonight
I'm thinking we should cross the line
Let's ruin the friendship, let's ruin the friendship
Do all the things on our minds
What's taking us all this time?
Let's ruin the friendship, let's ruin the friendship

[Verse 2]
Baby, you and I got history (History)
And we can't deny our chemistry (Chemistry)
So why the fuck are we a mystery? (Mystery)
Let's just go with the connection, give me your affection

[Pre-Chorus]
You're only brave in the moonlight
So why don't you stay 'til sunrise?
You might also like[Chorus]
Your body's looking good tonight
I'm thinking we should cross the line
Let's ruin the friendship, let's ruin the friendship
Do all the things on our minds
What's taking us all this time?
Let's ruin the friendship, let's ruin the friendship

[Bridge]
No, I can't keep denying every minute I think of you
No, I can't keep denying every minute I think of you
No, I can't keep denying every minute I think of you
No, I can't keep denying every minute I think of you

[Chorus]
Your body's looking good tonight
I'm thinking we should cross the line
Let's ruin the friendship, let's ruin the friendship
Do all the things on our minds
What's taking us all this time?
Let's ruin the friendship, let's ruin the friendship
