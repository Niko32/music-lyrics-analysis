[Verse 1]
Bésame, bésame mucho
Each time I cling to your kiss
I hear music divine
So, bésame, bésame mucho
I'll love you forever
Say that you'll always be mine

Dearest one, if you should leave me
Then each little dream will take wings
And my life would be through
Oh, bésame, bésame mucho
Ooh, love me forever
Make all my dreams come true

My arms they're folding you
Never knew this thrill before
Whoever thought I'd be
Holding you close to me
Whispering, "It's you I adore?"
