Unforgettable, that's what you are
Unforgettable, though near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before has someone been more
Unforgettable in every way
And forevermore (And forevermore)
That's how you'll stay (That's how you'll stay)
That's why darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable too

[Bridge: Natalie Cole]
No, never before has someone been more

[Verse 2: Natalie Cole & Nat King Cole]
Ooh, unforgettable (Unforgettable)
In every way (In every way)
And forevermore (And forevermore)
That's how you'll stay (That's how you'll stay)

[Outro: Natalie Cole & Nat King Cole]
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am unforgettable, tooYou might also like
