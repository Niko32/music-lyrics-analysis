Side by side

[Verse 1]
Oh, we ain't got a barrel of money
Maybe we're ragged and funny
But we'll travel along singing a song
Side by side
We don't know what's coming tomorrow
Maybe it's trouble and sorrow
But we'll travel the road sharing our load
Side by side

[Bridge]
Through all kinds of weather
What if the sky should fall
As long as we're together
It doesn't matter at all

[Verse 2]
When they've all had their quarrels and parted
We'll be the same as we started
Just to travel along singing a song
Side by side

When they've all had their quarrels and parted
We'll be the same as we started
Just to travel along singing a song
Side by side

[Outro]
Side by side
