Well it’s like he said, I’m an outdoor girl

[COMPANY]
Livin' it, livin' it up

[PERSEPHONE]
Married to the king of the Underworld

[COMPANY]
Livin' it up on top

[PERSEPHONE]
Trying to enjoy myself

[COMPANY]
Livin' it, livin' it up

[PERSEPHONE]
Six months out of every twelve

[COMPANY]
Livin' it up on top

[PERSEPHONE]
When the sun is high, brother, so am I
Drinking dandelion wine
Brother, I’m as free as a honeybee
In a summertime frame of mind
And when my man comes around
Oh, I know he’s gonna bring me down
But for now I’m livin' it
You might also like[COMPANY]
How are you livin' it?

[PERSEPHONE]
Livin' it, livin' it up
Brother, right here I’m livin' it

[COMPANY]
Where are you livin' it?

[PERSEPHONE]
Livin' it up on top!

[ORPHEUS]
Now why would a man of his own free will--

[HERMES, spoken]
He’s talking about your man!

[ORPHEUS]
-- go to work all day in the mine, in the mill?

[PERSEPHONE, spoken]
You think I give a damn?

[ORPHEUS]
Why would he trade the sunshine--
[PERSEPHONE, spoken]
Tell him how it is, brother!

[ORPHEUS]
-- for a couple of nickels and dimes?
Oh, up on top a man can breathe when he’s-

[COMPANY]
Livin' it, livin' it up

[ORPHEUS]
Picking fruit in the orchard trees

[COMPANY]
Livin' it up on top

[ORPHEUS]
No one here’s a millionaire, but we’re-

[COMPANY]
Livin' it, livin' it up

[ORPHEUS]
What we have, we have to share!

[COMPANY]
Livin' it up on top
[ORPHEUS]
Come on! Say, brother, give me a lyre and a campfire
And an open field at night
Give me the sky that you can’t buy
Or sell at any price
And I’ll give you a song for free
‘Cause that’s how life oughta be!
So that’s how I’m livin' it!

[COMPANY]
How are you livin' it?

[ORPHEUS]
Livin' it, livin' it up
Oh, brother, right here we’re livin' it

[COMPANY]
Where are you livin' it?

[ORPHEUS]
Livin' it up on top

[HERMES, spoken]
And that is how the summer went

[PERSEPHONE. spoken]
Oh, I’m just getting started!

[HERMES, spoken]
Oh, the flowers bloomed and the fruit got ripe

[PERSEPHONE, spoken]
Who says times are hard?

[HERMES, spoken]
And the lovers took each other by the hand

[PERSEPHONE, spoken]
Anybody want a drink?

[HERMES, spoken]
And danced underneath the sky

[PERSEPHONE]
Up on top we ain’t got much
But we’re-

[COMPANY]
Livin' it, livin' it up

[PERSEPHONE]
Just enough to fill our cups

[COMPANY]
Livin' it up on top

[PERSEPHONE]
Brother, pass that bottle around, cause we’re-

[COMPANY]
Livin' it, livin' it up

[PERSEPHONE]
Let the poet bless this round!

[ORPHEUS, spoken]
To the patroness of all of this: Persephone!

[HERMES, spoken]
Here, here!

[ORPHEUS]
To the sunshine and the fruit of the vine
She gives us every year
Asking nothing in return, except that we should live
And learn to live as brothers in this life
And to trust she will provide
If no one takes too much, there will always be enough
She will always fill our cups
And we will always raise them up!
[raises his cup]
(spoken)
Let the world we dream about be the one we live in now!
(takes a drink)
‘Cause right now we’re livin' it-

[COMPANY]
How are you livin' it?

[ORPHEUS]
Livin' it, livin' it up
Brother, right here we're livin’ it

[COMPANY]
Where are you livin' it?

[ORPHEUS]
Listen here, I’ll tell you where we’re livin' it!
Up on top!

[COMPANY]
Up on top!

[ORPHEUS]
Livin' it up and we ain’t gonna stop!
Livin' it, livin' it

[COMPANY]
Livin' it, livin' it
Livin' it up on top!
