You know I act, you know I act
Like it doesn't hurt, no
Like it doesn't hurt, no
And no effect, and no effect
You drag me in your dirt, oh
Like it doesn't hurt, no

[Chorus: Charlotte Cardin]
I've been around your body upside down
I've been around your body upside down
But I can't touch you
In any fuckin' way

[Verse 2: Charlotte Cardin]
I know you are, I know you are
So lovely, it's absurd
'Cause it doesn't hurt
I know you are, I know you are
Just like a wounded bird
Like it doesn't hurt

[Chorus: Charlotte Cardin]
I've been around your body upside down
I've been around your body upside down
But I can't touch you
In any fuckin' way

It's heartless fuckin' Huss for a reason
It's peace goodbye, block when I leave 'em, yeah
(Like it doesn't hurt)
Then you might never hear a peep from a nigga
Show my gold teeth when I see you in the streets with a nigga
Sim simma, it's me got the girl dem suga
It's plenty of fish gettin' hook up
A whole leap a bitch gettin' shook up and left with the juke button
Whenever we fight, it's never your fault
So whenever you talk, I turn into a wall
And then you want the balls and I'm like, "Nah"
Ain't no time for that, I'm a boss got more control then that
So go find you a nigga that would crawl for that
And wasting my time, I'll show you how I get down
And when you wanna step out of line, I could step out
Of my main character and switch up the story now damn
Look at that all of a sudden it's pouring, it's gory

[Chorus: Charlotte Cardin, Husser]
I've been around your body upside down
I've been around your body upside down
But I can't touch you
I've been around your body upside down (I've been around you)
(I can't touch, you can't touch)
(And I don't fuck with you)
I've been around (I've been around)
Your body upside down (Upside down, yeah)
But I can't touch you
(You can't touch me and I don't fuck with you)
In any fuckin' way
