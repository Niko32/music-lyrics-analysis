Daddy started out in San Francisco
Tootin' on his trumpet loud and mean
Suddenly a voice said, "Go forth, Daddy
Spread the picture on a wider screen"
And the voice said, "Daddy, there's a million pigeons
Ready to be hooked on new religions
Hit the road, Daddy, leave your commonlaw wife
Spread the religion of the rhythm of life"

[Chorus]
And the rhythm of life is a powerful beat
Puts a tingle in your fingers and a tingle in your feet
Rhythm in your bedroom, rhythm in the street
Yes, the rhythm of life is a powerful beat

[Bridge]
To feel the rhythm of life
To feel the powerful beat
To feel the tingle in your fingers
To feel the tingle in your feet
And the rhythm of life is a powerful beat
Puts a tingle in your fingers and a tingle in your feet
Rhythm in your bedroom, rhythm in the street
Yes, the rhythm of life is a powerful beat

Daddy spread the gospel in Milwaukee
Took his walkie-talkie to Rocky Ridge
Blew his way to Canton then to Scranton
'Til he landed under the Manhattan Bridge
Daddy was the new sensation
Got himself a congregation
Built up quite an operation down below
With the pie-eyed piper blowing
While the muscatel was flowing
All the cats were go, go, going down below
Daddy was the new sensation
Got himself a congregation
Built up quite an operation down below
With the pie-eyed piper blowing
While the muscatel was flowing
All the cats were go, go, going down below

[Bridge]
Flip your wings and fly to Daddy
Flip your wings and fly to Daddy
Flip your wings and fly to Daddy
Fly, fly, fly to Daddy

Take a dive and swim to Daddy
Take a dive and swim to Daddy
Take a dive and swim to Daddy
Swim, swim, swim to Daddy
Hit the floor and crawl to Daddy
Hit the floor and crawl to Daddy
Hit the floor and crawl to Daddy
Crawl, crawl, crawl to Daddy

[Harmonizing]
[Scatting]

[Chorus]
And the rhythm of life is a powerful beat
Puts a tingle in your fingers and a tingle in your feet
Rhythm in your bedroom, rhythm in the street
Yes, the rhythm of life is a powerful beat

[Outro]
To feel the rhythm of life
To feel the powerful beat
To feel the tingle in your fingers
To feel the tingle in your feet

Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh

To feel the rhythm of life
To feel the powerful beat
To feel the tingle in your fingers
To feel the tingle in your feet
Flip your wings and fly to your Daddy
Take a dive and swim to your Daddy
Hit the floor and crawl to Daddy
Daddy, we got the rhythm of life

Of life, of life, of life
Yeah (Yeah), let me hear it (Yeah)
Sock it to me (Yeah), let it all hang out
