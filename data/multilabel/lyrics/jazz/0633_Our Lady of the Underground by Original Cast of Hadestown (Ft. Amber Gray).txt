I don’t know about you, boys
But if you’re like me
Then hanging around this old manhole
Is bringing you down
Six-feet-under
Getting under your skin
Cabin fever is a-setting in
You’re stir crazy!
You’re stuck in a rut!
Or you could use a little pick-me-up
I can give you what it is you crave
A little something from the good old days

I got the wind right here in a jar
I got the rain on tap at the bar
I got sunshine up on the shelf
Allow me to introduce myself:

Brother, what’s my name?
My name is-

[COMPANY]
Our Lady of the Underground!

[PERSEPHONE]

[PERSEPHONE]

My name is…

[COMPANY]
Our Lady of the Upside Down!

[PERSEPHONE]
Wanna know my name?
I’ll tell you my name-
Persephone!

Come here, brother- let me guess:
It’s the little things you miss
Spring flowers
Autumn leaves
Ask me, brother, and you shall receive
Or maybe these just ain’t enough
Maybe you’re looking for some stronger stuff
I got a sight for the sorest eye
When’s the last time you saw the sky?
Wipe away your tears, brother
Brother, I know how you feel
I can see you’re blinded by the sadness of it all
But look a little closer and
Everything will be revealed
Look a little closer and
There’s a crack in the wall!
[PERSEPHONE introduces the band]

You want stars? [COMPANY cheers] I got a skyful!
Put a quarter in the slot, you’ll get an eyeful
You want the moon?
I got her too
She’s right here waiting in my pay-per-view

How long’s it been?
A little moonshine ain’t no sin
One at a time, boys
Straight line
What the boss don’t know
The boss won’t mind
