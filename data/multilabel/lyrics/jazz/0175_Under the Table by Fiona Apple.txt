I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me

[Verse 1]
I told you I didn't wanna go to this dinner
You know I don't go for those ones that you bother about
So when they say something that makes me start to simmer
That fancy wine won't put this fire out, oh

[Chorus]
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up

[Verse 2]
I'd like to buy you a pair of pillow-soled hiking boots
To help you with your climb
Or rather, to help the bodies that you step over along your route
So they won't hurt like mine

[Chorus]
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
And if I don't wanna go, leave me alone
Don't push me, cookie, don't push me, don't you push me
If you get me to go and I open my mouth
To the fucking mutton that they're talking about
You can pout, but don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you shush me

[Chorus]
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (But begging disagrees with me)
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (But begging disagrees with me)

[Post-Chorus]
And if I don't wanna go, leave me alone
Don't push me, cookie, don't push me, don't you push me
If you get me to go and I open my mouth
To the fucking mutton that they're talking about
You can pout, but don't you, don't you
Don't you, don't you, don't you shush me
[Bridge]
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me
I would beg to disagree
But begging disagrees with me

[Chorus]
Kick me under the table all you want
I won't shut up, I won't shut up
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (I would beg to disagree)
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (But begging disagrees with me)
Kick me under the table all you want (I would beg to disagree)
I won't shut up, I won't shut up (But begging disagrees with me)
