Mm

[Verse 1]
Beautiful stranger sitting right there
Looked up at me and my dark curly hair
Looked back for a second, didn't want to be rude
I tend to fall in love on the tube
Mm

[Verse 2]
Beautiful stranger sitting right there
Reading the newspaper, stuck to his chair
I swore that he smiled and I felt my heart drop
Heard the doors open, came to my stop
Mm

[Chorus]
What if I hadn't left the train
At Ladbroke Grove? Would I know his name?
Maybe we would have exchanged a few words
A fairy-talе moment could have occurred
But my bеautiful stranger will have to remain
A stranger until I see him again
See him again
Mm-mm

Beautiful stranger catching my stare
It's fate we collided right then back there
I wonder if he felt the same thing too
Innocent crush on the morning commute
Mm

[Chorus]
What if I would've stayed on the train?
Dared to stand up and ask for his name
Maybe we would have exchanged a few words
A fairy-tale moment could have occurred
But my beautiful stranger will have to remain
A stranger until I see him again
See him again
Mm-mm

[Outro]
My beautiful stranger will have to remain
A love that came and left with this train
My beautiful stranger
