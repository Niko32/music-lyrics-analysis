Some folks were meant to live in clover
But they are such a chosen few
And clovers being green is something I've never seen
'Cause I was born to be blue

[Verse 2]
When there's a yellow moon above me
They say there's moonbeams I should view
But moonbeams being gold are something I can't behold
'Cause I was born to be blue

[Pre-Chorus]
When I met you, the world was bright and sunny
When you left, the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh, but there's nothing that strikes me funny
Now my world's a faded pastel

[Chorus]
Well, I guess I'm luckier than some folks
I've known the thrill of loving you
And that alone is more than I was created for
'Cause I was born to be blue

[Pre-Chorus]
When I met you, the world was bright and sunny
When you left, the curtain fell
I'd like to laugh, but nothing strikes me funny
Now my world's a faded pastel
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, I guess I'm luckier than some folks
I've known the thrill of loving you
And that alone is more than I was created for
'Cause I was born to be blue
'Cause I was born to be blue
'Cause I was born to be blue
