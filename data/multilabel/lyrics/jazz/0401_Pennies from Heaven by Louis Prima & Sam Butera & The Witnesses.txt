And every time it rains, it rains
Pennies from heaven (Shooby-dooby)
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven? (Shooby-dooby)
You'll find your fortune fallin' all over town
Be sure that your umbrella
Is up-up-up-up-upside down

[Verse 2]
And trade them for a package of
Sunshine and ravioli (Macaroni)
If you want the thing you love
You must have a pizzaiolo, baby
And when you hear thunder, don't run under a tree
It'll be pennies from heaven, for you and me

[Verse 3]
Now come over here boy, Sam
And every time it rains it rains
And don't you know each cloud contains
Every time it rains, it rains
And don't you know each cloud contains
You'll find your fortune fallin'
All over town, all over town, all over town
Be sure that your umbrella
Is upside down, twiddily-bop

How-bout-dootie hoos-a-white
Eagle-a my-hoong-a-lee
Zoop-ba-loo the zoop-a-loot
Oh, boldily boy-zoy
Hey, babba ho-boy
Ooh boy, the while bite
Toodly-woo, ooh!
I knew I'd get you, I knew I'd get you
Let's go, let's go, let's go

[Bridge]
Hey!
There it goes
Yeah, it's sublime
Yeah, blow it Jerome!
(Talk!) Yeah!
Pennies from heaven
Your fortune all over town
Go and move it, ha!

[Outro]
And you'll find your fortune fallin' all over town
It'll be pennies from heaven
Pennies from heaven
The pennies from heaven
For you and me
