Here I come, rougher than the rest of them
The best of them, tougher than leather
You can call me Knuckles, unlike Sonic I don't chuckle
I'd rather flex my muscles
I'm hard as nails, it ain't hard to tell
I break 'em down whether they solid or frail
Unlike the rest I'm independent since my first breath, first test
Feel the right then the worst's left

[Verse 1: Marlon Saunders]
Born on an island in the heavens
The blood of my ancestors flows inside me
My duty is to save the flower
From evil deterioration

[Refrain 2: Dred Foxx]
I will be the one to set your heart free true
Cleanse yourself of them evil spirits that's in you

[Verse 2: Marlon Saunders]
Streaking lights, loud sounds, and instinct
Are the elements that keep me going
I am fighting my own mission
Nothing's gonna stand in my way
You might also like[Refrain 2: Dred Foxx]
I will be the one to set your heart free true
Cleanse yourself of them evil spirits that's in you

[Chorus: Marlon Saunders]
Won't be frightened, I'll stand up to all the pain and turmoil
Just believe in myself, won't rely on others
Get this power to wipe out the havoc and anarchy
This is my planet, gonna fight for my destiny

[Refrain 1: Dred Foxx]
Here I come, rougher than the rest of them
The best of them, tougher than leather
You can call me Knuckles, unlike Sonic I don't chuckle
I'd rather flex my muscles
I'm hard as nails, it ain't hard to tell
I break 'em down whether they solid or frail
Unlike the rest I'm independent since my first breath, first test
Feel the right then the worst's left

[Verse 3: Marlon Saunders]
I have no such things as weak spots
Don't approve of him, but got to trust him
This alliance has a purpose
This partnership is only temporary
[Refrain 2: Dred Foxx]
I will be the one to set your heart free true
Cleanse yourself of evil spirits that got in you

[Chorus: Marlon Saunders]
Won't be frightened, I'll stand up to all the pain and turmoil
Just believe in myself, won't rely on others
Freedom will be waiting when serenity is restored
This is my planet, I shall not surrender

[Saxophone Solo]

[Chorus: Marlon Saunders]
Won't be frightened, I'll stand up to all the pain and turmoil
Just believe in myself, won't rely on others
Get this power to wipe out the havoc and anarchy
This is my planet, gonna fight (Oh)
I won't be frightened, I'll stand up to all the pain and turmoil
Just believe in myself, won't rely on others
Freedom will be waiting when serenity is restored
This is my planet, I shall not surrender

[Post-Chorus: Marlon Saunders]
Yeah, shall not surrender, no
Yeah, whoo, whoo!
[Outro: Dred Foxx]
The new porcupine on the block with the puffed chest
Out the wilderness with the ruggedness
Knock, knock, it's Knuckles, the blow thrower
Independent flower, magical Emerald holder
Give you the coldest shoulder
My spike goes through boulders
That's why I stay a loner
I was born by myself
I don't need a posse, I get it on by myself
Adversaries get shelved
Right on
