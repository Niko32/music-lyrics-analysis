And I can hardly speak, my heart is beating so and anyone can tell
You think you know me well
Well, you don't know me

No, you don't know the one
Who dreams of you at night and longs to kiss your lips
And longs to hold you tight, oh, I'm just a friend
That's all I've ever been 'cause you don't know me

For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I've let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too

You give your hand to me and then you say good-bye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh, you'll never know the one who loves you so
Well, you don't know me

For I never knew the art of making love
Though my heart aches with love for you
Afraid and shy, I've let my chance go by
The chance that you might love me too

You give your hand to me and then you say good-bye
I watch you walk away beside the lucky guy
Oh, you'll never know the one who loves you so
You don't know me, mmh-hmm-mmh-mm

Well... You don't know me
