Haven't slept a wink
I walk the floor and watch the door
And in between I drink
Black coffee
Love's a hand-me-down brew
I'll never know a Sunday in this weekday room

I'm talkin to the shadows
One o'clock till four
And Lord, how slow the moments go
When all I do is pour
Black coffee
Since the blues caught my eye
I'm hangin' out on Monday, my Sunday dreams to dry

Now a man is born to go a-lovin'
A woman's born to weep and fret
And stay at home to tend her oven
And down her past regrets
In coffee and cigarettes

I'm moanin' all the morning
Moanin' all the night
And in between it's nicotine
And not much heart to fight
Black coffee
Feelin' low as the ground
It's drivin' me crazy
This waitin' for my baby
