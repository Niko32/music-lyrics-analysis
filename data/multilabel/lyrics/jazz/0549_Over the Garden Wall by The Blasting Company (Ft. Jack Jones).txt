At night when the lake is a mirror
And the moon rides the waves to the shore
A single soul sets his voice singing
Content to be slightly forlorn

[Verse 2]
A song rises over the lilies (Waa-ooh waa-ooh)
Sweeps high to clear over the reeds
And over the bulrushes' swaying
To pluck at a pair of heartstrings

[Verse 3]
Two voices, now they are singing
Then ten as the melody soars
Round the shimmering pond, all are joining in song
As it carries their reverie on

[Verse 4]
Over the treetops and mountains
Over the blackened ravines
Then softly it falls by a house near a stream
And over the garden wall to theeYou might also like
