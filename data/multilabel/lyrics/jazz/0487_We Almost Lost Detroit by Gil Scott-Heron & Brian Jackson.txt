It stands out on a highway
Like a creature from another time
It inspires the babies' questions—"what's that?"
For their mothers as they ride
But no one stopped to think about the babies or
How they would survive, and we
Almost lost Detroit this time
How would we ever get over
Losing our minds?

[Verse 2: Gil Scott-Heron]
Just thirty miles from Detroit
There stands a giant power station
It ticks each night as the city sleeps
Seconds from annihilation
But no one stopped to think about the people
Or how they would survive, and we
Almost lost Detroit this time
How would we ever get over
Over losing our minds?

[Verse 3: Gil Scott-Heron]
The sheriff of Monroe county had
I'm sure enough disasters on his mind
And what would Karen Silkwood say to you
If she was still alive?
That when it comes to people's safety
Money wins out every time
And we almost lost Detroit
This time, this time
How would we ever get over
Over losing our minds?

You see, we almost lost Detroit
That time
Almost lost Detroit
That time
And how would we ever get over...
‘Cause, odds are
We’re gonna lose somewhere one time
Odds are
We’re gonna lose somewhere sometime
And how would we ever get over
Losing our minds?
And how would we ever get over
Losing our minds?
Didn't they, didn't they decide?
When we almost lost Detroit
That time
Damn near totally destroyed
One time
People all over the world know
Say, didn't you know?
People all over the world know
Say, didn't you know when?
We almost lost Detroit
Damn near totally destroyed
Yes, or will one morning
See it clear as day
I’m sitting here, giving you a warning
