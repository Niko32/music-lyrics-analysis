So here we go again
I kissed that girl again
But suddenly it must come to an end
Stop smiling, you know you're so annoying
Your cheeks, your lips, your hips
How it's so tempting
If she really finds out, I'll be dead man walkin'

[Verse]
Your eyes are blue
So good to be true
I just can't stop thinkin' about you
Oh, though we are far apart
You are still my best bud

[Chorus]
So here we go again
I'll fall in love again
Please don't tell that we're gonna be friend
Your love as sweet as honey in a spring
Romantic places you'll be the queen
This time, love, you'll always be in my dream

[Bridge]
It's early, too early
It comes too early
It's easy to remember
But, so hard to forget
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, here we go again
I kissed that girl again
Then suddenly it must come to an end
Stop smiling, you know you're so annoying
Your cheeks, your lips, your hips
How it's so tempting
If she really finds out, I'll be dead man walkin'
If she really finds out, I'll be dead man walkin'
If she really finds out, I'll be dead man walkin'

[Outro]
I'm just a fan
Living my fantasy
Falling in love with the girl I can't see
Fly miles away
With all my dignity
Saving all my fireworks
Will you ever notice me?
Will you ever notice me?
