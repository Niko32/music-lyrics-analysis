I just did a bad thing
I regret the thing I did
And you're wondering what it is
I'll tell you what I did
I did a bad thing

[Verse 1]
I'm having a bad day
It's turning into a bad year
All the things I'm supposed to do
And the places I'm supposed to go
Are canceled (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Hey, what's the name of this game?
And how do you play it?
And how long does it take? (Bing-bong, bay-oh)
And how many times is the game going to change? (Ah)
Hey, let me out of this place
Out into the real world
Where maybe things can go my way
Oh, everything goes my way
Oh, everyone knows my name

[Verse 2]
I'm having a bad dream
I wonder what this bad dream means
I wonder if I'm sad? I wonder if I'm glad?
Or if I'm just having a sad, glad dream?
You might also like[Bridge]
It's a sad, mad, and bad, glad dream
And I won't get mad about the dream
If you promise to believe in me
It's a sad, bad, and mad, glad scheme
It's the best scheme I have
And that's bad enough for me
And I won't get sad if you don't
See just how mad, glad my schemes can be

[Verse 3]
Just did a bad thing, I've ruined everything
And I've let the things I've ruined ruin me

[Chorus]
Hey, what's the name of this game?
And how do you play it?
And how long shall it take? (Bing-bong, bay-oh)
And how many times is the game supposed to change? (Ah)
Hey, get me out of this place
Out into the real world
Where maybe things can go my way
Oh, everything goes my way
Oh, everything goes astray

[Outro]
Just did a strange thing
Now everything's pink
