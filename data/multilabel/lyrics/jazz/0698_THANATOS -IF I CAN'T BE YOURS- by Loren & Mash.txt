Now it's time, I fear to tell
I've been holding it back so long
But something strange deep inside of me is happening
I feel unlike
I've ever felt
And it's making me scared
That I may not be what I think I am

[Verse 2]
What of us? What do I say?
Are we both from a different world?
Cause every breath that I take, I breath it for you
I couldn't face my life without you
And I'm so afraid
There's nothing to comfort us
What am I? If I can't be yours

[Verse 3]
I don't sleep, don't feel a thing
And my senses have all but gone
Can't even cry from the pain, can't shed a tear now
I realize
We're not the same
And it's making me sad
Cause we can't fulfill our dreams in this life

So I must, let us break free
I can never be what you need
If there was a way, through the hurt
Then I would find it
I'd take the blows. Yes I would fight it
But this is the one. Impossible dream to live
What am I? If I can't be yours
