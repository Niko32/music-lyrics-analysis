When the damn thing breaks
I'll be there to take you home
When the damn thing breaks
I'll be there to take your pulse

[Verse]
In the cracks of our skin, there's a memory of a dove, oh
When the dusk dissipates, I'll grow patient like atoll, oh, ah
Heavy, the boulder resting on the blade
Swing low, sweet seesaw, right above your rib cage
Bodies of water, a Kabuki dancer
Dotes on the air and their landing put in prayer

[Chorus]
When the damn thing breaks
I'll be there to take you home, home, home
When the damn thing breaks
I'll be there to take you home (Take you home), home, home
When the damn thing breaks
I'll be there to take you home (Home), home, home
(When the damn thing breaks
I'll be there to take you home)You might also like
