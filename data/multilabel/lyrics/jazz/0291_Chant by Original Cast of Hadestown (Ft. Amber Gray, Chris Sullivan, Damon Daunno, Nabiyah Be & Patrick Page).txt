Low, keep your head, keep your head low
Oh, you gotta keep your head low
If you wanna keep your head
Oh, you gotta keep your head low
Keep your head, keep your head low
Oh, you gotta keep your head low
If you wanna keep your head
Oh, you gotta keep your head --

[PERSEPHONE]
In the coldest time of year
Why is it so hot down here?
Hotter than a crucible
It ain't right and it ain't natural

[HADES]
Lover, you were gone so long
Lover, I was lonesome
So I built a foundry
In the ground beneath your feet
Here, I fashioned things of steel
Oil drums and automobiles
Then I kept that furnace fed
With the fossils of the dead
Lover, when you feel that fire
Think of it as my desire
Think of it as my desire for you!

I'll sing a song of a love gone wrong
[HERMES, spoken]
A love gone wrong, all right!
Every year they have this fight!

[ORPHEUS]
La la la la la la la…

Low, keep your head, keep your head low
Oh, you gotta keep your head low
If you wanna keep your head
Oh, you gotta keep your head low
Keep your head, keep your head low
Oh, you gotta keep your head low
If you wanna keep your head-

[EURYDICE]
Lover, while you sing your song
Winter is a-comin' on
See, I'm stacking firewood
See, I'm putting by some food
Orpheus, all the pretty songs you sing
Ain't gonna shelter us
From the wind, the wind, the wind
[PERSEPHONE]
In the darkest time of year
Why is it so bright down here?
Brighter than a carnival
It ain't right and it ain't natural

[HADES]
Lover, you were gone so long
Lover, I was lonesome
So I laid a power grid
In the ground on which you stood
And wasn't it electrifying
When I made the neon shine!
Silver screen, cathode ray
Brighter than the light of day
Lover, when you see that glare
Think of it as my despair
Think of it as my despair for you!

[ORPHEUS]
I'll sing a song of a love gone wrong

[HERMES, spoken]
And when the gods are having a fight
Everybody else better hold on tight!
[ORPHEUS]
La la la la la la la…

Low, keep your head, keep your head low
Oh, you gotta keep your head low
If you wanna keep your head
Oh, you gotta keep your head low
Keep your head, keep your head low
Oh, you gotta keep your head low
If you wanna keep your head-

[EURYDICE]
While my lover sings his song
Everything I've saved is gone
Nothing left upon the shelf
Fire ain't gonna light itself
Now I see all the pretty songs he sings
Ain't gonna harbor me
From the wind, the wind, the wind

[COMPANY]
Oooh...

[PERSEPHONE]
Every year, it's getting worse
Hadestown, hell on Earth!
Did you think I'd be impressed
With this neon necropolis?
I recall there was a time
We were happy, you and I
In the garden where we met
Nothing was between us yet
Back before your factories
Before your electricity
Back before you built the wall
It ain't right and it ain't natural

[HADES]
Lover, everything I do
I do it for the love of you
If you don't even want my love
I'll give it to someone who does
Someone grateful for her fate
Someone who appreciates
The comforts of a gilded cage
And doesn't try to fly away
The moment Mother Nature calls
Someone who can love these walls
That hold her close and keep her safe
And think of them as my embrace
[ORPHEUS]
Singing: la la la la la la la...

[COMPANY]
Low, keep your head, keep your head low

[EURYDICE]
Shelter us

[HADES]
Think of them as my embrace

[ORPHEUS]
La la la la la la la...

[COMPANY]
Low, keep your head, keep your head-

[EURYDICE]
Harbor me

[HADES]
Think of them as my embrace
Of you
