Late at night when the wind is still
I'll come flying through your door
And you'll know what love is for
I'm a bluebird

[Chorus 1]
I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Verse 2]
Touch your lips with a magic kiss
And you'll be a bluebird too
And you'll know what love can do
I'm a bluebird

[Chorus 1]
I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird, I'm a bluebird
Yeah, yeah, yeah

As we head across the sea

[Verse 5]
All alone on a desert island
We're living in the trees
And we're flying in the breeze
We're the bluebirds

We're the bluebirds, we're the bluebirds, we're the bluebirds

[Outro]
Singing bluebird (bluebird)
