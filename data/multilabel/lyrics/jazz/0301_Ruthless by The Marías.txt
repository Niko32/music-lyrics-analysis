Hello, it's nice to see you again
Did you miss me?
We're meant to be friends
But it feels like a century
In my head

[Verse 2]
If I say something that comes out all wrong
Please forgive me
For feeling this strong
Like it feels just like angels
Hmmm in my head

[Chorus]
But darling the truth is
In darkness I'm ruthless
I wanna scream your name
Again and again

[Verse 3]
Maybe I
Am tempted by all that I see
You're nothing like me
I'm circling the room
In gold and French perfume
You might also like[Chorus]
But darling the truth is
In darkness I'm ruthless
I wanna scream your name
Again and again

[Refrain]
Oh baby, I'm misunderstood
And youâ€™re the only one who knows I could
See it all in black and white
Looking better by my side

Oh baby, I don't want to be
The only one that's talking in my sleep
I could be your lullaby
Be my lover every night

[Bridge]
Can we fly away?
Can we fly away?

[Chorus]
'Cause darling the truth is
In darkness I'm ruthless
I wanna scream your name
Again and again
[Outro]
Oh baby, I don't want to be
The only one that's talking in my sleep
I could be your lullaby
Be my lover every night
