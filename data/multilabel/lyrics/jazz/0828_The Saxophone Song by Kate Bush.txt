You'll find me in a Berlin bar in a corner, brooding
You know that I go very quiet when I'm listening to you
There's something special indeed
There's something special indeed

[Pre-Chorus]
In all the places where I've seen you shine, boy
Something very real in how I feel, honey

[Chorus]
It's in me
It's in me
And you know it's for real
Tuning in on your saxophone

[Post-Chorus]
Da-ba-da-ba-do

[Verse 2]
The candle burning over your shoulder is throwing
Shadows from your saxophone, a surly lady in tremor
The stars that climb from her bowels
Those stars make towers on vowels

[Pre-Chorus]
You'll never see that you had all of me
You'll never see the poetry you've stirred in me
Of all the stars I've seen that shine so brightly
Never known or felt in myself so rightly
You might also like[Chorus]
It's in me
It's in me
And you know it's for real
Tuning in on your saxophone

[Post-Chorus]
Da-ba-da-ba-do
