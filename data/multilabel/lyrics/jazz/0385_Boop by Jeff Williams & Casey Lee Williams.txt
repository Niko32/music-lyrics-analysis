Never knew a time when you weren't by my side
The one thing I could always count on
Always there for me, you've been my family
Even when all other hope was gone
But for a while, things have seemed so different
Like it's the same but still brand new
I can't believe it
When did I start to fall for you?

[Verse 1: Casey Lee Williams]
Have I lost my mind? Have I just been blind?
Never to have seen you might be
Everything I need, everything I dreamed
All along, has it been right in front of me?

[Pre-Chorus: Casey Lee Williams]
We've been together for a long, long, long, long time
I never thought that you and I could be a thing
I can't believe it
This is happening

[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams]
I think, "Oh, well, what am I to do?"
I didn't know that I would fall in love with you
And what to do right now, I haven't got a clue
I just bite my tongue
And when I wanna say I love you, I'll say

[Verse 2: Casey Lee Williams]
Every chatelaine wants to share her reign
So come and join me in my castle
We'll crush our enemies, bring them to their knees
I know I have a tendency to babble
But when I think about you, I can't help my heart from racing
And my mind goes fast and my knees start shakin'
My stomach does flips and my brain does flops
And the feelings that I'm feeling, I don't think that I can stop
I could just say it, "I love you," I proclaim
But I'd have to kill myself if your feelings aren't the same
Maybe I should slow it down, try to show restraint
Hold Magnhild, I think I'm gonna faint

[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams]
I think, "Oh, well, what am I to do?"
I didn't know that I would fall in love with you
And what to do right now, I haven't got a clue
I just bite my tongue
And when I wanna say I love you, I'll say
[Post-Chorus: Casey Lee Williams, Jeff Williams]
(Boop-boop, boop-boop)
(Boop-boop, boop-boop)
I'll say boop
(Boop-boop, boop-boop)
(Boop-boop, boop-boop)
Boo-boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop, boop
(Boop-boop, boop-boop)
(Boop-boop, boop-boop)
When I wanna say I love you, I'll say
Boop
