If I were a human bein', I'd head straight for New Orleans
And I'd blow this horn so hot and strong
Like no one they've ever seen
You've heard of Louis Armstrong, Mr. Sidney Bechet
All those boys gonna step aside
When they hear this old ex-gator play, listen

[Louis plays his horn.]

[LOUIS]
When I'm human, as I hope to be
I'm gonna blow this horn 'til the cows come home
And everyone's gonna bow down to me

(spoken)
Thank you, thank you! Mwah, mwah...
Aw, thank you, I love you too, baby!

[NAVEEN]
When I'm myself again, I want just the life I had
A great big party every night
That doesn't sound too bad
A redhead on my left arm, a brunette on my right
A blonde or two to hold the candles
Now that seems just about right, eh, Louis?
Life is short, when you're done, you're done
We're on this earth to have some fun
And that's the way things are
You might also like[LOUIS, spoken]
Tell it, brother!

[NAVEEN]
When I'm human, and I'm gonna be
I'm gonna tear it up like I did before
And that's a royal guarantee

[TIANA]
Your modesty becomes you
And your sense of responsibility
I've worked hard for everything I've got
And that's the way it's supposed to be
When I'm a human being, at least I'll act like one
If you do your best each and every day
Good things are sure to come your way
Whatcha give is whatcha get
My daddy said that and I'll never forget
And I'll recommend it to you

[LOUIS/NAVEEN/TIANA]
When we're human, and we're gonna be

[LOUIS]
I'm gonna blow my horn!
[Louis plays his horn.]

[NAVEEN]
I'm gonna live the high life

[TIANA]
I'm gonna do my best to take my place in the sun

[LOUIS/NAVEEN/TIANA]
When we're human
