Draw me nearer, Lord, everyday
I'm willing to run all the way
If I faulter while I'm trying
Don't be angry, just let me stay
I'm willing to run all the way

Wasted days, now behind me
Evening sun is sinking fast
Every moment draw me closer
To the end, oh, to the end
I'm gonna hurry, yes, in your service
If you only let me in
I'm willing to run all the wayYou might also like
