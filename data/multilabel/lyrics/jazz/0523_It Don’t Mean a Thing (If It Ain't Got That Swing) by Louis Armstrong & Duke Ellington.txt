What good is melody?
What good is music
If it ain't possessing something sweet?
Now it ain't the melody
And it ain't the music
There's something else that makes this tune complete, yes

[Chorus]
It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
Well, it don't mean a thing
All you got to do is sing
It makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you've got, yes
It don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing
It don't mean a thing, don't mean a thing
If it ain't got that swing, boy
Ba ba doo da da ba boo doo zee, ba boo zoo loo doo, ba zoo zee
I said, don't mean a thing
And all you got to do is sing like
La la, la la, la la, doo loo, doo doo, bee bee, do do do
Now it makes no difference if it's sweet or hot
Just give that rhythm everything you've got, oh
Don't mean a thing, boy
If it ain't got a-that a-swing-a
Uh boo, boo doo, boo boo, boo doo
Take it, Trummy
