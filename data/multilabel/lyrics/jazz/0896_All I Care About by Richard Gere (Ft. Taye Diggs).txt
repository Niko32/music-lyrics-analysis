We want Billy
Where is Billy?
Give us Billy
We want Billy
B, I, double L, Y
We're all his
He's our kind of a guy
And, ooh, what luck
'Cause here he is!

[EMCEE, spoken]
Ladies and gentlemen, presenting the silver-tongued prince of the courtroom, the one, the only, Billy Flynn!

[BILLY (GIRLS)]
I don't care about expensive things
Cashmere coats, diamond rings
Don't mean a thing
All I care about is love
That's what I'm here for (that's what's he's here for)
I don't care for wearing silk cravats
Ruby studs, satin spats
Don't mean a thing
All I care about is love (all he cares about is love)
Gimme two eyes of blue
Softly saying (I need you)
Let me see her standing there
And honest, Mister, I'm a millionaire
I don't care for any fine attire
Vanderbilt might admire
No, no, not me
All I care about is love
(All he cares about is love
That's what he's here for
All he cares about is love)

Show me long raven hair
Flowing down 'bout to there
When I see her running free
Keep your money, that's enough for me!
I don't care for driving packard cars
Or smoking long buck cigars
No, no, not me
All I care about is
Doing the guy in
Who's picking on you
Twisting the wrist
That's turning the screw

All I care about is love (all he cares about is love)
