Our minds, our bodies, our feelings
They change, they alter, they leave us
Somehow, no matter what happens
I'm here

[Verse 2]
The time, the season, the weather
The song, the music, the rhythm
It seems no matter what happens
I'm here

[Chorus]
Daylight seems bright because of night
It's shade we need
So we can see

[Verse 3]
Our love, our beauty, our genius
Our work, our triumph, our glory
Won't worry what happened before me
I'm here

[Verse 4]
Our minds, our bodies, our feelings
They change, they alter, they leave us
Somehow, no matter what happens
I'm here

The time, the season, the weather
The song, the music, the rhythm
It seems no matter what happens
I'm here

[Chorus]
Daylight seems bright because of night
It's shade we need
So we can see

[Verse 6]
Our love, our beauty, our genius
Our work, our triumph, our glory
Won't worry what happened before me
I'm here
Our love, our beauty, our genius
Our work, our triumph, our glory
Won't worry what happened before me
I'm here
Our love, our beauty, our genius
Our work, our triumph, our glory
Won't worry what happened before me
I'm here

[Outro]
I'm here
I'm here
I'm here
