Esto e' Camila Cabello
Y Yotuel en la casa na'ma'

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Lola
Was the smartest in the school, she was a supernova
She had a mind beyond her time, it was a thrill to know her
She had dreams she'd fall in love, some place like Barcelona
Lola, Lola, Lola

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
She coulda walked on the moon, yeah
She coulda found us a cure
But family didn't have no food and
She had to leave school to work
Nobody breaks the ceiling
Nobody where she's from
Nobody breaks the ceiling, yeah

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Nobody's listеning, so she won't speak, won't speak
All of thosе dreams are fading slowly, slowly
She knows the stories 'bout the police, police
It's just the way it is, so don't speak, don't speak

Lola
She believed the world they promised her, but now she's older
She's seen the people disagree and disappear
The power's out for days, no food is on its way
Nothing changes, this ain't the dream they sold us
Lola, Lola, Lola

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
She coulda walked on the moon, yeah
Coulda found us a cure
But she worried about her children
Ninety miles 'til the shore
Nobody breaks the ceiling
Nobody where she's from
Nobody breaks the ceiling, yeah, nobody

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Nobody's listening, so she won't speak, won't speak
All of those dreams are fading slowly, slowly
She knows the stories 'bout the police, police
It's just the way it is, so don't speak, don't speak

[Verse 3: Yotuel with Camila Cabello]
Se pone bien bonita como lista pa' un desfile
Le prometieron ser la reina del Caribe
Pero alguien le cambió el guión de cine
Y comenzar de nuevo solo pide
Del bajo mundo ella proviene
Cuanto vales, cuanto tienes
Ese es el precio de mi Lola cuando no hay salida
Quiere libertad, quiere patria y vida
[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Nobody's listening, so she won't speak, won't speak
All of those dreams are fading slowly, slowly
She knows the stories 'bout the police, police
It's just the way it is, so don't speak, don't speak

[Outro: Yotuel]
Quiso sacarse el dolor matando a su corazón
Ella soñaba volar pero el avión nunca despegó
Cuanto sufre el paso del tiempo y siempre sola
¿En mi Habana cuántas Lolas?
