Champagne flutes and
Dealer suits that
Keep your focus
Away from the cheating hands
Tell Me
Does that sexy
Gown say what she's
Got in store for her man?

[Chorus 1]
So we roll the dice
See where they may fall
Come on, why don't we spin the wheel
See whom it may call
To give into temptation
To win it, or maybe lose it all
Who knows where the whims of fate may lead us

[Verse 2]
Chandeliers and
Decolletes that
Keep your focus
Away from the cheating eyes
Tell me
What's that bow tie
On the card guy
Tell you 'bout his design?
You might also like[Chorus 2]
So we roll the dice
See where they may fall
Come on, why don't we spin the wheel
See whom it may call
Give into...
Another vice
See where it might lead
Come on, let's just enjoy the spice
Of life and feel so free
To give into temptation
