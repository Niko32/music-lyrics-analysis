Oh yeah, the world's turned upside down
Jimmy Finn is out
Well how can that be fair at all

[Chorus 1]
Lenient
The song the lawyer sang
Our nation's wrong

[Verse 2]
Well how can that be fair at all
Repented, changed
Aware where I have wronged

[Chorus 2]
Unfound corrupt
This song the jailor sings
My time has run

[Instrumental]

[Chorus 3]
Sound the victim's song
The trial is gone
The trial goes on
You might also like[Outro]
Sound the victim's song
