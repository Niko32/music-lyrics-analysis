Wave your lighter in the air, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna drive too fast
Ayy, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1: De'Wayne Jackson]
I say I don't wanna drive too fast
'Cause I feel I might crash it, yeah
I don't wanna do that there
I never heard of a thing called fear
That's why I'm at your door looking this way (Looking this way)
The only genius I just left, doing your thang (doing your thang)
You were a blessing in disguise, Lord have mercy (Lord have mercy)
You're so beautiful, I love your vibe, please don't hurt me (Don't you hurt me, no)
The only one can stop the time when it's turning
Your white lighter in the air, you stand for something

[Verse 2 : Masego]
Uh, listen
Listen, listen
Don't you sway my way, you might fade away
Don't be wasting time, just gon' save the day
We make history today
You don't need another, we ain't even dating
We're just dealing with each other
I say you don't need another, we ain't even dating
We're just
You might also like[Chorus : Masego]
I don't even love you
Maybe just a little (Little, a little)
I don't even know you but
I, I, I, I feel your rhythm, your rhythm
I say I don't even love you
I don't even love you
Maybe just a little (Little, a little)
But I feel your rhythm, but I feel your rhythm

[Verse 3: De'Wayne Jackson]
You're driving way too fast for my good
And that ain't right, see, we don't drive the same
And I don't wanna play with ya
She tell me, "Take off your cool"
Well maybe you ain't cool enough
Hey, I should hide from this
I just love to be alone and vibe with this
It's a sad boy paradox, I'm high on this
Whether relying on you, on from a live with this
And I know you don't wanna hear that baby, baby
But I'm so done with you, you're crazy, crazy

[Chorus : Masego]
I don't even love you
Maybe just a little (Little, a little)
I don't even know you but
I, I, I, I feel your rhythm, your rhythm
I say I don't even love you
I don't even love you
Maybe just a little (Little, a little)
But I feel your rhythm, but I feel your rhythm
[Bridge : Masego, De' Wayne Jackson & Both]
Yeah, listen
I said, I don't know myself when I'm around you
You're to me like bees are to the flowers
You can help me but I fear your power
I'm so curious and that's the problem
I don't know myself when I'm around you
You're to me like bees are to the flowers
You can help me but I fear your power
I'm so curious and that's the problem

[Chorus : Masego]
I don't even love you
Maybe just a little (Little, a little)
I don't even know you but
I, I, I, I feel your rhythm, your rhythm
I say I don't even love you
I don't even love you
Maybe just a little (Little, a little)
But I feel your rhythm, but I feel your rhythm
