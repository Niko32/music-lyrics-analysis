Your heart's a sleeping giant worn out by someone you loved before me
I see you're scared, unconvinced by what I've tried to say;
That I am yours and that nothing will take me away

You already know but I'll sing it again:
I love you babe and nothing'll take me away
I know that you know but I'll sing it again:
I love you babe and nothing'll take me away

The way you always call me with some question, and every time
Try to pretend you didn't call me just â€™cause I was on your mind
Too soon for you to say out loud but I know
You love me and though we don't say, it already shows

You already know but I'll sing it again:
I love you babe and nothing'll take me away
I know that you know but I'll sing it again:
I love you babe and nothing'll take me away
You already know but I'll sing it again:
I love you babe and nothing'll take me away
You already know but I'll sing it again:
I love you babe and nothing'll take me away

I wait for you to open up
But it's not a bore
You're just what I've been looking for
Why do you keep your head in the sand?
Whoever you loved before me that ran nothing like me
Nothing like me
Nothing like me

I love you babe and nothing'll take me away
I know that you know but I'll sing it again:
I love you babe and nothing'll take me away
You already know but I'll sing it again:
I love you babe and nothing'll take me away
I know that you know but I'll sing it again:
I love you babe and nothing'll take me away

The way you look at me when you think I'm not looking
The way you call me up just to see what's cooking
The way you look at me when you think I'm not looking
I look at you that way too, you just don't know that I do

I know that you know
You already know
