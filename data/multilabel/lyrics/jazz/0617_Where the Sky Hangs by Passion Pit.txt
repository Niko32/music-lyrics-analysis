It goes up, it goes down
It goes any way the wind would
Like to throw it around
I was lost, now I'm found
I put my hands in the air
And my knees to the ground, yeah
The pieces of the all
That I could only hold, yeah
I could never say what you want me to say

[Refrain]
I've got somebody else
Just to keep me on my toes again
I can barely stand
When you're coming too close

[Chorus]
I get caught up in your heartstrings
Way up, where another sky hangs
I'll take all that I can get
Just don't make me go
Go,go

[Verse 2]
Was it here? Was it there?
Was it swirling around us in the atmosphere?
Is it us? Is it them?
It's the ones plucking the petals
'til we're left with the stem
The people push it forward
My body can't afford it
I step up and take it
But I fall to the side
You might also like[Refrain]
I've got somebody else
Just to keep me on my toes again
I can barely stand
When you're coming too close

[Chorus]
I get caught up in your heartstrings
Way up, where another sky hangs
I'll take all that I can get
Just don't make me go, go, go
I get caught up in your heartstrings
Way up, where another sky hangs
I'll take all that I can get
Just don't make me go,go,go

[Bridge]
Don't make me go, go
Don't make me go, go
Don't make me go, go
Don't make me go, go
What’s it cost? What’s it cost? (Hey)
The wires cross. They got crossed (Hey)
And I got lost, yeah I got lost
So what's it costing me
To get right back to you?
[Chorus]
I get caught up in your heartstrings
Way up, where another sky hangs
I'll take all that I can get
Just don't make me go, go
I get caught up in your heartstrings
Way up, where another sky hangs
I'll take all that I can get
Just don't make me go,go
