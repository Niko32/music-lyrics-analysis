These steps toward faith, I can't imagine it
Pack my suitcase up till I can't bear it
Who am I without this weight on my shoulder?
Oh God, I'm dying to know

[Chorus 1]
But how dare you want more?
How dare you want more?
Preacher, preacher's callin' from the floor

[Verse 2]
Man of secrets, two lives that he's been living in (What?)
Stolen identity, stolen dreamin'
Who is he if he just go and tell it like it is?
I'll bet he's dying to know

[Chorus 2]
But how dare you want more?
How dare you want more?
Preacher, preacher callin' from the floor (Hey)
(Hey, hеy, hey, hey, hey, hеy)
(Oh)

[Verse 3]
These steps toward faith so easy for her, but
(Out of mind, out of sight, I'm trying to find out)
Who is she without all of this carryin' fear?
Oh God, she's still my mother and still my wheel, yeah
Still my mother, still my wheel, yeah
Still my mother, still my wheel, yeah
Still my mother, still my wheel, yeah
Still my mother cryin' out

"How dare you want more?"
"How dare you want more?"
Preacher, preacher callin' from the floor
"How dare you want more?" (How dare you want more?)
"How dare you want more?"

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, lonely wants to stay forever (No)
But tonight, we're gonna do a little better (What?)
Yeah, tonight, we're gonna do a little better (Say)
Yeah, tonight, we're gonna do a little better

Wait, lonely wants to tear us down now
But tonight, we're gonna drown the sound out
Well, tonight, we're gonna drown the sound out (Hey)
Yeah, tonight, we're gonna drown it out (Yeah)

[Chorus 4]
Well, how dare you want more? (What?)
Well, how dare you want more?
(What?)

[Break]
No-no, no-no, no-no, no-no
I said, whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa, whoa-whoa (Alright)
Let's go
I said, no, hey-no, hey-no, hey-no
Get one, get two (Ah)
[Chorus 5]
