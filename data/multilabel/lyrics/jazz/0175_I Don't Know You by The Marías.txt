There’s a weight in my bed
Where you laid and you said
"I don’t know you"
"I don’t know you"
If we tried to retrace
Would it show on my face?
And remind you
I don’t mind you

[Verse 1]
And babe, this isn't right
But if you'd rather dry your eyes
Then honestly I’m fine
With keeping my trust in you
It's time to walk in my shoes, it's true
I've tried, makin' it up to you
But if I did all that I had to do
Would you be here in my room?

[Chorus]
There’s a weight in my bed
Where you laid and you said
"I don’t know you"
"I don’t know you"
If we tried to retrace
Would it show on my face?
And remind you
I don’t mind you
You might also like[Verse 2]
I may have been alright
But babe, it’s only half the time
And honestly, I’m fine
With keeping my own advice
And making up if we tried
I'm hardly unsatisfied
You’re not heels over head
But darlin'

[Chorus]
There’s a weight in my bed
Where you laid and you said
"I don’t know you"
"I don’t know you"
If we tried to retrace
Would it show on my face?
And remind you
I don’t mind you
