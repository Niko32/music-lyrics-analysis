You say it's only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make believe
If you believed in me

[Verse 2]
Yes, its only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Bridge]
Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

[Verse 3]
It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Verse 1]
You say its only a paper moon
Sailing over a cardboard sea
But it wouldn't be make believe
If you believed in me
You might also like[Verse 2]
Yes, its only a canvas sky
Hanging over a muslin tree
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Bridge]
Without your love
It's a honky tonk parade
Without your love
It's a melody played in a penny arcade

[Verse 3]
It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it can be
But it wouldn't be make-believe
If you believed in me

[Outro]
But it wouldn't be make-believe
Believe if you believed in me
