When I see you on the street
My whole body gets weak
When you're standing in a crowd
Your love talks to me so loud

[Refrain]
Girl, do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?

[Verse 2]
When I hear you on the phone
Your sweet, sexy voice turns my ear all the way on
Just the mention of your name
Seems to drive my head insane

[Refrain]
Girl, do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?
Baby

[Chorus]
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you
My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, love, love
You might also like[Verse 3]
From the time that I awake
I'm imagining the good love that we'll make
If to me your vibe can do all this
Just imagine how it's going to feel when we hug and kiss

Sugar, do I do
What you do
When I do my love to you?
Alright

[Chorus]
Yes, I got some candy kisses for your lips
Yes, I got some honeysuckle chocolate dripping kisses full of love for you

My life has been waiting for your love
My arms have been waiting for your love to arrive
My heart has been waiting
My soul anticipating your love, your love, your love

Of being part of what feels like the right romance

[Outro]
I know the record's about to end
But we're just going to play and play until it goes away
So, if you donâ€™t like the groove you can turn the record off
It won't cost you nothing but a penny and you'll have a cough
I know I cannot rhyme cause I ain't like a friend of mine
But I ha ha ha ha h-ha ha ha
