Well I know what I am
Uncertain at best
Foolish until
I came to
On an evening with you
Is it living a lie
Certain

I'm sitting in love
Talking in love
Waiting in love

Well I won't rock the boat
I don't buy just to sell
I swallow my pride
Running to
You are my moon
I will follow you down
Down Darby Creek crying

I'm running in love
Losing in love
Scratching in love
Wired in loveYou might also like
