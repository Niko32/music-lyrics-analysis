I swear, that you’ve seen me
Yes, you’ve seen me here before, before
And so don’t tell it, don’t tell it otherwise

[Verse 2]
This voice, this particular voice
Yes, you’ve heard it before, before
And so don’t you dare tell it
Don’t you dare tell it otherwise

[Chorus 1]
No wonder, why the road seems so long
Cause I had done it all before
And I won

[Verse 3]
You felt this feeling, tell me don’t be ashamed
You felt it before, before
And so don’t tell me
Don’t tell me otherwise

[Verse 4]
I almost forgot, foolish me, I almost forgot, forgot
That where I am from we see the rain
Before the rain even starts to rain
You might also like[Chorus 2]
No wonder why you’ve been buggering me
This walk, it's a previous journey
And I won

[Verse 5]
Before I was born there was a storm
Before that storm there was fire
Burning everywhere, everywhere
And everything became nothing again
And then out of nothing
Out of absolutely nothing, I, Benjamin, I was born
So that when I become someone one day
I will always remember that I came from nothing

[Chorus 3]
No wonder, why you’ve been buggering me
Cause this walk, it’s a previous journey
And no wonder why the road seems so long
Cause I had done it all before
And I won

[Refrain 1]
I’m sending my condolence
I’m sending my condolence to fear
I’m sending my condolence
I’m sending my condolence to insecurities
[Refrain 2]
You should know by now
You should know by now
That I just don’t care
For what you might say
Might bring someone downhill

[Refrain 1]
I’m sending my condolence
I’m sending my condolence to fear
I’m sending my condolence
I’m sending my condolence to insecurities
