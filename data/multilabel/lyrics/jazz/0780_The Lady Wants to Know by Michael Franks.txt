Daddy plays the ashtray
Baby starts to cry
The lady wants to know
The reason why
Daddy's just like Coltrane
Baby's just like Miles
Lady is just like heaven
When she smiles

[Chorus]
The lady wants to know
She wants to know the reason
Got to know the reason why
This man has got to go
This man is always leaving
How he hates to say goodbye
But what she doesn't know
Is there really is no reason
Really is no reason why

[Chorus]
The lady wants to know
She wants to know the reason
Got to know the reason why
This man has got to go
This man is always leaving
How he hates to say goodbye
But what she doesn't know
Is there really no reason
Really is no reason why

Daddy, he hates airplane
Baby loves to fly
The lady wants to know the reason why
Daddy's just like Coltrane
Baby's just like Miles
The lady is just like heaven
When she smiles

[Chorus]
The lady wants to know
She wants to know the reason
Got to know the reason why
This man has got to go
This man is always leaving
How he hates to say goodbye
But what she doesn't know
Is there really no reason
Really is no reason why
