I know I'd go from rags to riches
If you would only say you care
And though my pockets may be empty
I'd be a millionaire, just like Elton, haha

[Verse 2: Elton John]
My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart, I'd be king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything

[Pre-Chorus: Tony Bennett & Elton John]
So open your arms and you'll open the door
To every treasure that I'm hoping for
Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore

[Chorus: Tony Bennett, Elton John & Both]
Must I forever be a beggar
Whose golden dreams will not come true?
Or will I go from rags to riches?
My fate is up to you

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Tony Bennett, Elton John & Both]
Must I forever be a beggar
Whose golden dreams will not come true?
Or will I go from rags to riches
My fate is up to youYou might also like
