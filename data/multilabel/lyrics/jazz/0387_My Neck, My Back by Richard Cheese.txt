Do it now lick it good
Suck this pussy just like you should

[Verse 1]
All you ladies pop your pussy like this
Shake your body, don't stop, don't miss
All you ladies pop your pussy like this
Shake your body, don't stop, don't miss

[Chorus]
My neck, my back, lick my pussy and my crack
My neck (His neck), my back (His back), lick my pussy and my crack (His crack)

[Verse 2]
First you gotta put your neck into it
Don't stop, just do it, do it
Then you roll ya tongue from the crack back to the front
And then you (Suck) suck it off 'til I shake and cum, nigga
(Make) make sure I keep bustin' nuts, nigga (Face)
All over your face and stuff
Slow head show me so much love

[Chorus]
My neck (His neck), my back (His back), lick my pussy and my crack (His crack)
My neck (My neck), my back (My back), lick my pussy and my crack
Lick my pussy, Bobby!

But fuck that, nigga, get on your knees
Try me I'll make you see
Your bitches ain't got shit on me

[Chorus]
My neck (His neck), my back (His back), lick my pussy and my crack (Lick his pussy and his crack)
My neck, my back, lick my pussy and my crack
My neck (His neck), my back (His back), lick my pussy and my crack (His pussy, his crack)
My neck (His neck), my back (His back), lick my pussy and my crack
