Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window

[Verse 1: Lisa Keith]
It's just a little thing
But it means so much to me
Our bodies together
While the rain plays a melody

[Pre-Chorus: Janet Jackson and (Lisa Keith)]
Every raindrop
Makes me think of you
(Wishing you were close to me)
There is nothing that I'd rather do than

[Chorus: Janet Jackson]
Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window

[Verse 2: Lisa Keith]
When it's stormy outside
It's warm in my heart
With you in my arms
And when you're away from me
I wish it would rain
'Cause it's always the same
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Janet Jackson and (Lisa Keith)]
Every raindrop
Makes me think of you
(Wishing you were close to me)
There is nothing that I'd rather do than

[Chorus: Janet Jackson and (Lisa Keith)]
Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
(I can't believe)
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window
(On my window)

Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
(Making love)
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window
(On my window, I hear the raindrops flow)

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus: Janet Jackson and (Lisa Keith)]
Every raindrop
Makes me think of you
(Wishing you were close to me)
There is nothing that I'd rather do than
(That I'd rather do)
[Chorus: Janet Jackson and (Lisa Keith)]
Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me
(I can't believe)
And when I'm all alone
I hear the rain on my window
(On my window, I hear it)
Making love in the rain
I can't believe the joy it brings me

[Outro: Lisa Keith]
All alone, I hear the rain
My love, here comes the rain
My love, here comes the rain
My love, here comes the rain
My love, here comes the rain
