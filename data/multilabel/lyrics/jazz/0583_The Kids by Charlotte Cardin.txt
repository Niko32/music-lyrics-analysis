We're holding onto past grey, lost blue
And I hate you, you know
Wish that we could control our urges to hold each other again
But now I'm looking across lines wrote and lost
I can translate, you know
Burnt before it was lit, you found a lovely bad trip
And you ruined us, oh, you wrecked us

[Chorus]
Too bad for the kids downstairs
The constant bad luck
The place by the window
Where we used to
Your vegan trend
Your philosophy lines
You're not a friend, not this time

[Verse 2]
Still holding on
We both know you're wrong, but your face says "all good"
You've always been such a runner, thought you'd leave me sooner
But you're still down here
With the girls and the kids
And the poor and the ill
And with me, babe
With the girls and the kids
And the poor and the ill
And with me, babe
You might also like[Chorus]
Too bad for the kids downstairs
The constant bad luck
The place by the window
Where we used to
Your vegan trend
Your philosophy lines
You're not a friend

[Bridge]
And all the kids downstairs
The place by the window
Where you pulled my hair
And your vegan trend
You're not a friend, not a friend

[Outro]
Too bad for the kids downstairs, oh
The kids downstairs, ooh
Your vegan trends, oh
The kids downstairs, oh
