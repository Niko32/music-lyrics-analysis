In the afterlife
You could be headed for the serious strife
Now you make the scene all day
But tomorrow there'll be Hell to pay
In the afterlife
You could be headed for the serious strife
Now you make the scene all day
But tomorrow there'll be Hell to pay

[Verse 1: Maxwell]
People listen attentively
I mean about future calamity
I used to think the idea was obsolete
Until I heard the old man stamping his feet

[Verse 2: Maxwell]
This is a place where eternally
Fire is applied to the body
Teeth are extruded and bones are ground
And baked into cakes which are passed around

[Chorus: All]
In the afterlife
You could be headed for the serious strife
Now you make the scene all day
But tomorrow there'll be Hell to pay
You might also like[Interlude]
(Yeah!)

[Verse 3: Maxwell]
Ohhhhh
Beauty, talent, fame, money
Refinement, job skill and brain
But all the things you try to hide
Will be revealed on the other side

[Chorus: All and (Jimbo)]
In the afterlife
You could be headed for the serious strife
Now you make the scene all day (Make the furnace!)
But tomorrow there'll be Hell to pay (Yes, it is the Zippers!)

[Refrain: Maxwell]
Now the D and A and the M and the N and the A
And the T and the I-O-N
Lose your face
Lose your name
Then get fitted for a suit of flames
D and A and the M and the N and the A
And the T and the I-O-N
Lose your face
Lose your name
Then get fitted for a suit of flames
[Screams]

[Outro]
I broke the chandelier
