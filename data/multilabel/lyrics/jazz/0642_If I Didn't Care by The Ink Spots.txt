If I didn't care more than words can say
If I didn't care, would I feel this way?
If this isn't love then why do I thrill?
And what makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart stands still?

[Verse 2]
If I didn't care, would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?

[Bridge]
If I didn't care, honey child, more than words can say
If I didn't care, baby, would I feel this way?
Darlin', if this isnâ€™t love, then why do I thrill so much?
And what is it that makes my head go 'round and 'round
While my heart just stands still so much?

[Verse 3]
If I didn't care, would it be the same?
Would my every prayer begin and end with just your name?
And would I be sure that this is love beyond compare?
Would all this be true if I didn't care for you?You might also like
