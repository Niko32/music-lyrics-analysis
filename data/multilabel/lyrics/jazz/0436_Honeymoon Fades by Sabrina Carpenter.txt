I hope we stay the same, hey
Honeymoon

[Verse 1]
Unexpected, this thing that we fell into
Like, so connected
You came at a time when my heart was selective
Didn't have to choose, my love was accepted, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I'm learning you like 101
You were sent to me like a one of one
And now we're going hard, just one on one
Nobody else

[Chorus]
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope that we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
After the honeymoon fades, yeah

[Verse 2]
Now remember when we met, we was all in each other's bed
And we were spending every second we had
And now that it's official, it's hittin' a little different
What the hell we gonna do with these bags? No, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm learning you like 101
You were sent to me like a one of one
And now we're going hard, just one on one
Nobody else

[Chorus]
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope that we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades
I hope we never change
I hope we stay the same
I hope we can love through the pain
After the honeymoon fades (I hope that we)

[Post-Chorus]
(Can you feel it with me? Can you feel it with me?)
After the honeymoon fades
(Can you feel it with me? Can you feel it with me?)
(Can you feel it with me? Can you feel it with me?)
(Can you feel it with me? Can you feel it with me?)
[Bridge]
And I hope it tastes the same, mmm
Even if it's bittersweet

[Refrain]
Honeymoon fading with you (Fading with you)
Honeymoon fading with you (Fading with you)
Honeymoon fading with you (Fading with you)
Honeymoon fading, fading

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
