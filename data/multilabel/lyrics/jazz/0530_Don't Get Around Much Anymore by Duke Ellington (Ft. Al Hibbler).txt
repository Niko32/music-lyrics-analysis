Missed the Saturday dance
Heard they crowded the floor
It's awfully different without you
Don't get around much anymore

[Verse 2]
Thought I'd visit the club
Got as far as the door
I couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

[Bridge]
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease
But nevertheless, why stir up memories?

[Verse 3]
Been invited on dates
Might have gone, but what for?
I couldn't bear it without you
Don't get around much anymore

[Outro]
