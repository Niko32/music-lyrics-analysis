6:05, outside the stadium
Special delivery for Hoops McCann
Brut and charisma
Poured from the shadow where he stood
Looking good
He's a crowd pleasing man

[Verse 2]
One on one
He's schoolyard Superman
Crashing the backboard
He's Jungle Jim, again
When it's all over
We'll make some calls from my car

[Chorus]
We're a star
It's a glamour profession
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
You might also like[Verse 3]
All aboard the Carib Cannibal
Off to Barbados
Just for the ride
Jack with his radar
Stalking the dread moray eel
At the wheel
With his Eurasian bride

[Verse 4]
On the town
We dress for action
Celluloid bikers
Is Friday's theme
I drove the Chrysler
Watched from the darkness
While they danced

[Chorus]
I'm the one
It's a glamour profession
(I'm the one)
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
[Instrumental break 3:24-3:59]

[Bridge]
Hollywood
I know your middle name
Who inspires your fabled fools
That's my claim to fame

[Verse 5]
Jive Miguel
He's in from Bogota
Meet me at midnight
At Mr. Chow's
Szechuan dumplings
Now that the deal has been done

[Chorus]
I'm the one
It's a glamour profession
(I'm the one)
The L.A. concession
Local boys will spend a quarter
Just to shine the silver bowl
Living hard will take its toll
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
Illegal fun
Under the sun, boys
