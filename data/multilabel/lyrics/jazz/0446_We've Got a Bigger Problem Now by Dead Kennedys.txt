Last call for alcohol
Last call for your freedom of speech
Drink up, Happy Hour is now enforced by law
Don't forget our house special
It's called a Tricky Dicky Screwdriver
It's got one part Jack Daniels
Two parts purple Kool-Aid
And a jigger of formaldehyde
From the jar with Hitler's brain in it
We've got in the back storeroom
Happy trails to you, happy trails to you!

[Verse 1]
I am Emperor Ronald Reagan
Born again with fascist cravings
Still, you made me president
Human rights will soon go 'way
I am now your Shah today
Now I command all of you
Now you're going to pray in school
I'll make sure they're Christian, too

[Chorus]
California über alles
California über alles
Über alles California
Über alles California

Shab shabba, shabba doo-wah, yeah!

[Verse 2]
Ku Klux Klan will control you
Still, you think it's natural
Nigga knockin' for the master race
Still, you wear the happy face
You closed your eyes, can't happen here
Alexander Haig is near
Vietnam won't come back, you say
Join the Army or you will pay
Join the Army or you will pay

[Chorus]
California über alles
California über alles
Über alles California
Über alles California

[Interlude: Spoken]
Yeah, that's it, just relax
Have another drink, few more pretzels
Little more MSG
Turn on those Dallas Cowboys on your TV
Lock your doors, close your mind
It's time for the two-minute warning
[Bridge]
Welcome to 1984!
Are you ready for the Third World War?
You, too, will meet the secret police
They'll draft you and they'll jail your niece
You'll go quietly to boot camp!
They'll shoot you dead, make you a man
Don't you worry; it's for a cause
Feeding global corporations' claws
Die on our brand-new poison gas
El Salvador or Afghanistan
Making money for President Reagan
Making money for President Reagan!
And all the friends of President Reagan!

[Chorus]
California über alles
California über alles
Über alles California
Über alles California

[Outro]
Ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah
Ha, ha, ha ha!
