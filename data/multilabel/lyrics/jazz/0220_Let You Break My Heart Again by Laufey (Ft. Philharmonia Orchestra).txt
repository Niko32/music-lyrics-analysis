Feeling kind of sick tonight
All I've had is coffee and leftover pie
It's no wonder why
Still you take up all my mind
I don't even think that you care like I do
I should stop
Heaven knows I've tried

[Chorus]
One day
I will stop falling in love with you
Some day
Someone will like me like I like you
Until then I'll drink my coffee
Eat my pie
Pretend that we are more than friends
Then of course I'll let you break my heart again

[Verse 2]
I'm just tryna understand
What I am to you
More than songs we've exchanged
Midnight calls
Sunset views
Promise I don't mean to cry
But I get overwhelmed and confused
If only you knew
What I felt like
You might also like[Chorus]
One day
I will stop falling in love with you
Some day
Someone will like me like I like you
Until then I'll drink my coffee
Eat my pie
Pretend that we are more than friends
Then of course I'll let you break my heart again

[Outro]
Some day
One day
I will stop falling in love with you
Until I do
I'll be thinking of you
Let you break my heart again
