Eleven seven love, no seven-seventy, 'round the town
Press push, no transpose
Let me hear that natural tone
Find a spot to make it go
To a place you'll never go
Where you tryna go, I'm tryna go
I got the keys, you got the house
I got the vibe, you got the juice
I got the—ooh
I got the mic

[Chorus]
I had a vision, yeah
A room full of women, yeah
All of them were driven, yeah
Straight independent, yeah

[Verse 1]
French neck, but she plays like she's from Virginia
Body from the Bay and she knows the slang
Mouth piece codeine with a bunch of reefer (Ah)
Been around town, but she keep it secret

[Verse 2]
Wanna show you off, you a bad one (She bad)
Rock you on my neck, you motivate me, you're just what I need
If they snap us they gonna need a frame on deck
Basquiat soul, you're painting love the best (I'm so)
Rebellious when it come to this
(What you even mean? What you even dream?)
You might also like[Chorus]
I had a vision, yeah
A room full of women, yeah
All of them were driven, yeah
Straight independent, yeah

[Verse 2]
Got a square frame, but she deemed a legend
Hip-Hop claim she like an eleven
Take all my thoughts and my ideas
Walls so thick, call her IKEA (IKEA)
So lit when I plug in
So in sync, in sync when I'm loving (Lady Lady)
Knock and rock, call her Aaliyah, call her Aaliyah
Knock and rock, call her Aliyah
Rock the bo—shh, shut up, you can't clear that sample
Bring the chorus

[Chorus]
I had a vision, yeah
A room full of women, yeah
All of them were driven, yeah
Straight independent, yeah

[Verse 3]
Touching you is so easy
Swear it's muscle-muscle-muscle-muscle 'mory
Mix chick, and she black, white, enchanting
Lady, lady, won't you come with me?
[Outro]
Hol' up
Hit hard, hit soft (Velocity)
Turn left, turn right (Knobby knees)
Go up, go down (Variety)
Same time, same time (Melody)
Hit hard, hit soft (Velocity)
Turn left, turn right (Knobby knees)
Go up, go down (Variety)
Same time, same time (Melody)
Hit hard, hit soft (Velocity)
Turn left, turn right (Knobby knees)
Go up, go down (Variety)
Same time, same time (Melody)
