My life, my life, my life, my life
In the sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get down in the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get brown in the sunshine

[Bridge]
Just bees and things and flowers
Just bees and things and flowers
Just bees and things and flowers
Just bees and things and flowers

[Chorus]
My life, my life, my life, my life
In the sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get down in the sunshine
Sunshine, folks get brown in the sunshine

[Verse]
Feel what I feel, when I feel what I feel
When I'm feelin', in the sunshine
Feel what I feel, when I feel what I feel
When I'm feelin', in the sunshine
Do what I do, when I do what I do
When I'm doin', in the sunshine
Do what I do, when I do what I do
When I'm doin', in the sunshine
