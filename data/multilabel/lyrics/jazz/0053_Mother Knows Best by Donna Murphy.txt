You want to go outside? Why, Rapunzel...

(sung)
Look at you, as fragile as a flower
Still a little sapling, just a sprout
You know why we stay up in this tower

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
I know, but—

[MOTHER GOTHEL]
That's right, to keep you safe and sound, dear
Guess I always knew this day was coming
Knew that soon you'd want to leave the nest
Soon, but not yet

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
But—

[MOTHER GOTHEL]
Shh!
Trust me, pet
Mother knows best

Mother knows best, listen to your mother
It's a scary world out there
Mother knows best, one way or another
Something will go wrong, I swear
Ruffians, thugs, poison ivy, quicksand
Cannibals and snakes
The plague

No!

[MOTHER GOTHEL]
Yes!

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
But—

[MOTHER GOTHEL]
Also, large bugs
Men with pointy teeth, and
Stop, no more, you'll just upset me
Mother's right here, Mother will protect you
Darling, here's what I suggest
Skip the drama, stay with mama
Mother knows best

Go ahead, get trampled by a rhino
Go ahead, get mugged and left for dead
Me, I'm just your mother, what do I know?
I only bathed and changed and nursed you
Go ahead and leave me, I deserve it
Let me die alone here, be my guest
When it's too late, you'll see, just wait
Mother knows best
Mother knows best, take it from your mumsy
On your own, you won't survive
Sloppy, underdressed, immature, clumsy
Please, they'll eat you up alive
Gullible, naïve, positively grubby
Ditzy and a bit, well, hmm, vague
Plus, I believe, gettin' kinda chubby
I'm just saying 'cause I wuv you
Mother understands, Mother's here to help you
All I have is one request
(spoken)
Rapunzel?

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
Yes?

[MOTHER GOTHEL, spoken]
Don't ever ask to leave this tower again

[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
Yes, Mother

[MOTHER GOTHEL, spoken]
I love you very much, dear
[RAPUNZEL, spoken]
I love you more

[MOTHER GOTHEL, spoken]
I love you most.

(sung)
Don't forget it, you'll regret it
Mother knows best
