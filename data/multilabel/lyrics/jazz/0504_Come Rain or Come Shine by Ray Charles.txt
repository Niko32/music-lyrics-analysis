I'm gonna love you like no one's loved you
Come rain or come shine
High as a mountain, deep as a river
Come rain or come shine

[Verse]
I guess when you met me
It was just one of those things
But don't ever bet me
'Cause I'm gonna be true, well, if you let me

[Chorus]
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And wouldn't it be fine?

[Verse]
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or are we out of the money?
Yeah, but I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine

[Chorus]
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me
Come rain or come shine
Happy together, unhappy together
And wouldn't it be fine?
You might also like[Verse]
Days may be cloudy or sunny
We're in or are we out of the money?
Yeah, but I'm with you always
I'm with you rain or shine
