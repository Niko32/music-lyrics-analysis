Ey, yeah
Ah, ey

[Verse 1]
When the world looks at me
I wonder what they see
Underneath these eyes
Oh, smiles masquerade as pain
Then grow up to be shame
And leave me with a lie

[Chorus 1]
I know they, they don't see my flaws
Or these hidden scars
And all the mess I made
Oh, so don't, don't let Sunday fool ya
Here's my hallelujah
Every single day, I'm running to Your grace
Ey, ey, ey

[Verse 2]
I'm tired of this dirty heart
That keeps our worlds apart
I need Your loving fire
And even in these church clothes
I can't dress up my soul
To be free is my desire
You might also like[Chorus 2]
I'm so far from where they think I am
But when I raise my hands
I'm reaching out for life
Oh, so don't, don't let Sunday fool ya
Here's my hallelujah
Every single day, I'm running to Your grace

[Interlude with Scatting]

[Chorus 1]
I know they, they don't see my flaws
Or these hidden scars
And all the mess I made
Oh, so don't, don't let Sunday fool ya
Here's my hallelujah
Every single day, I'm running to Your grace

[Outro]
Running to Your grace
Oh, I need it everyday
