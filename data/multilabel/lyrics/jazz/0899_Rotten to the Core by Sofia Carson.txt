They say I'm trouble, they say I'm bad
They say I'm evil, that makes me glad
A dirty no-good down to the bone
Your worst nightmare can't take me home
So I've got some mischief in my blood
Can you blame me? I never got no love
They think I'm callous, a low-life hood
I feel so useless, misunderstood, hey

[Pre-Chorus]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Welcome to my wicked world
Wicked world

[Chorus]
I'm rotten to the core core, rotten to the core
I'm rotten to the core core, who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the, I'm rotten to the... core

[Interlude]
Listen up now!

[Verse 2]
Call me a schemer, call me a freak
How can you say that? I'm just unique
What, me A traitor? Ain't got your back?
Are we not friends? What's up with that?
So I'm a misfit, so I'm a flirt
I broke your heart, I made you hurt
The past is past, forgive, forget
The truth is you ain't seen nothing yet!
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Welcome to my wicked world
Wicked world

[Chorus]
I'm rotten to the core core, rotten to the core
I'm rotten to the core core, who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the, I'm rotten to the... core

[Bridge]
Original
Unusual
You can say what you want
But we will always be...(spoken)
Rotten to the core core, rotten to the core
Rotten to the core core, who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the, I'm rotten to the...

[Chorus]
I'm rotten to the core core, rotten to the core
I'm rotten to the core core, who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the, I'm rotten to the... core
