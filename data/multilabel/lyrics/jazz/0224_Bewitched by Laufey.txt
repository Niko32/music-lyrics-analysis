Wrapped me in your arms
Leaned in and whispered, "Keep me in your heart"
I'm so bewildered
What’s this new desire called?
I didn't know that much at all
'Bout love before
But now, I think I’m learning

[Chorus]
You bewitched me
From the first time that you kissed me
Waited all night
Then we ran down the street in the late London light
The world froze around us
You kissed me goodnight

[Refrain]
You bewitch me
Every damn second you're with me
I try to think straight but I'm falling so badly
I'm coming apart
You wrotе me a note, cast a spell on my hеart
And bewitched me
Bewitched me
(Hmm)

You're not even gone
I already miss you
What's going on?
I've never been through
This all-consuming fire fuming
Cursing at the moon and losing
All control and crying
'Cause I think I’m falling

[Chorus]
You bewitched me
From the first time that you kissed me
Waited all night
Then we ran down the street in the late London light
The world froze around us
You kissed me goodnight

[Refrain]
You bewitch me
Every damn second you’re with me
I try to think straight but I'm falling so badly
I’m coming apart
You wrote me a note, cast a spell on my heart
And bewitched me
Bewitched, you bewitched me
