Christmastime is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of year

[Verse 2]
Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share

[Bridge]
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there

[Verse 3]
Christmastime is here
Families drawing near
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year

Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there

[Verse 3]
Christmastime is here
Families drawing near
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
