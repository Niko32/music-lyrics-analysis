The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction
A real big spender

[Chorus]
Good looking, so refined
Say, wouldn't you like to know
What's goin' on in my mind?
So let me get right to the point:
I don't pop my cork for every man I see
Hey, big spender
Spend a little time with me

[Verse]
Wouldn't you like to have fun, fun, fun?
How's about a few laughs, laughs?
I can show you a good time
Let me show you a good time

[Pre-Chorus]
The minute you walked in the joint
I could see you were a man of distinction
A real big spender

[Chorus]
Good looking, so refined
Say, wouldn't you like to know
What's goin' on in my mind?
So let me get right to the point:
I don't pop my cork for every man I see
Hey, big spender
Hey, big spender
Hey, big spender
Spend a little time with me
You might also like[Outro]
Yes
