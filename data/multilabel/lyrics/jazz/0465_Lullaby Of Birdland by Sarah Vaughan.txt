Lullaby of Birdland that's what I
Always hear, when you sigh
Never in my wordland could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase, how I feel

[Verse 2]
Have you ever heard two turtledoves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic music we make with our lips
When we kiss

[Bridge]
And there's a weepy 'ol willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry on my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

[Verse 3]
Lullaby of Birdland, whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in Birdland high in the sky up above
All because we're in love

[Instrumental Break]

And there's a weepy 'ol willow
He really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should tell me farewell and goodbye

[Verse 3]
Lullaby of Birdland, whisper low
Kiss me sweet, and we'll go
Flying high in Birdland high in the sky up above
All because we're in love
