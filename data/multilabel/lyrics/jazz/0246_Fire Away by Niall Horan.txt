You keep saying that you're alright
But I can see it through your fake smile, you're not
There's a reservoir in your eyes
That you've been holding back a long time, what's wrong?

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, you don't have to hold it
You don't have to be afraid
You can go ahead and unload it
'Cause you know it'll be okay

[Chorus]
Fire away
Fire away

[Verse 2]
Hold me close, but at a distance
Thinkin' I don't ever listen, but I do
I know, sometimes, it gets confusin'
You might be lost, but I ain't losin' you

[Pre-Chorus]
Darling, you don't have to hold it
You don't have to be afraid
You can go ahead and unload it
'Cause you know it'll be okay
You might also like[Chorus]
Fire away, mmm
Fire away
Fire away
Fire away

[Bridge]
And I will steady your hand
When you're losin' your grip
Even if I don't understand
You can talk to me
And I will steady your hand
When you're losin' your grip
And even if I don't understand
You can talk to me

[Chorus]
Fire away
Fire away
Fire away
Fire away

[Outro]
Fire away, yeah
