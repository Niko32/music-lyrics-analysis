Create upon my flesh
Create approach upon my breath
Bring me salvation if I fear

[Chorus]
Take my freedom
Sacred love

[Verse 2]
Create upon my breath
Create reflection on my flesh
The wealth of love
Bear me a witness to the years

[Chorus]
Take my freedom
Light my freedom up
Light my freedom up
Take my freedom
For giving me a sacred love

[Verse 3]
Create upon my flesh
Create a home within my head
You might also like[Chorus]
Take my freedom
Light my freedom up
Light my freedom up
Take my freedom
For giving me a sacred love
