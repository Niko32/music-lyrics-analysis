Money

Money makes the world go around
The world go around
The world go around
Money makes the world go around
It makes the world go 'round

A mark, a yen, a buck or a pound
A buck or a pound
A buck or a pound
Is all that makes the world go around
That clinking, clanking sound
Can make the world go 'round

Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
Money money money...

If you happen to be rich
And you feel like a night's entertainment
You can pay for a gay escapade
If you happen to be rich and alone
And you need a companion
You can ring (ting-a-ling) for the maid
If you happen to be rich
And you find you are left by your lover
And you moan and you groan quite a lot
You can take it on the chin
Call a cab and begin to recover
On your 14-karat yacht! WHAT!?

The world go around
The world go around
Money makes the world go around
Of that we both are sure
*rasberry sound* on being poor!

Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money...

When you haven't any coal in the stove
And you freeze in the winter
And you curse to the wind at your fate
When you haven't any shoes on your feet
Your coat's thin as paper
And you look 30 pounds underweight
When you go to get a word of advice
From the fat little pastor
He will tell you to love evermore
But when hunger comes to rap
Rat-a-tat rat-a-tat at the window
*knock knock* (at the window)
Who's there? (hunger) oh, hunger!!
See how love flies out the door *raspberry sound*
Money makes the world go around
The world go around
The world go around
Money makes the world go 'round
The clinking, clanking sound of
Money, money, money, money
Money, money, money, money
Get a little, get a little
Money, money, money, money
Mark, a yen, a buck or a pound
That clinking, clanking, clunking sound
Is all that makes the world go 'round
It makes the world go 'round!
