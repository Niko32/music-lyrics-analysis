Don't blow me off so I can't help it
When you shy off I can't help it
And I know you know it's wrong but I'm ready
So just rid yourself of him and come get it

[Pre-Chorus: Charlotte Day Wilson]
Got you enticed from the middle
You know I'm willing and able
And I know you know it's on when you're ready
So just rid yourself of him and come get it

[Chorus: Charlotte Day Wilson]
Oooh, I see it in your eyes
In your eyes every time
(In your eyes)
Oooh, I see it in your eyes every time

[Verse 2: Charlotte Day Wilson]
I know there's something about me
That you can't wait to just tell me
And I love the way you move, it's so bashful
So just take my hand 'cause baby it's natural

[Pre-Chorus: Charlotte Day Wilson]
And I got you enticed from the middle
And I know you're willin' and able
And I know you've got someone but I'm ready
So just rid yourself of him and come get it

Oooh, I see it in your eyes
In your eyes every time
(In your eyes)
Oooh, I see it in your eyes
In your eyes every time
Oh

[Bridge: Charlotte Day Wilson]
I'll let you into my life
And I'll show you, oh, when it's right
Then I guess we can say we tried
Don't let this fall by the side

[Outro: Charlotte Day Wilson]
Cause I can't, can't leave
And I can't, can't wait
Cause I can't, can't leave
And I can't, can't wait
Cause I see it in your eyes
And I feel it every time
Cause I see it in your eyes
