Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes "ah!"
When she walks she's like a samba that
Swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes, each one she passes goes "ah!"

[Chorus]
Oh, but he watches her sadly
How can he tell her he loves her?
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he

[Verse 2]
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes he smiles
But she doesn't see

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
Oh, but he watches so sadly
How can he tell her he loves her?
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he
You might also like[Verse 2]
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes he smiles
But she doesn't see

[Outro]
She just doesn't see
No, she doesn't see
She just doesn't see no no

[Instrumental break]

[Verse 1]
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes, each one she passes goes "ah!"
When she walks she's like a samba that
Swings so cool and sways so gently
That when she passes, each one she passes goes "ah!"

[Chorus]
Oh, but he watches her sadly
How can he tell her he loves her?
Yes, he would give his heart gladly
But each day when she walks to the sea
She looks straight ahead not at he
[Verse 2]
Tall and tan and young and lovely
The girl from Ipanema goes walking
And when she passes he smiles
But she doesn't see
