You moved like honey
In my dream last night
Yeah, some old fires were burning
You came near to me
And you endeared to me
But you couldn't quite discern me

[Verse 2]
Does that scare you?
I'll let you run away
But your heart will not oblige you
You'll remember me, like a melody
Yeah, I'll haunt the world inside you

[Chorus]
And my big secret, gonna win you over
Slow like honey, heavy with mood

[Verse 3]
I'll let you see me
I'll covet your regard
I'll invade your demeanor
And you'll yield to me
Like a scent in the breeze
And you'll wonder what it is about me
You might also like[Chorus]
It's my big secret, keeping you coming
Slow like honey, heavy with mood
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, ah, yeah

[Bridge]
Though dreams can be deceiving
Like faces are to hearts
They serve for sweet relieving
When fantasy and reality lie too far apart
So I stretch myself across like a bridge
And I pull you to the edge

[Verse 4]
And stand there waiting
Trying to attain
The end to satisfy the story
Shall I release you?
Must I release you?
As I rise to meet my glory

[Chorus]
But my big secret
Gonna hover over your life
Gonna keep you reaching
When I'm gone like yesterday
When I'm high like heaven
When I'm strong like music
'Cause I'm slow like honey and heavy with mood
