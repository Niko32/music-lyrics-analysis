How do I lose out to a guy who's average at best
A face that's easy on the eyes, but a name you'll soon forget
He's just more of the same, so let me take his place
That should be me, and you know why

[Chorus]
I’ll never let you down never let you down
If you give a guy a chance
He’ll only let you down only let you down
You'd best believe, I'm your leading man

[Verse 2]
So let me tell you I can do it all, I'll walk on a wire
Anything that your heart desires
And to be frank, I'm cool like Sinatra
The kind of guy you'd take home to mama
Try me out, I swear I'll deliver
Soon you'll see in me there's a future
So pay attention, I've paid all my dues
I'm what you're looking for, nice to meet you
All the other guys they are so interchangeable
Little talent, yeah, but you know that's debatable
Toss them to the left, to the left irreplaceable
And put your money on me, I'm bankable
Don't count me out, I guarantee
That I'll make you fall in love with me
What am I doing wrong, I've waited far too long, long
You might also like[Chorus]
I’ll never let you down never let you down
If you give a guy a chance
He’ll only let you down only let you down
You'd best believe, I'm your leading man

[Post-Chorus]
You'd best believe I'm your leading man
You'd best believe I'm your leading man

[Bridge]
I've been stuck in the background
Always kept my head down
I was admiring you from afar (no more, no more)
I've been stuck in the background
Always kept my head down
I need a big break, don't you go break my heart

[Vamp]
I’ll never let you down never let you down
I’ll never let you down never let you down

[Chorus]
I’ll never let you down never let you down
If you give a guy a chance
He’ll only let you down only let you down
You'd best believe, I'm your leading man
[Post-Chorus]
You'd best believe I'm your leading man
You'd best believe I'm your leading man
