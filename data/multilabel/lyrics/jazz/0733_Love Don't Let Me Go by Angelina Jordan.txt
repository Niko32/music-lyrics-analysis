Mistakes and regrets ain't all that I have left
'Cause your touch and your scent's still on my skin
Maybe I'm a fool to erase the trace of you
There's no you, no me, at least that's how I feel

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tryna pull you close, closer to me
But it's just like tryna catch smoke

[Chorus]
Love, I really wish you had a face
Maybe I could beg for you to stay
I'm on the floor, I'm begging, oh-oh-oh
Love, don't let me go
If only I could look you in the eye
There wouldn't be no place for you to hide
I'm on the floor, I'm begging, oh-oh-oh
Love, don't let me go

[Verse 2]
If you had a heart, I could make it beat for me
If you had a soul, I know where my home would be
It's not about feeling lonely, but man, I just can't forget
And though you're not here beside me, I still see your silhouette
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I'm tryna pull you close, closer to me
But it's just like tryna catch smoke

[Chorus]
Love, I really wish you had a face
Maybe I could beg for you to stay
I'm on the floor, I'm begging, oh-oh-oh
Love, don't let me go
If only I could look you in the eye
There wouldn't be no place for you to hide
I'm on the floor, I'm begging, oh-oh-oh
Love, don't let me go

[Outro]
I'm on the floor, I'm begging, oh-oh-oh
Love, don't let me go
