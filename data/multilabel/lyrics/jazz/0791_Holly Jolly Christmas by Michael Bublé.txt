It's the best time of the year
I don't know if there'll be snow
But have a cup of cheer
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And when you walk down the street
Say Hello to friends you know
And everyone you meet

Oh, ho, the mistletoe
Is hung where you can see
Somebody waits for you
Kiss her once for me
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly
Jolly Christmas this year

[Instrumental]

Kiss her once for me
Have a holly, jolly Christmas
And in case you didn't hear
Oh by golly, have a holly
