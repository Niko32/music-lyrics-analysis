[Verse 1:]
Words
A letter and a letter on a string
Will hold forever humanity spellbound
Words
Possession of the beggar and the king
Everybody, everyday
You and I, we all can say
Words
Regarded as a complicated tool
Created by man, implicated by mankind
Words
Obsession of the genius and the fool
Everybody, everyday
Everywhere and everyway

[Chorus:]
Words!
Find them, you can use them
Say them, you can hear them
Write them, you can read them
Love them, fear them
You might also like[Verse 2:]
Words
Transmitted as we're fitted from the start
Received by all and we're sentenced to a life with
Words
Impression of the stupid and the smart
Everybody, everyday
You and I, we all can say
Words
Inside your head can come alive as they're said
Softly, loudly, modestly or proudly
Words
Expression by the living and the dead
Everybody, everyday
Everywhere and everyway
(Oh words...)

[Chorus:]
Find them, you can use them
Say them, you can hear them
Write them, you can read them
Love them, fear them

[Bridge:]
Words

Words
Transmitted as we're fitted from the start
Words
Impression of the stupid and the smart

Inside your head can come alive as they're said

Expression by the living and the dead
You talk and I talk, we talk and they talk
You talk and I talk, we talk and they talk
(Communication, communication)
You talk and I talk, we talk and they talk
(Communication, communication)
You talk and I talk, we talk and they talk
