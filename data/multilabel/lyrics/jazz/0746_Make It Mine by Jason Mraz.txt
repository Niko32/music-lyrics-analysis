Wake up everyone
How can you sleep at a time like this
Unless the dreamer is the real you
Listen to your voice
The one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue
Leap and the net will appear

[Chorus]
I don't wanna wake before
The dream is over
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I, I'll know it
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I'll make it all mine

[Verse 2]
I keep my life on a heavy rotation
Requesting that it's lifting you up
Up up and away
And over to a table at the Gratitude Café

[Bridge]
And I am finally there
And all the angels they'll be singing
Ah la la la ah la la la I la la la la love this
You might also like[Chorus]
Well, I don't wanna break before
The tour is over
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I, I will own it
I'm gonna make it mine
Yes I'll make it all mine

[Verse 3]
Timing's everything
And this time there's plenty
I am balancing
Careful and steady
And reveling in energy that everyone's emitting

[Chorus]
Well I don’t wanna wait, no more
Oh I wanna celebrate the whole world
I’m gonna make it mine
Oh yes I'm' following your joy
I’m gonna make it mine
Because I, I am open
I’m gonna make it mine
That’s why, I will show it
I’m gonna make it, all mine
Gonna make, gonna make, gonna make, gonna make, make it, make it, make it, make it mine
All mine, yes, I’ll make it all mine
