Seems to me we've reached that special day
My breathing is slowed when I'm around you, I can't help it
Feeling bliss, so pure
I know it feels like you can't put in words
That ring, it sings to me a golden tune
It glistens and shines to show the world our love is true
Today I see sound
I know it to be true, our colours blend

[Chorus]
Dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah

[Verse 2]
Your dress, it brings me to a time of class
You're so elegant, your skin is shining melanin
We are king and queen
I see the next one thousand years with you
The smiles worn by both our families
They can see the power in our new found unity
One day we'll create additions in the images of we

[Chorus]
Dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah

[Chorus]
Dah-dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
Dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah-dah
