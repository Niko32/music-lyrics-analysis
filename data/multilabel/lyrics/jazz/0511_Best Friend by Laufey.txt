It's come to my attention
That I don't show enough
Of what I think
It's only when I drink I open up
But I promise that I love you
Even with that hairdo
I'm sorry I made fun of it
It's not your fault it looks like shit (like shit)

[Pre-Chorus]
I have never tolerated someone for so long
I've never laughed so much
I haven't written a sad song

[Chorus]
There's no one else I'd rather fall asleep with
And dream with
You're my best friend in the world

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Verse 3]
When we're ninety-eight and ninety-nine (ninety-nine)
Tumbling down the stairs
You'll barely catch me in time (tumbling down)
We'll argue about what to watch on TV
Finally pick a movie then we'll fall asleep (asleep)
We'll still be a little bit strange
Some things never change
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
It's funny 'cause you drive me half-insane
A universe without you would be thoroughly mundane

[Chorus]
There's no one else I'd rather fall in love with
And that is my best friend in the world

[Outro]
You're my best friend in the world
