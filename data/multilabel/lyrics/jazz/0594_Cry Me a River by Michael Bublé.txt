Now you say you're lonely
You cried the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river
Cry me a river
I cried a river over you

[Verse 2]
And now you say you're sorry
For being so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river
Mm, cry me a river
'Cause I cried a river over you

[Bridge]
You drove me
Nearly out of my head
While you never shed a tear, babe
Remember
I remember all that you said
You told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me

[Verse 3]
And now you say you love me
Well, just to prove that you do
Why don't you cry me a river?
Cry me a river
'Cause I cried a river over you, over you
You might also like[Refrain]
You say you love me, but you lie

[Verse 4]
Now you say you love me
Well, just to prove that you do
Come on and cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you

[Outro]
I cried a river
Now you can too
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
