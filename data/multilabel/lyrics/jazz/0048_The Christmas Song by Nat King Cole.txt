Chestnuts roasting on an open fire, Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir and folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow will find it hard to sleep tonight

[Bridge]
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

[Chorus]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase to kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways, Merry Christmas to you

[Piano Solo]

[Chorus]
And so I'm offering this simple phrase to kids from one to ninety-two
