Let there be peace on earth
And let it begin with me
Let there be peace on earth
The peace that was meant to be

[Verse 1: Kim Burrell]
With God as our father
Brothers all are we
Let me walk with my brother
In perfect harmony

[Chorus: Harry Connick Jr., Kim Burrell]
Let peace begin with me
Let this be the moment now
With every step I take
Let this be my solemn vow

[Verse 2: Harry Connick Jr., Kim Burrell]
To take each moment
And live each moment
To take each moment
And live each moment
To take each moment
And live each moment
In peace eternally
Let there be peace on earth

Let there be peace on earth
Let there be peace on earth
And let it begin with me
With me
