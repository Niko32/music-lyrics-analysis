Alone together, beyond the crowd
Above the world, we’re not too proud
To cling together, we’re strong
As long as we’re together

[Verse 2]
Alone together, the blinding rain
The starless night, were not in vain
For we’re together
And what is there to fear together

[Bridge]
Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather the great unknown
If we’re alone together

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Our love is as deep as the sea
Our love is as great as a love can be
And we can weather the great unknown
If we’re alone together
Together
Together
Together aloneYou might also like
