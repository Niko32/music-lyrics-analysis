When I start to care
Then I find there is no one there
But I think of you
And I know, we are something new

[Chorus]
We get higher and higher
Crazy blue, like St. Elmo’s Fire
Loves so sharp and flat
That it’s hard to know just where you're at
Now I know I want you
I want you to be my woman
Now I know I want you
I want you to be my woman

[Verse 2]
Got the werewolf split
When the moon’s full I howl at it
But it’s mostly fake
I’m in love, with the love we make

[Chorus]
We get higher and higher
Crazy blue, like St. Elmo’s Fire
Loves so sharp and flat
That it’s hard to know just where you're at
Now I know I want you
I want you to be my woman
Now I know I want you
I want you to be my woman
You might also like[Verse 3]
When my son’s full grown
And he blows mean xylophone
You and I stay tan
In the sun down in Yucatan

[Chorus]
We get higher and higher
Crazy blue, like St. Elmo’s Fire
Loves so sharp and flat
That it’s hard to know just where you're at
Now I know I want you
I want you to be my woman
Now I know I want you
I want you to be my woman

[Outro]
When I start to care
Then I find there is no one there
But I think of you
And I know, we are something new
