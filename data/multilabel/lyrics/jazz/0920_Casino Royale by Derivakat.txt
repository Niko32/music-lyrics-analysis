Two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Pay the price, play the cards
If you deal in right, then kid, you're gonna get far
The stakes are high, give it a try
Place your bets and we'll take you for a ride

[Pre-Chorus]
Lost in the night, in the shimmering light
A palace of lies, greed in your eyes

[Chorus]
Deal into the game and you can surely win it big
It's your fate to choose, go ahead and lose your inhibitions
If you wanna play with power, then you're gambling with the king
So bet on the crown, Casino Royale, chase your ambitions

[Verse 2]
Take a chance and you can win it all (Win it all-l-l)
High risk and high reward, but it's your final call (Final call-l-l)
You can cash in now or play again (Play aga-a-ain)
It really doesn’t matter, 'cause you'll owe me in the end (Oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Heed my advice (Heed my advice), eyes on the prize (Eyes on the prize)
Rolling the dice (Rolling the dice), better luck next time (Better luck next time)
You might also like[Chorus]
Deal into the game and then the world is at your feet (At your feet)
It’s your fate to choose, go ahead and lose your inhibitions
If you wanna play with power, then you're gambling with the king (King)
So bet on the crown, Casino Royale, chase your ambitions (Woo!)

[Pre-Chorus]
The gambling begins (Gambling begins), the wheel starts to spin (Wheel starts to spin)
A house full of sins (House full of sins), but the house always wins (But the house always wins)

[Chorus]
Deal into the game and you can score on anything (Anything)
It’s your fate to choose, go ahead and lose your inhibitions
If you wanna play with power, then you're gambling with the king (King)
