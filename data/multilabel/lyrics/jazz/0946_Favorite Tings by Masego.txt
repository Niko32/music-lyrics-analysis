[Verse 1]
Listen
Raindrops and roses and whiskers and kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

[Refrain]
Oh, hey
My favorite things
These are, these are, thing, thing, things
This and That and Thing 1 and Thing 2, eh

[Verse 2]
Oh look
Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels, uh
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

[Refrain]
Yee, Hey!
My favorite things, yea!
Thing, thing, thing, thing [?]
Hey, hey
Listen

Hold up, it's the voices
Hold up, jazz me

[Outro]
Thing, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing
Thing, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing
Thing, thing, thing, thing, thing, thing
Yeah

These are a few of my favorite things
These are a few of my favorite things
These are a few of my favorite things
These are a few of my favorite things
These are a few of my favorite things
These are a few of my favorite things
