Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine
Into each heart some tears must fall
But someday the sun will shine

[Verse]
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is falling in mine

[Chorus: Ella Fitzgerald]
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much, too much is fallin' in mine
Into each heart some tears must fall
But someday the sun will shine

[Verse]
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is fallin' in mine

[Bridge: Herb Kenny (& Ella Fitzgerald)]
Into each and every life some rain has got to fall
But too much of that stuff is fallin' into mine
And into each heart some tears gotta fall
And I know that someday that sun is bound to shine
You might also like[Outro: Ella Fitzgerald]
Some folks can lose the blues in their hearts
But when I think of you, another shower starts
Into each life some rain must fall
But too much is fallin' in mine
