[Verse 1]
I'm just a gigolo (Gigolo)
And everywhere I go (Gigolo)
People know the part I'm playin' (Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo)
Pay for every dance (Gigolo)
Sellin' each romance (Gigolo)
Oh, what they sayin'? (Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo)
There'll come a day
And youth will pass away
What, what will they say about me?
When the end comes, I know
They'll say "Just a gigolo", as
Life goes on without me

[Verse 2]
I'm just a gigolo (Gigolo)
Everywhere I go (Gigolo)
People know the part I'm playin' (Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo)
Pay for every dance (Gigolo)
Sellin' each romance (Gigolo)
Oh, what they sayin'? (Gigolo, gigolo, gigolo)
And there will come a day
And youth will pass away
Loo-doo-doo-doo-dwup
What will they say about me?
When the end comes, I know
They'll say "Just a gigolo", as
Life goes on without me

[Chorus]
I ain't got nobody, oh and there's
Nobody that cares for me, there's
Nobody that cares for me
I'm so sad and lonely
Sad and lonely, sad and lonely
Won't some sweet mama
Come and take a chance with me?
'Cause I ain't so bad then

[Post-Chorus]
And I'll sing her
Sweet love songs
All of the time
She will only be
On-on-on-only be
Baldee-bozee-bop, blee-bop

I ain't got nobody, oh and there's
Nobody that cares for me, there's
Nobody that cares for me
Nobody that cares for me
Nobody that cares for me
[Chorus]
I ain't got nobody, hmm honey
Nobody that cares for me, there's
Nobody that cares for me
I'm so sad and lonely
Oh lonely, oh lonely, lonely, lonely
Won't some sweet mama
Come and rescue me?
'Cause I ain't so bad then

[Post-Chorus]
And I'll sing her
Sweet love songs
All of the time
She will only be
Only-only-only-only-only-only baby
Baby, come on, sugar, darling
I ain't got nobody really baby
