It's the first day of school
And I think I might quit
'Cause the things I've been seeing in here don't make sense
So I packed up my things
And I walked through the door
And I'm going somewhere else instead

[Verse 2]
So, I chopped down some trees
And I built a small house
And I just might be small enough to live in it
Then the rain came pouring down
And it made some cool sounds
And they'll tell you what those sounds said

[Chorus 1]
Said, "Hello" and "Goodbye,"
"Do you feel alright with the days gone by?"
I'll never waste my time, I'll never say goodbye
Yes, I will, but I won't say it tonight

[Verse 3]
So I picked a new character
And I've just chose my shirt
And I'm going to the Land of the Two Letter Words
On in up at or so, by if to of no it
It's a feeling we can't forget
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Said, "Hello" and "Goodnight," "Do you feel alright?"
"Do you remember the days gone by?"
"Do you remember the way that we dreamed we could change our lives?"
"Do you feel like changing your mind?"

[Verse 4]
It's the first day of school
And I think I might quit
'Cause the things that I'm feeling still don't make sense
And I've tried to explain
And it hurts to describe
So I'll sing this song instead

[Instrumental break]

[Chorus 3]
Hello and goodbye
Do you think I'm dying?
Do you think I'm going somewhere else this time?
Do you remember the day we pretended to be every star in the sky?

[Outro]
It's the first day of school, but I think I might quit
Gonna learn some new lessons I won't forget
Gonna write them all down
In the language of love
And I'll teach them to everyone
