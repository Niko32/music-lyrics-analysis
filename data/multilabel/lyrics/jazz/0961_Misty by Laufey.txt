Look at me
I'm as helpless as a kitten up a tree
And I feel like I’m clinging to a cloud
I can't understand
I get misty just holding your hand
Misty

[Verse 2]
Walk my way
And a thousand violins begin to play
Or it might be the sound of your, "Hello"
That music I hear
I get misty the moment you're near

[Verse 3]
Can’t you see that you're leading me on
And it's just what I want you to do?
Don't you notice how hopelessly I'm lost?
That's why I'm following you
Following you

[Verse 4]
On my own
Would I wander through this wonderland alone
Never knowing my right foot from my left
My hat from my glove?
I'm too misty and too much in love
You might also like[Outro]
Too misty and too much in love
