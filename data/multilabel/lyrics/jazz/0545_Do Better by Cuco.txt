Baby, I'm gonna do better for you
Because I love you with my heart
Sunshine, moonlight, my angel
Darling, will you take my hand and my love?

[Post-Chorus]
I want to wake up next to you
Hold you in my arms forever too

[Interlude]
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah

[Chorus]
Baby, I’m gonna do better for you
Because I love you with my heart
Sunshine, moonlight, my angel
Darling, will you take my hand and my love?
