Where there was one before
Now there are many
And as the days go by
I see them multiply
I can't eat, I can't sleep
Because I know they'll be watching me
Descending on the breeze
Their shadows keep falling down on me

[Chorus]
There's a blackbird
In my garden
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh!
There's a blackbird
In my garden
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh!

[Verse 2]
Where there was one before
Now there are many
What are they waiting for?
Food, I have not any
I can't eat, I can't sleep
Because I know they'll be watching me
With yellow eyes that see right through
I don't know what I'm supposed to do
You might also like[Chorus]
All these blackbirds
In my garden
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh!
Blackbird
In my garden
Oh-oh-oh-ooh-oh oh oh oh-oh-oh!
