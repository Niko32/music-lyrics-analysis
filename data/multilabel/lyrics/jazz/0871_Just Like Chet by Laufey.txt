In a perfect world I wouldn't have met you at all
In a perfect world I would've said “Hi” and moved on

[Chorus]
Unfortunately I don't know anything
'Bout love or its foolish tendencies
And just like Chet I tend to fall in love too easily

[Verse 2]
In a perfect world I'd live out my days by the sea
In a light blue cottage
Just the sand and ocean and me

[Chorus]
Unfortunately, I'm too romantic
Dramatic for that reality
I go ahead and just like Chet I fall in love too easily

[Bridge]
Why did you, put me through
Eleven months of “you're so pretty's”, “I miss you's”?
It's absurd, what even occurred
Between autumn and spring?
If you never loved me
You might also like[Verse 3]
In a perfect world I wouldn't have met you that night
Would've stayed with my friends and just danced 'til the morning light

[Chorus]
Unfortunately, I can't trust anybody
That tells me anything
And just like that I tend to fall a little hard a little fast
At every turn I feel a little heartbreak and a little burn
And just like Chet 
I tend to fall in love too easily
