City sidewalks, busy sidewalks, dressed in holiday style
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing, people passing, meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you hear

[Chorus]
Silver bells (Silver bells), silver bells (Silver bells)
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (Ring-a-ling), hear them ring (Hear them ring)
Soon it'll be Christmas Day

[Verse 2]
(Strings of street lights, even stop lights, blink a bright red and green)
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures
(Hear the snow crush, see the kids bunch, this is Santa's big scene)
And above all this bustle you hear

[Outro]
(Silver bells) Silver bells, (Silver bells) silver bells
It's Christmas time in the city
Ring-a-ling (Ring-a-ling), hear them ring (Hear them ring)
Soon it'll be Christmas Day
Silver bells, silver bells, silver, silver bellsYou might also like
