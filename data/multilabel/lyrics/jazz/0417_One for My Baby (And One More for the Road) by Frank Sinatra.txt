It's quarter to three
There's no one in the place, 'cept you and me
So set 'em up, Joe
I got a little story I think you should know

We're drinkin' my friend
To the end of a brief episode
Make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

[Verse 2]
I got the routine
Put another nickel in the machine
Feelin' so bad
Can't you make the music easy and sad?

I could tell you a lot
But you've gotta be true to your code
Just make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

[Bridge]
You'd never know it
But buddy, I'm a kind of poet
And I got a lot of things I'd like to say
And when I'm gloomy
Won't you listen to me
Till it's talked away?
You might also like[Verse 3]
Well, that's how it goes
And Joe, I know you're gettin' anxious to close
And thanks for the cheer
I hope you didn't mind my bending your ear

But this torch that I've found
It's gotta be drowned or it soon might explode
So make it one for my baby
And one more for the road

[Outro]
The long
It's so long
The long
Very long
