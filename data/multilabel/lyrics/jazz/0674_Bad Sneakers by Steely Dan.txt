Five names that I can hardly stand to hear
Including yours and mine
And one more chimp who isn't here
I can see the ladies talking
How the times are getting hard
And that fearsome excavation
On Magnolia Boulevard

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes I'm going insane
And I'm laughing in the frozen rain
Well I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?

[Chorus]
Bad sneakers and a piña colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend

[Verse 2]
You fellah, you tearin' up the street
You wear that white tuxedo
How you gonna beat the heat?
Do you take me for a fool?
Do you think that I don't see
That ditch out in the valley
That they're digging just for me?
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Yes I'm going insane
You know I'm laughing at the frozen rain
Well I feel like I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?

[Chorus]
Bad sneakers and piña colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend

[Instrumental Break]

[Pre-Chorus]
You know, going insane
Yes I'm laughing at the frozen rain
And I'm so alone
Honey, when they gonna send me home?

[Outro]
Bad sneakers and a piña colada, my friend
Stompin' on the avenue by Radio City with a
Transistor and a large sum of money to spend
