Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits, call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

[Verse 1]
We had a good thing going lately
Might not have always been a fairy tale
But you know and I know that they ain't real
I'll take the truth over the story

[Verse 2]
You might have tried my patience lately
But I'm not about to let us fail
I'll be the wind picking up your sail
But won't you do something for me?

[Chorus]
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits, call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

[Verse 3]
Coming and going
Inside out and back to front
All tangled and messy
That's how we've been and we'll always be
And that's alright with me
You might also like[Chorus]
Don't you tell me that it wasn't meant to be
Call it quits, call it destiny
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try

[Outro]
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try, try, try
Just because it won't come easily
Doesn't mean we shouldn't try
