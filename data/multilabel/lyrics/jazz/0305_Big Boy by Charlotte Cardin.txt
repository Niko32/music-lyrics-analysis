Maybe if I spell it out
Big boy, you'll take me out proper
You nailed my heart to your wall
You never dusted off after, oh

[Chorus]
You're making me feel, oh
Like what's real ain't real
But it's real to me, mmm

[Verse 2]
Maybe if I'm a broken wing, big boy, in my nest
You nailed my heart to your wall
And disposed of the rest of me

[Chorus]
We threw, pushed, and shoved, oh
Like what's love ain't love
But it's love to me, oh

[Bridge]
My boy is not a man yet
My boy is not a man yet
But, boy, do I love it when you kiss my neck
Oh, boy, last night was perfect
You might also like[Chorus]
You're changing your mind 'bout love
Like what's mine ain't mine
But you're mine to be

[Verse 3]
Maybe if we try again
Big boy, we could have it my way
You nailed my heart to your wall
But it was damaged anyways, oh

[Outro]
You're making me feel, oh
Like what's real ain't real
But it's real to me, oh
You're making me feel, oh
Like what's real ain't real
But it's real to me, oh
