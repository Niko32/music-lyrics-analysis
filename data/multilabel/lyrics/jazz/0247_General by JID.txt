Uh, fuckin' wisdom tooth is killin' me
Fuck, whatever—ahem

[Verse 1]
Check, anybody can see the kid got it
I see niggas ignore it so I feel a way about it
From rappin' in that truck with bolts on and rollin' blunts
Baggin' a couple bitches and fuckin' them all at once
Friday night lights, I was catchin' and droppin' punts
Thinkin' 'bout rappin', I could be J.I.D or like Chris Johnson
My thumbs keep strummin' kinda like the Mumford & Sons
Mommy went dumb when she got that call, I had got caught
Kicked out of college for tongues, niggas be talkin'
I wasn't even on camera, just hit the lick with some amateurs
Glad we did that, now I'm flyin' to Los Angeles
With a 8th in my pre-rolls, call that shit a tarantula
Tarantino on your big screen, ho
Slave man, South East Coast, J.I.D or DiCap Leo
Set it off, my big sis reminded me of Cleo
And my brothers is killers you might see on Nat Geo
You gotta chill 'cause niggas can get they cap peeled
I keep that .40 like I'm Pat Tillman
They sent my nigga up the hill, yea they jack jill'd 'em
And a million other black children, let's crack the seal, I'm spillin'
You might also like[Chorus]
Alright, I feel amazin', I can feel the haters, do some
I ain't finna fade ya, I ain't got a taser, shoot some
Niggas talkin' crazy, wipe the little baby, too funny
Pull up on ya, had a crew comin', take a deuce on ya, hold up, nigga

[Interlude]
