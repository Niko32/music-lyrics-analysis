Let there be you
Let there be me
Let there be oysters
Under the sea
Let there be wind
An occasional rain
Chile con carne
Sparkling champagne
Let there be birds
To sing in the trees
Someone to bless me
Whenever I sneeze
Let there be cuckoos
A lark and a dove
But first of all, please
Let there be love

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
Let there be cuckoos
A lark and a dove
But first of all, please
Let there be love
Mmm, love
Mmm, love
Let there be loveYou might also like
