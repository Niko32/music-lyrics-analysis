Pick yourself up
Take a deep breath
Dust yourself off
And start all over again
Nothing's impossible, I have found
For when my chin is on the ground
I pick myself up
Dust myself off
And start all over again

[Bridge]
Don't lose your confidence if you slip
Be grateful for a pleasant trip
And pick yourself up
Dust yourself off
And start over again

[Verse 2]
Work like a soul inspired
Until the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired
But you'll be a man, my son
Will you remember the famous men
Who had to fall to rise again
So take a deep breath
Pick yourself up
Dust yourself off
And start over again

[Outro]
Work like a soul inspired
'Til the battle of the day is won
You may be sick and tired
But you'll be a man, my son
Will you remember the famous men
Who had to fall to rise again?
So take a deep breath
Pick yourself up
Dust yourself off
And start all over again
