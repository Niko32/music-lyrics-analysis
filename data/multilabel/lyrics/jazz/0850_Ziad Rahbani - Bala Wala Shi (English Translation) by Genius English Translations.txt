I love you

Without a single thing...

There is no money in this love
Nor are there Lirat (Lebanese currency)
Nor are there lands
Or even any jewelry

Come, let's sit in the shade
Nobody owns this spot
Think a little, and love me

Without a single thing
You, alone

Without nothing at all

Without any type of clothes
Without any make-up
Without all of your friends
The nice and annoying ones

Come, let's sit in the shade
Nobody owns this spot
Think a little, and love me
You might also likeCome, let's sit X2

Without your mother and father's rants
And your eyelashes and mascara
Without all the women's gossip
And all of that nonsense

Come, let's sit in the shade
Nobody owns this spot
Think a little, and love me

Come, let's sit in the shade
Nobody owns this spot
Think a little, and love me

Without a single thing...
