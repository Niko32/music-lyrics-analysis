I'm Mr. King Dice, I'm the gamest in the land
I never play nice, I'm the Devil's right hand man
I can't let you pass 'cause you ain't done everything
Bring me those contracts, come on, bring 'em to the king
If you haven't finished your task, haven't worked assiduously
No, I cannot let you pass, don't you mess with me

[Chorus]
Don't mess with King Dice (Don't mess with King Dice)
Don't mess with me (Don't mess with him)
Don't mess with King Dice (Don't mess with King Dice)
Don't mess with me!

[Verse 2]
I'm Mr. King Dice, heed just what I say
The Devil has his price and I'll make sure you pay
I don't have time to mess 'round and I hope you will agree
Bring me those contracts, pronto, don't you mess with me

[Chorus]
Don't mess with King Dice (Don't mess with King Dice)
Don't mess with me (Don't mess with him)
Don't mess with King Dice (Don't mess with King Dice)
Don't mess with me!You might also like
