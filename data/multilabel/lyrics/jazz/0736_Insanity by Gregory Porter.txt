How did we ever lose our minds?
And fall apart, knowing we're the only ones
To heal each others hearts
Bring your love back to me
Stop this insanity
Before we go too far

[Verse 2]
How did we ever lose our way?
And try to say love is a losing game
Should've never tried to play
Bring your love back to me
Stop this insanity
Before we go too far

[Chorus]
We were lovers
And the best of friends
And I hope, I hope that we can be that
Until the end
Sometimes the lover
Can be angry 'till the end
But it's always the friend inside
That will make amends

How did we ever lose our way?
And try to say love is a losing game
Should've never tried to play
Bring your love back to me
Stop this insanity
Before we go too far

[Trumpet Solo]

[Chorus]
We were lovers
And the best of friends
And I know that we can be that
Be that 'till the end
Sometimes the lover
Can be angry 'till the end
But it's always the friend inside
That will make amends

[Verse 4]
How did we ever lose our way?
And start to say love is a losing game
We will never feel the same
Bring your love on back to me
Stop this insanity
Before we go too far
Before we go too far
Before we go too far
Before we go too far
