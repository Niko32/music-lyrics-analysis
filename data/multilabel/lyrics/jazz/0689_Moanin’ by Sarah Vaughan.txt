I'm alone and crying the blues
I'm so tired of paying the dues
Everybody knows I'm moanin'

Every evening I am moanin'
'Cause of all I the trouble I see
Life's a loosing gamble to me
Everybody knows I moanin'

[Chorus]
Lord, I spend many a days and nights alone with my grief
And I pray, really and truly pray
Somebody will come and bring me relief

Every mornin' finds me moanin'
I'm alone and crying the blues
I'm so tired of paying my dues
Everybody knows I'm moanin'

[Chorus]
[Repeat: x4]
Everybody knows I'm moanin'You might also like
