Oo-oo-oo, da-da-da
Doo-doo-doo-doo, la-da-da
Doo-do, doo-do-doo, do-do-oo-do
Doo-do-doo-doo-do-doo
Do-do-doo

[Verse 1]
You are the clock that wouldn't tick for me
It feels so right, but it ain't meant to
So just don't say it, just don't say anything at all
You make it, you break it, even when you fake it all

[Chorus]
Oh, you're on my mind, I'm in your shadow
Waiting patiently for a pair of big hands
To pull you next to me
It's hard to find something that gets me
Filled up and empty at the same time
At the same time

[Verse 2]
I'm falling over my own steps
They get so clumsy when you get to me
You tear me up
And I thought I knew what I was
Now I feel made up, I'm a parody
You wake me up
You might also like[Verse 3]
Oh, what you are is hard to find
You could teach the deaf or you could lead the blind
Just by the shock of your touch, yeah I know how it feels
Or the knife in your stare and the way that it peels me

[Bridge]
Over and over 'til I'm skinned to the core
I found a hole in my heart that wasn't there before
I'm just a pale little boy lookin' out for myself
But I start shaking for you and nobody else, yeah
I'd like to be just simple and dry
But it rains like a storm and I can't fight the sky
If you know what is best for your friends and yourself
You will sit still, and shut your mouth, so

Cut out your fussin' now
Cut out your fussin' now
Cut out your fussin' now
Cut out your fussin' now
Stop it with the fussin' now
Stop it with the fussin' now
Ooh, oh

[Chorus]
You're on my mind, I'm in your shadow
Waiting patiently for a pair of big hands
To pull you next to me
It's hard to find something that gets me
Filled up and empty at the same time
You're on my mind, I'm in your shadow
Waiting patiently for a pair of big hands
To pull you next to me
It's hard to find something that gets me
Filled up and empty at the same time
