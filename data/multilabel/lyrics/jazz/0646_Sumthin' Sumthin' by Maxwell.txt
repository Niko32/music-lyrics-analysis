Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
Lay back, chill within my flow
Oh-oh, oh, oh
All I wanna know is

[Chorus]
If it's cool (If it's cool)
We can do a little sumthin' sumthin'
(Do a little sumthin' sumthin')
Let me groove with you (Oh baby)
So we can kick a little sumthin' sumthin'

[Verse 1]
Even though she pays me no attention
All I wanna show is my affection
Lose myself inside her ebony
But she ain't even checking me, oh yeah

[Chorus]
If it's cool (If it's cool, baby)
We can do a little sumthin' sumthin'
(Do a little sumthin' sumthin')
Let me groove with you (Oh baby)
So we can kick a little sumthin' sumthin'

Honeydew, sugar chocolate dumplin', yeah
Sista with a certain sumthin' sumthin'
Flava with a cocoa kinda flow
Baby baby, act like you know, oh

[Bridge]
So if it's cool (If it's cool, baby)
I wanna rock with you (Oh, R-O-C-K with you, baby)
Slip you my mellow smooth (Oh yeah)
Rock you until we're blue
Only, only if it's cool

[Chorus]
If it's cool (Oh, baby)
We can do a little sumthin' sumthin'
(Do a little sumthin' sumthin', yeah)
Let me groove with you (Oh baby)
So we can kick a little sumthin' sumthin'
(Sumthin', yeah yeah, oh-whoa-whoa-whoa, yeah)

Ah baby
Oh, oh, baby, yeah
Good God almighty, swear, Lord, I love you, baby
Know when I saw you, baby, you blew my mind
[Bridge]
So if it's cool (So if it's)
I wanna rock with you (I wanna rock with you, baby)
Slip you my mellow smooth (Oh, oh oh yeah)
Rock you until we're blue
Only, only if it's cool

If it's cool
We can do a little sumthin' sumthin'
(Do a little sumthin' sumthin', yeah, yeah, yeah)
Let me groove with you (Oh baby)
So we can kick a little sumthin' sumthin' (Whoa)

Let me groove with you
So we can kick a little sumthin' sumthin'
(Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, ah)

Judging by the way you move your body, baby, no, no
You can move it too much, yeah, oh baby
