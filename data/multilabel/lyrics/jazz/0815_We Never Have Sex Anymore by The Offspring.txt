We never have sex anymore
We never roll around on the floor like we did so long ago
And you never yell at me anymore
You never want to even the score like you did so long ago
But you're still with me, so I guess I'm not complaining
And you always leave my dinner on the stove

[Chorus]
Baby, please
If you won't love me, will you hate me?
If you won't violate me
Will you at least just aggravate me?
Baby, please (We never have sex anymore)
It feels like war under the covers, one way or the other is what I say
Hey, hey, hey

[Verse 2]
We never have sex anymore
We never make love 'til we're sore like we did so long ago
We never have emotional strife
You never even threaten my life like you did so long ago
But you're still with me, so I guess I'm not complaining
And you let me drive your car when you're not home

[Chorus]
Baby, please
If you won't love me, will you hate me?
If you won't violate me
Will you at least just aggravate me?
Baby, please (We never have sex anymore)
It feels like war under the covers, one way or the other is what I say
Hey, hey, hey

We used to do it constantly
We used to have a ball
We used to do it everywhere, now
We never do it at all

[Chorus]
Baby, please
If you won't love me, will you hate me?
If you won't violate me
Will you at least just aggravate me?
Baby, please (We never have sex anymore)
It feels like war under the covers, one way or the other is what I say
Hey, hey, hey

[Outro]
We never have sex anymore, oh
We never have sex anymore, oh
We never have sex anymore, oh
We never have sex anymore, oh
