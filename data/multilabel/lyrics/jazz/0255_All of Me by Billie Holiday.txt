All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I want to lose them
Take my arms, I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on, dear, without you?
You took the part that once was my heart
So why not take all of me?

[Verse 2]
All of me, why not take all of me?
Can't you see I'm no good without you?
Take my lips, I want to lose them
Take my arms, I'll never use them
Your goodbye left me with eyes that cry
How can I go on, dear, without you?
You took the best so why not take the rest?
Baby, take all of meYou might also like
