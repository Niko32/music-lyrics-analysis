In the South Land, there's a city
Way down on the river
Where the women are very pretty
And all the men deliver
They got music, it's always playin'
Start in the day time, go all through the night
When you hear that music playin'
Hear what I'm saying and make ya feel alright

[Chorus]
Grab somebody, come on down
Bring your paintbrush, we're paintin' the town
Oh, there's some sweetness goin' 'round
Catch it down in New Orleans

[Verse 2]
We got magic, good and bad
Make you happy or make you real sad
Get everything you want or lose what you had
Down here in New Orleans

[Chorus]
Hey partner, don't be shy
Come on down here and give us a try
You wanna do some livin' before you die?
Do it down in New Orleans
You might also like[Outro]
Stately homes and mansions
Of the Sugar Barons and the Cotton Kings
Rich people, poor people, all got dreams
Dreams do come true in New Orleans
