I ain't takin' your shit today, no
I ain't takin' your shit tomorrow, no
We can do it my way, so
I ain't stickin', no
No, I ain't stickin' 'round no more
'Cause you just wanna play with my heart, and (Oh)
I seen you with the girl at the party (Oh, no)

[Pre-Chorus: Summer Walker]
You think I'm just gon' stand on by
And watch you waste my time? (No)
Boy, I am way too fine, so I'm out (No)

[Chorus: Summer Walker]
I guess I'm unloyal, baby
I guess I'm untrue (Yeah, yeah)
I guess I'm unloyal, baby (Look)
We'll call it what you want
I guess I'm unloyal, baby (Baby)
I guess I'm untrue, oh
Guess I'm unloyal, baby (Baby)
Oh, so call me what you want

[Verse 2: Summer Walker]
You think that I need you? Boy, you funny
Got my own money, so I'ma show you
Ayy, you swear that I'll be lonely
Guess you don't know me
Guess you don't know

[Verse 3: Ari Lennox]
I said you can come and pick up your shit (No)
Actin' like you payin' for shit (Broke)
With your Bow Wow durag
Outside with your doggy bag
Bitch, I am so done with that
Tell me how a grown man so childish
Always in Kevin Samuels' comments

[Pre-Chorus: Ari Lennox]
You think I'm just gon' stand on by
And watch you waste my time?
Boy, I am too damn fine, baby

[Chorus: Ari Lennox]
Guess I'm unloyal, baby

Guess I'm unloyal, baby
Call it what you want
Guess I'm unloyal, baby
