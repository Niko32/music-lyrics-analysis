Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old Pharaoh to
Let my people go

[Verse 1]
When Israel was in Egypt's land
Let my people go
Oppress'd so hard they could not stand
Let my people go

[Chorus]
So the Lord said:
“Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old Pharaoh to
Let my people go”

[Verse 2]
So Moses went to Egypt's land
Let my people go
He made old Pharaoh understand
Let my people go

[Chorus]
Yes, the Lord said:
“Go down, Moses
Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old Pharaoh to
Let my people go”

Way down in Egypt's land
Tell old Pharaoh to
Let my people go”

Tell old Pharaoh to
Let my people go
