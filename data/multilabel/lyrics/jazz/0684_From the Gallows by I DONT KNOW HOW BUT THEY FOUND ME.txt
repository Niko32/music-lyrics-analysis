You're beautiful and evil, too
Sinister and vile
For you, I'd die, or kill myself
Whichever makes you smile

[Chorus]
And if I succeed, I'll count all your teeth
I'd swing from the gallows and wave
And there, from the noose, lest you're cuttin' me loose
I'd carousel into my grave
[Verse 2]
Darling, Lord knows you're beautiful
But you're evil
Fact is, you're down right vicious, too
But each night I look up at the stars in the sky
And I can't help it
But I still wish I was with you

[Chorus]
And if I succeed, I'll count all your teeth
I'd swing from the gallows and wave
And there, from the noose, lest you're cuttin' me loose
I'd carousel into my graveYou might also like
