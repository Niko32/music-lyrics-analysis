I don't feel a thing
And I stopped remembering
The days are just like moments turned to hours
Mother used to say
"If you want, you'll find a way"
But mother never danced through fire shower

[Chorus]
Walk in the rain, in the rain, in the rain
I walk in the rain, in the rain
Is it right or is it wrong?
And is it here that I belong?

[Verse 2]
I don't hear a sound
Silent faces in the ground
The quiet screams, but I refuse to listen
If there is a Hell
I'm sure this is how it smells
Wish this were a dream, but no, it isn't

[Chorus]
Walk in the rain, in the rain, in the rain
I walk in the rain, in the rain
Am I right or am I wrong?
And is it here that I belong?

[Chorus]
Walk in the rain, in the rain, in the rain
I walk in the rain, in the rain
Why do I feel so alone?
For some reason I think of home
