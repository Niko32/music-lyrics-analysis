Those fingers in my hair
That sly come-hither stare
That strips my conscience bare
It's witchcraft
And I've got no defense for it
The heat is too intense for it
What good would common sense for it do?

[Chorus 1]
'Cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
And although I know it's strictly taboo
When you arouse the need in me
My heart says "Yes, indeed" in me
"Proceed with what you're leadin' me to"

[Post-Chorus 1]
It's such an ancient pitch
But one I wouldn't switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you

[Chorus 2]
'Cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft
And although I know it's strictly taboo
When you arouse the need in me
My heart says "Yes, indeed" in me
"Proceed with what you're leadin' me to"
You might also like[Post-Chorus 2]
It's such an ancient pitch
But one that I'd never switch
'Cause there's no nicer witch than you
