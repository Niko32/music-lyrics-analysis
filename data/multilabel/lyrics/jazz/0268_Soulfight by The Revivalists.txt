[Verse 1]
Well isn't anybody home in here?
It's getting cold and I just don't care
So I'm gonna find something else to do, uh-huh
Just take a really good look at me
I'm 22 and I still don't see, why
All of you people just can't get along, anymore
'Cause fallin' down ain't so hard to do
Your only crutch be the bottle of brew
So I'm gonna find something else to do, uh-huh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if I ever was say to you
All of them things that you wanted me to, love
I'd have to find something else to do, uh-huh

[Chorus]
So I'm gonna stand here by your fire
'Cause it's a cold one tonight
I'm taking care of soulfight
And you're the reason why
Well I don't ask questions and I don't tell no lies
It's the reason why
I'm taking care of soulfight
And you're the reason why

Oh my God I almost died last night
Wrecked my car then I totalled my life
So I'm gonna find something else to do, ah-huh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause if I ever was say to you
All of the things that you wanted me to, love
I'd have to find something else to do, ah-huh

[Chorus]
So I'm gonna stand here by your fire
'Cause it's a cold one tonight
I'm taking care of soulfight, Babe
And you're the reason why
Well I don't ask questions and I don't tell no lies
It's the reason why
I'm taking care of soulfight
And you're the reason why
Well you're the reason why
Oh you're the reason why
Oh you're the reason why

[Bridge]
So Mother Mary won't you come sing a song for me?
And make it last all damn night
'Cause you know I can't hang on to see
When this noose pulls me so tight
Well I would scratch and bleed from my fingernails
'Til every bit of me was gone
'Cause I didn't want her
And I didn't need her
So now I leave it alone
[Chorus]
Whooah, so I'm gonna stand here by your fire
'Cause it's a cold one tonight
I'm taking care of soulfight
And you're the reason why
Well I don't ask questions and I don't tell no lies
And that's the reason why
I'm taking care of soulfight
And you're the reason why
Well you're the reason why
Well you're the reason why
Well you're the reason why
Ah-huh

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh
So I'm gonna stand here by your fire
'Cause it's a cold one tonight
I'm taking care of soulfight
And you're the reason why
