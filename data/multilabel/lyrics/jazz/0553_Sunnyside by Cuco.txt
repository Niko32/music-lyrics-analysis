Every time I look for you
You're nowhere near, it makes me blue
I swear I need you by my side right now
Forever, baby
Every time I look for you
You're nowhere near, it makes me blue
I swear I need you by my side right now
Forever

[Verse 1]
I'm glad that I found you, but where did I go?
Why does it matter? Nobody knows
I'm looking for someone, but she isn't here
Yeah, she's an angel, she's nowhere near
Stepped below the surface, tryna find my way out
But even if I make it through, there's no one around
I thought that I saw you, you never let go
This world got the best of us, what do you know

[Chorus]
Every time I look for you
You're nowhere near, it makes me blue
I swear I need you by my side right now
Forever, baby
Every time I look for you
You're nowhere near, it makes me blue
I swear I need you by my side right now
Forever
