All the stars may shine bright
All the clouds may be white
But when you smile
Oh, how I feel so good
That I can hardly wait
To hold you
Enfold you
Never enough
Render your heart to me

All mine

[Verse 2]
From that cloud number nine

And such sad regrets
Oh, as those starry skies
As they swiftly fall
Make no mistake
You shan't escape
Tethered and tied
There's nowhere to hide from me
You might also like[Hook]
All mine
You have to be

[Bridge]
So don't resist
We shall exist
Until the day
Until the day I die

[Hook]
All mine
You have to be
