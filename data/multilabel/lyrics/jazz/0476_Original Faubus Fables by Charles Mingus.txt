Whoo! Thank you, ladies and gentlemen
Remember, no applause, and keep it down
Your drinks, don't rattle ice in your glasses
And don't ring the cash register
You got it covered?
Alright
We'd like to, um, continue this, continue this
Continue this set with a composition
Dedicated to the first, or second or third, all-American heel, Faubus
And it's titled "Fables of Faubus"

[Verse 1]
Oh, Lord, don't let 'em shoot us
Oh, Lord, don't let 'em stab us
Oh, Lord, don't let 'em tar and feather us
Oh, Lord, no more swastikas
Yee-oh

[Verse 2]
Oh, Lord, no more Ku Klux Klan

[Chorus]
Name me someone who's ridiculous, Dannie
Governor Faubus!
Why is he so sick and ridiculous?
He won't permit us in his schools!
Then he's a fool!
Oh, boo!

Boo! Nazi Fascist supremists!
Boo! Ku Klux Klan (With your Jim Crow plan)

[Chorus]
Name me a handful that's ridiculous, Dannie Richmond
Bilbo, Thomas, Faubus, Russel, Rockefeller, Byrd, Eisenhower!
Why are they so sick and ridiculous?
Two, four, six, eight:
They brainwash and teach you hate!
H-E-L-L-O, hello

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
Boo! Nazi Fascist supremists!
Boo! Ku Klux Klan with your Jim Crow plan

[Chorus]
Name me a handful that's ridiculous, Dannie
Bilbo, Thomas, Faubus, Russel, Rockefeller, Byrd, Eisenhower
Why are they so sick and ridiculous, Dannie?
Two, four, six, eight:
They brainwash and teach you hate
