I love the lie and lie the love
A-hangin' on, we push and shove
Possession is the motivation
That is hangin' up the God-damn nation
Looks like we always end up in a rut (Everybody now!)
Tryin' to make it real, compared to what? (C'mon baby!)

[Verse 2]
Slaughterhouse is killin' hogs
Twisted children are killin' frogs
Poor dumb rednecks rollin' logs
Tired old lady kissin' dogs
I hate the human, love that stinking mutt (I can't use it!)
Try to make it real, compared to what? (C'mon baby now!)

[Verse 3]
The President, he's got his war
Folks don't know just what it's for
Nobody gives us rhyme or reason
Have one doubt, they call it treason
We're chicken-feathers, all without one nut. God damn it!
Tryin' to make it real, compared to what? (Sock it to me)

[Verse 4]
Church on Sunday, sleep and nod
Tryin' to duck the wrath of God
Preachers fillin' us with fright
They all tryin' to teach us what they think is right
They really got to be some kind of nut (I can't use it!)
Tryin' to make it real, compared to what?

Where's that bee and where's that honey?
Where's my God and where's my money?
Unreal values, crass distortion
Unwed mothers need abortion
Kind of brings to mind ol' young King Tut (He did it now)
Tried to make it real, compared to what?

[Outro]
Tryin' to make it real, compared to what?
