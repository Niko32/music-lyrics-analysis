Happened by chance or design
The perfume she wore
Took me back through a door
I had closed long ago

Suddenly
I thought it was you
Thought it was you
Thought it was you
Thought it was you
Remember what we knew
I thought it was you
Thought it was you
Thought it was you
Remember when I thought it was you

We were young love was new
Warm as the sun shining through
In your arms it seemed
I went back to a dream
I had seen long ago

Suddenly
I thought it was you
Thought it was you
Thought it was you
Thought it was you
Remember what we knew
I thought it was you
Thought it was you
Thought it was you
Remember when I thought it was youYou might also like
