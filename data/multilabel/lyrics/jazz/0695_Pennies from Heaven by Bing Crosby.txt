A million years BC
The best things in life
Were absolutely free
But no one appreciated
A sky that was always blue
And no one congratulated
A moon that was always new
So it was planned that they would vanish now and them
And you must pay before you get them back again
That's what storms were made for
And you shouldn't be afraid for
Every time it rains it rains
Pennies from heaven
Don't you know each cloud contains
Pennies from heaven
You'll find yor fortune falling
All over town
Be sure that your umbrella is upside down
Trade them for a package of sunshine and flowers
If you want the things you love
You must have showers
So when you hear it thunder
Don't run under a tree
There'll be pennies from heaven for you and meYou might also like
