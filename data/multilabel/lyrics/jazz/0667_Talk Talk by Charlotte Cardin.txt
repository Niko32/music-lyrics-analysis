I don't want to be the one to kiss and tell
We both know, you're hot and high
And I want to be the one, so might as well
And I think that ass can't lie

[Chorus]
Now I can't brush off
All the talk talk shit they talk
And they say
You talk about me
Now I can't brush off
All the talk talk shit they talk
And they say
That you might like me
And they say
That you might like me

[Verse 2]
I know that you see me walking in again
It's okay, pretend otherwise
And I know that we won't end up just being friends
I look up you look down into my eyes

[Chorus]
Now I can't brush off
All the talk talk shit they talk
And they say
You talk about me
Now I can't brush off
All the talk talk shit they talk
And they say
That you might like me
You might also like[Bridge]
They talk talk
They talk talk
Talk talk shit they talk
And you got got
You got got
You got hit you got
They talk talk
They talk talk
Talk talk shy they talk
And you got got
You got got
You got hit you got
Now I can't brush off
All the talk
And they say
You talk about me

[Chorus]
Now I can't brush off
All the talk talk shit they talk
And they say
You talk about me
Now I can't brush off
All the talk talk shit they talk
And they say
That you might like me
And they say
That you might like me
And they say
That you might like me
