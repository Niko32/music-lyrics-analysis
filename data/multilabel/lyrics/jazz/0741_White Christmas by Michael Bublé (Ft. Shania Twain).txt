I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Verse 2: Michael Bublé]
Said I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days
Be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Verse 3: Shania Twain]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Mmm, where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

[Bridge: Michael Bublé & Shania Twain]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write

[Verse 4: Shania Twain]
May your days, may your days, may your days
Be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Outro: Michael Bublé & Shania Twain]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
