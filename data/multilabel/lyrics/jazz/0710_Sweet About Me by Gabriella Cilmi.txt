Ooh, watching me
Hanging by a string this time
Don't easily
The climax of a perfect lie
Ooh, watching me
Hanging by a string this time
Don't easily
A smile worth a hundred lies

[Pre-Chorus]
If there's lessons to be learned
I'd rather get my jamming words in first, oh
Tell ya something that I've found
That the world's a better place
When it's upside down, boy
If there's lessons to be learned
I'd rather get my jamming words in first, oh
When you're playing with desire
Don't come running to my place when it burns like fire, boy

[Chorus]
Sweet about me
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me
Nothing sweet about me, yeah

Blue, blue, blue
Waves, they crash
As time goes by
So hard to catch
And too, too smooth
Ain't all that
Why don't you ride
My side of the tracks?

[Pre-Chorus]
If there's lessons to be learned
I'd rather get my jamming words in first, oh
Tell ya something that I've found
That the world's a better place
When it's upside down, boy
If there's lessons to be learned
I'd rather get my jamming words in first, oh
When you're playing with desire
Don't come running to my place when it burns like fire, boy

[Chorus]
Sweet about me
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
[Outro]
Sweet about me
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
Sweet about me
Nothing sweet about me, yeah
