Uptown
It's murder out in the street
Uptown
It's murder out in the street
That's where I found my mandarin plum
That's where you'd be if you found one

[Chorus: Fagen]
Where the nights are bright
And joy is complete
Keep my squeeze on Green Flower Street

[Verse 2: Fagen]
Since May
There's trouble most every night
Since May
There's trouble most every night
(Trouble every night)
Where once we danced our sweet routine
It reeks of wine and kerosene

[Chorus]
Where the nights are bright
And joy is complete
Keep my squeeze on Green Flower Street
You might also like[Bridge]
There's a special place for lovers
One we understand
There where neon bends in daylight sky
In that sunny room she soothes me
Cools me with her fan
We're drifting
A thousand years roll by

[Verse 3]
Lou Chang
Her brother he's burning with rage
Lou Chang
Her brother he's burning with rage
(Lou Chang burns with rage)
I'd like to know what's on his mind
He says hey buddy you're not my kind

[Chorus]
Where the nights are bright
And joy is complete
Keep my squeeze on Green Flower Street
