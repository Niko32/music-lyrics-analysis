It was fascination, I know
And it might have ended
Right then, at the start
Just a passing glance
Just a brief romance
And I might have gone on my way
Empty-hearted
It was fascination, I know
Seeing you alone with the moonlight above
Then I touch your hand
And next moment I kiss you
Fascination turned to love

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro]
It was fascination, I know
Seeing you alone with the moonlight above
Then I touch your hand
And next moment I kiss you
Fascination turned to loveYou might also like
