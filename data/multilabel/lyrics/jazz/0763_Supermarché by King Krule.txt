Bleeding into the brains of
Your cat, small fish, dog
She lays at night
(Right by the speeding light)
Seeping through the bolts and cogs
Of these machines of fog
That we sit inside
(They sit inside)
Young man turnin' in on himself
Felt the horror through her

[Chorus]
Let go
Let go
Let go
Another pair of eyes
Let go
To see they sacrifices

[Verse 2]
He's creepin' 'round the aisles of
The supermarket mall
(Shut the door, shut the)
(Let them burn, it sets you free)
Freeing from the battlefields
Young children with shields
You might also like[Chorus]
Of love
Of love

[Outro]
We have to rise above
(Enough's enough's enough's enough)
(Enough's enough's enough)
(Enough's enough's enough's enough)
(Enough's enough, enough's enough)
What's your worth?
(Hahaha, fuck all that, man)
