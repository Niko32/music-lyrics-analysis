Orpheus, my heart is yours
Always was and will be
It’s my gut I can’t ignore
Orpheus, I’m hungry
Oh, my heart, it aches to stay
But the flesh will have its way
Oh, the way is dark and long
But I’m already gone...

(spoken)
I’m gone

[FATES]
Go ahead and lay the blame
Talk of virtue
Talk of sin
Wouldn’t you have done the same?
In her shoes
In her skin?
You can have your principles
When you’ve got a bellyful
But hunger has a way with you
There’s no telling what you’re gonna do
When the chips are down
Now that the chips are down
What you gonna do when the chips are down?
Now that the chips are downYou might also like
