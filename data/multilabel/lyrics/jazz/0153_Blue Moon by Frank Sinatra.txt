Blue moon
You saw me standin' alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

[Verse 2]
Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me sayin' a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

[Bridge]
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will hold
I heard somebody whisper, "Please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold

[Verse 3]
Blue moon
Now, I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own

[Bridge]
And then there suddenly appeared before me
The only one my arms will ever hold
I heard somebody whisper, "Please adore me"
And when I looked, the moon had turned to gold

Blue moon
Now, I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
[Outro]
Blue moon
Now, I'm no longer alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own
