I just met you
It seems like yesterday
You opened up your eyes
And I recognized your face
You know that you're the one that we've been waiting for
We're gonna keep you safe
First time I held you in my arms
I knew I'd love you all the way

[Verse 2]
I tuck you in at night
Another day has passed
Every week goes by a little faster than the last
It wasn't so long ago
We walked together and you held my hand
And now you're getting too big to want to
But I hope you'll always understand

[Chorus]
That I'm always gonna lift you up
And I'm never gonna let you down
No matter what you do
I'm forever proud of you
I love you forever now

Through your ears I hear it
Through your eyes I see
A world full of magic
Full of possibilities
You know as well as anybody how tough this life can be
But you've got so much strength inside you
A strengh I pray you'll never need

[Chorus]
And I'm always gonna lift you up
And I'm never gonna let you down
Time flies by
I hope you realize that I
Love you forever now

[Bridge]
I'm always gonna be right here
I'll always gonna cheer you up
I'm always gonna have your back
You're never gonna be alone

[Chorus]
And I'm always gonna lift you up
No, I'm never gonna let you down
No matter what you do
I'm forever proud of you
I love you forever now
[Outro]
I love you forever now
