No!

[Verse 1]
This man is a ticket for a ghost train
I believed what he said, but I’ll never do it once again
Mama told me to resist my heartache
But nothing can stop me from goin’ insane
He’s calling me, sayin’, "My babygirl"
While he’s in bed with another chick in his rose-colored world

[Pre Chorus]
I want to choke him
Want to maltreat him
I want to squeeze him
And break his neck, neck, neck, neck

[Chorus]
I say, oh, I, I got nothing but a heartache
And I just wanna let you know that I’m
About to go insane, you know that I will soon take
My gun, my gun to shoot him down

[Verse 2]
This man is a ticket for a heartache
I want to break him bone for bone, want to stab him all night long
With a needle, nothing but my heart aches
I mean it when I say, get that jerk out of my way
You might also like[Pre Chorus]
I want to choke him
Want to maltreat him
I want to squeeze him
And break his neck, neck, neck, neck

[Chorus]
I say, oh, I, I got nothing but a heartache
And I just wanna let you know that I’m
About to go insane, you know that I will soon take
My gun, my gun to shoot him

[Chorus]
Oh, I, I got nothing but a heartache
And I just wanna let you know that I’m
About to go insane, you know that I will soon take
My gun, my gun to shoot him down

[Verse 3]
Eye for eye and tooth for tooth
You try to melt my heart, let loose
Baby boy, don’t wait for me
My kiss will hit you dangerously
Night for night, I cried and said
To myself, "He’s there for me"
Honestly, I do believe
He is nothing but a joke
[Pre Chorus]
I choke him
Want to maltreat him
I want to squeeze him
And break his neck, neck, neck, neck

[Chorus]
I say, oh, I, I got nothing but a heartache
And I just wanna let you know that I’m
About to go insane, you know that I will soon take
My gun, my gun to shoot him down

[Outro]
Someone please call 911
I‘m about to shoot him, to shoot him down, down
Will someone please call 911
I‘m about to shoot this rekcufrehtom down
