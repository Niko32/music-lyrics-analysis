(He-he-he-he, so where you gon' go with that?)
"How you doing, Miss Johnson?"
"How you doing, baby?"
"Fat ol' ass, eh"
"Oh my gosh. Why would you—Why would you say that?
I got a son, I have a s—"
"I want that"
"I got a son, Charlie"
"I know you got a son
Listen:
[Chorus: Masego & Ms. Johnson]
I need me a sugar momma, old lady
Foxy mama, sophisticated
Sugar mama, old lady
Foxy mama, sophisticated
Old age don't mean nothin' to me
Wise man said “age ain't nothin' but a number”
(Why would you say that?)

[Verse 1: Masego]
(Young gal) She don't get my jokes or my references
(Old lady) She ain't with the tech or the messages
(Young gal) Love dance, gettin' sorta decadent, ah
(Old lady) Tied up, she ain't even stressin' kids
If you can’t cook me a plate (Woah) after we mate
That ain't a date, I ain't ya man
You don't know your body yet
You don't know your body yet

I need me a sugar momma, old lady
Foxy mama, sophisticated
Sugar mama, old lady
Foxy mama, sophisticated
Old age don't mean nothin' to me
Wise man said “age ain't nothin' but a number”
(He-he-he, lemme holla at you for a second)

[Verse 2: SiR]
Little baby, little heart, I break it (Heart, I break it)
I'm chasin' me a Sanaa Lathan (Sanaa Lathan)
She payin' for the wine dine
Ain't worried 'bout my time
Might even deny my stayin' overnight
I'm sayin', I'm just fly by baggin' (Fly by baggin')
I’ll take what she supply my favorite (My favorite)
Any time I see my line start ringin'
For some part time lovin'
From the heart I'm bringing
(Young girls) She ain't even got that arch in her back
(Old ladies) Treat her special cause she know how to act
(Young girls) Never dove in an ocean so blue
(Old ladies) She's just here for the view

[Chorus: SiR & Ms. Johnson]
And I need me a sugar momma, old lady
Foxy mama, sophisticated
Sugar mama, old lady
Foxy mama, sophisticated
Old age don't mean nothin' to me
Wise man said “age ain't nothin' but a number”
(Why would you say that?)
