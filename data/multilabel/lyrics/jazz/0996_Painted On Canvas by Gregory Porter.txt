We are like children, we're painted on canvases
Picking up shades as we go
We start off with gesso
Brushed on by people we know
Watch your technique as you go

[Chorus]
Step back and admire my view
Can I use the colors I choose?
Do I have some say what you use?
Can I get some greens and some blues?

[Verse 2]
We're made by the pigment of paint that is put upon
Our stories are told by our hues
Like Motley and Bearden
These masters of peace and life
Layers of colors and time

[Chorus]
Step back and admire my view
Can I use the colors I choose?
Do I have some say what you use?
Can I get some greens with my blues?
We're just like children, we're painted on canvases
You might also like[Verse 3]
We are like children, we're painted on canvases
Picking up shades as we go
We start off with gesso
Brushed on by people we know
Watch your technique as you go

[Chorus]
Step back and admire my view
Can I use the colors I choose?
Do I have some say what you use?
Can I get some greens and some blues?

[Verse 4]
We're made by the pigment of paint that is put upon
Our stories are told by our hues
Like Motley and Bearden
These masters of peace and life
Layers of colors and time

[Chorus]
Step back and admire my view
Can I use the colors I choose?
Do I have some say what you use?
Can I get some greens and some blues?
[Outro]
We are just like children
Woah, we are just like children
We're just like children, we're painted on canvases
Admire my view
Admire my view
We're just like children, like children, like children, like children, like children
