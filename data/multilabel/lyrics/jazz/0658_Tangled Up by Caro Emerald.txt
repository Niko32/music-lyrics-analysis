(One, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
I took the perfect avenue
Down the road to both of you
Did I go Dutch? This is too much
With all the money in the world
You could never buy this girl
Quite enough, it will be tough

[Pre-Chorus]
If romancing me with neons is something you should do
Make the letters bright and luminous and blue

[Chorus]
And get me waking up, shake it up, tangled up
You could be quaking up, making up, tangled up
You can't be faking it, making it for my love
Before it's tragedy, don't get me tangled up

[Post-Chorus]
(One, two, three)

[Verse 2]
I can't separate your sins
To me you're acting like you're twins
This is a mess, is this a test?
How many guesses do I get
Till only one of you is left?
You're quite the same, if love's the game
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I want to see emotions coloring the sky
To the point it would make me wanna cry

[Chorus]
And get me waking up, shake it up, tangled up
You could be quaking up, making up, tangled up
You can't be faking it, making it for my love
Before it's tragedy, don't get me tangled up

[Post-Chorus]
Tangled up

[Bridge]
Treating girls like a yo-yo
Is a no-no of a monumental kind
If playing with your string happens to be your thing
It's easy to say to both, "Oh, never mind"

[Chorus]
And get me waking up, shake it up, tangled up
You could be quaking up, making up, tangled up
You can't be faking it, making it for my love
Before it's tragedy, don't get me tangled up

[Outro]
Mm-mm, oh-oh-oh-oh, tangled up
Mm-mm, oh-oh-oh-oh, tangled up
Mm-mm, oh-oh-oh-oh, tangled up
Mm-mm, oh-oh-oh-oh, tangled up
