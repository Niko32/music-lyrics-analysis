I got me ten fine toes to wiggle in the sand
Lots of idle fingers snap to my command
A lovely pair of heels that kick to beat the band
Contemplating, nature can be fascinating
Add to these a nose that I can thumb
And a mouth by gum have I
To tell the whole darn world
If you don't happen to like it, deal me out
Thank you, kindly pass me by

[Refrain]
Pass me by, pass me by
If you don't happen to like it, pass me by

[Bridge]
Lots of idle fingers snap to my command

Contemplating, nature can be fascinating

I'll tell the whole darn world
If you don't happen to like it, deal me out
Thank you, kindly pass me by

[Refrain]
Pass me by, pass me by
If you don't happen to like it pass me by

I got me ten fine toes to wiggle in the sand
Lots of idle fingers snap to my command
A lovely pair of heels that kick to beat the band
Contemplating, nature can be fascinating
Add to these a nose that I can thumb
And a mouth by gum have I
To tell the whole darn world
If you don't happen to like it, deal me out
Thank you, kindly pass me by

[Outro]
Pass me by, pass me by
If you don't happen to like it, pass me by
