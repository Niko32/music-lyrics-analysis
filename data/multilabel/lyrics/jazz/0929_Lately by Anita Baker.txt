[Verse 1:]
I can't imagine life
Without you by my side
This is love that I'm feeling
I'm hoping you're feeling the same
Things tend to slip my mind
Like how you love to wine and dine me, baby
(I know romance is important)
Important to the way that we feel

[Chorus]
Have I told you I love you lately?
Have I told you that you mean the world to me lately?
Have I told you I love you?
I'll be your wishing well
Tell me what you want

[Verse 2:]
Don't you think twice about my love
I say these things because
Because I love you baby
But it's hard to explain
I'm hoping you feeling the same
You know all that I feel inside
Verbally, I tend to hide, baby baby
Sometimes I tend to forget
How much L-O-V-E really means
You might also like[Chorus]
Have I told you I love you lately?
Have I told you that you mean the world to me lately?
Have I told you I love you?
I'll be your wishing well
Tell me what you want

[Bridge:]
You try your hardest to deal, my baby
But I forgot about... I just forgot how I feel
Things slip my mind, oh, and that's a fact
Tell me that you love me
Watch me tell you right back

[Chorus]
Have I told you I love you lately?
Have I told you that you mean the world to me lately?
Have I told you I love you?
I'll be your wishing well
Tell me what you want
