Now I'm the king of the swingers
Oh, the jungle VIP
I've reached the top and had to stop
And that's what's botherin' me
I wanna be a man, mancub
And stroll right into town
And be just like the other men
I'm tired of monkeyin' around!

[Chorus]
Oh, oobee doo
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you, talk like you, too
You'll see it's true, someone like me
Can learn to be like someone like you

[Verse 2]
Now don't try to kid me, mancub
I'll make a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire
To make my dream come true
Now, give me the secret, mancub
Come on, clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower
So I can be like you
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, oobee doo
I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you, talk like you, too
You'll see it's true, someone like me
Can learn to be like someone like you

[Verse 3]
Now you might think it's ridiculous
That me, a gigantopithecus
Would ever dream I'd like to team
With the likes of you, mancub
But together, we'd have powers
All the jungle's treasures, ours
I got desire, you got the fire
But the dream I dream takes two

[Chorus]
So, ooh, I wanna be like you
I wanna use that flame just the same, you can do
Oh, how magnificus it would be
A gigantopithecus like me
Could learn to do like you humans do
Can learn to be like someone like you
Can learn to be like someone like me
