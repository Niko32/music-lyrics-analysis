I been watchin' you lately
Chasin' your tail and it drives me crazy
You'll never get that girl
She don't see in you the things that I can see
The girl's ice cold, it ain't meant to be
Look, you'll never land a part in her world
I been spendin' time wondering why
Nothing that I do can catch your eye
Just can't capture your attention
Maybe I'm too tall or not your type
But I'm not givin' up, I'll get it right
Being close to you is my intention

[Pre-Chorus: Casey Lee Williams & Jeff Williams]
I see more in you than the rest of them do
And I'm not gonna let you fall (Let you fall)
I'll swallow my pride (Swallow my pride)
Time after time, 'cause you're worth it all

[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams]
Whenever I think of you
How I wish you only knew
You might be my dream come true
But what do I have to do to make you notice me?

Oh, ya know that, you and I, we would be alright
We could dance on the roof, we could light the night
Gotta make you see me in that way (That way)
Why don't ya forget about the little chick in white?
She don't care about you and she's so uptight (Hey!)
Let me put a smile on your face

[Pre-Chorus: Casey Lee Williams & Jeff Williams]
How I wish that you knew that I'm crazy for you
When I'm with you, time just flies (Time just flies)
I'll get you alone (Get you alone)
Make you my own, it will be divine

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Casey Lee Williams]
I can keep on waitin'
'Cause my heart, I been savin'
I think you're gonna figure it out
I'm the one for you and there's no one else

[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams]
Whenever I think of you
And how I wish you only knew
That you might be my dream come true
What do I have to do to make you my baby?
[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams]
Whenever I think of you
(Oh, whenever I think of you)
Only knew
(Oh, how I wish you knew that I'm in love with you)
Dream come true
(Ooh, woo)
What do I have to do to make you noticeâ€”

[Chorus: Casey Lee Williams]
It's gonna be you for me, and me for you (Think of you)
We're gonna shine a light and make a dream come true
Gotta get it right while we got the time (Only knew)
Gonna win your heart, I'm gonna make you mine
Come on, come on (Dream come true)
Come on, come on, come on, come on now, baby
What do I have to do to make you notice me? (Me)

[Outro: Casey Lee Williams]
Notice me
Notice me
