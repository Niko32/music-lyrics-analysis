Sitting on the top of the roof, the bridge is all mine
Steam engines roll by, the bridges fall down and so do my dreams

[Verse 1]
Boy, you hear me calling your name
The bridge is your time
Your engine rolls hot
If the bridges fall down, don't lose your head of steam

[Chorus]
Young man, I'm counting on you
And whoa, young man, I'm counting on you

[Verse 2]
Boy, I didn't make it too far, but baby you are
The family star
I'll tighten your seams
Don't lose your head of dreams
Boy, you hear me calling your name
The bridge is your time
Your engine rolls hot
If the bridges fall down, don't lose your head of steam

[Chorus]
Young man, I'm counting on you
And whoa, young man, I'm counting on you
To get me to the other side
Hey, hey hey hey, hey
You might also like[Verse 3]
This foot-pound pressure is new
Whatever you do is up to you
But do me this do: don't lose your head of dreams

[Chorus]
Young man, I'm counting on you
And whoa, young man, I'm counting on you

[Chorus]
Young man, I'm counting on you
And whoa, young man, I'm counting on you
And whoa, young man
You are now the man

[Post-Chorus / Outro]
Whoa, whoa, young man
I'm-a counting on you, hey hey hey
You are now the man
Can you get me to the other side?
Can you get me to the other side?
Hey, hey hey hey, huh huh
Hey hey, huh huh, hey hey hey
Don't lose your head of steam
Don't lose your head of steam
