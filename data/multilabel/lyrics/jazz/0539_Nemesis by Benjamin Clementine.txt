Home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home
Home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home

[Verse 1]
If I held my breath on you
I would have died a thousand times
And if chewing was to show you how much I cared
I would probably be wearing dentures by now

[Verse 1]
I said, if I held my breath on you
I would have died a thousand times
And if chewing was to show you how much I cared
I would probably be wearing dentures by now

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Our promises broken
Nemesis is our token
So you turn around and march on out to your new home
Wherever you’ve gone darling
Please don’t you ever forget to

[Chorus]
Treat others the way, you want to be treated
Remember your days are fully numbered
You might also like[Post-Chorus 1]
Home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home
Just march on
Home, home, home
Just march on
Home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home
March on
Home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home, home

[Verse 2]
If you held your breath on me
You would have died a million times
And if chewing was to show me how much you cared
You would have probably swallowed
Your tongue by now

[Verse 3]
All I’m trying to say darling
Is that you know very well
That I left her for you
Now I guess you are doing the same old
Same thing to me now

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Now these days Hennessy dries my veins
As our genesis smiles back at me
Now heresy might be your new fate, faith
Whatever you‘ve chosen to believe in darling
Don’t you ever forget to
[Chorus]
Treat others the way, you want to be treated
Remember your days are fully numbered

[Chorus]
Treat others the way, you want to be treated
Remember your days are fully numbered

[Post-Chorus 2]
Can’t say anything for you no more
Nemesis is on your case, darling
Next time
Treat others the way you want to be treated
Otherwise you’ll get your punishment
And life ain’t a bitch
Nemesis is, nemesis is, nemesis is, nemesis is
Is the mother of karma (Remember)
Karma (Remember)
Karma (Remember)
Karma (Remember, remember, remember)

[Outro]
So long you run
