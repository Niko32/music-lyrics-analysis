Who should we please?
Who's to believe?
Who should we change for?
Who could we be?
When my race is done
How did I run?
Did I par the course
And pass the baton on?

[Verse 2]
Vote with your feet
Make company
Form a military of peace and kill the king
Be a citizen of planet earth
Be a bigger man or woman 'cause we all can...

[Refrain: All]
Change
Change
Change

[Verse 3]
Change for its own sake
Uniformity gave me a belly ache
I want a mutiny
My mind is finally awake
Who could we be given equal opportunity?
What could we see given equal chance to actually see...

Change

[Verse 4: Cook Craig]
Is this what we consider changing for the better?
Maybe
Is this what we consider changing?
Ah, save me
Is this what we consider changing for the better?
Maybe
Is this what we consider changing?
I'm changing
I'm changing
Is this what we consider changing for the better?
Maybe
Is this what we consider changing?
Change
Is this what we consider changing?
I'm changing
I'm changing
Is this what we consider changing?

[Verse 5: Ambrose Kenny-Smith]
We're changing pace
Higher stakes
So called heroes wearing fake capes
Critically acclaimed
Clinically deranged
Push the buttons
Keep on frontin' 'til they hear the thumpin'
Somethings coming up the hallway out of the left
Field lane
Hey
My stomachs turning from the vermin up-skirt
Observing power hungry
Tryna draw the curtains from the public person but
There ain't no slicker villain that's deserving a
Serving on the killing floor
Put 'em on the chopping board for all to see
[Verse 7]
I'm like a sniper hiding in the tower
I'm picking them off one by one
Gateway drug to the only solution
Cutting out their tongues before they jump the gun
I'm the like the cupid trying bring the love
But you keep getting out of my range
No strings on my bow with broken arrows
Running low on ammo to make a change

[Verse 8: Joey Walker]
Buildings that you know, people come and go
Are a certain way, always are the same
And then you get the news that obliterates your view
Amputate your truths, the significance has changed

Hospital inane, meaningless and grey
But lie within the walls and the significance will change
What would it take for us to change the game?
Maybe our existence is significance in vain
The significance has changed
Maybe our existence is significance in vain

Buildings that you know, people come and go
Are a certain way, always are the same
And then you get the news that obliterates your view
Amputate your truths, the significance has changed
Hospital inane, meaningless and grey
But lie within the walls and the significance will change
What would it take for us to change the game?
Maybe our existence is significance in vain

[Verse 9: Stu Mackenzie]
What would it take to build an ark for me and my friends?
Escape this old place with all that creeps and fish in the sea
And all that flies and all the bugs inside of me
Take all the good things and leave the human beings
