I really can't stay, but baby it's cold outside
I got to go away, but baby it's cold outside
This evening has been—, been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice, I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mama will start to worry, beautiful, what's your hurry?
My daddy will be pacing the floor, listen to the fireplace roar
Really I better scurry, beautiful, please don't hurry
Maybe just half a drink more, put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think, baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink? No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how, your eyes are like star light
To break this spell, I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say: "No, no, no, sir," mind if I move in a bit closer?
At least I'm going to say I tried, what's the sense of hurting my pride?

[Chorus: Larry Lovestein, Ariana Grande & Both Harmonizing]
I really can't stay, baby, don't hold out
Baby, it's cold outside

[Verse 2: Larry Lovestein & Ariana Grande]
I simply must go, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no, baby, it's cold outside
The welcome has been—, how lovely that you dropped in
So nice and warm, look out the window and see the storm
My sister will be suspicious, gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door, waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious, gosh, your lips look delicious
Maybe just a cigarette more, never such a blizzard before
Gotta get home, but baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat, get on your knees right there
You've really been grand, I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see, how can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow, think of my life long sorrow
At least there'll be plenty implied, if you caught pneumonia and died

I really can't stay, baby, don't hold out
Baby, it's cold outside
