[Verse 1]
Said I've been out here in the building, oh
And I've been sitting by my telephone
And I'm sorry if you're feeling low
But tell me why-y-y is it so?
(Why is it so, baby?)

[Verse 2]
Said I been living through the up and downs
And I've been trying not to make a sound
And I'm sorry if you feel alone
But tell me why-y-y is it so?

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, go on baby
Go on baby
Roll with me
Oh baby

[Chorus]
And there will never be another girl like you
Baby, like you
And there will never be another girl like you
Mama, like you

Up to the moon, my baby's started stars
So I've been sitting by my telescope
And I'm sorry if you feel alone
But tell me why-y-y is it so?

[Verse 4]
I've been shit baby, go on, go through
Cut me in high up if you want to
Stop trying to hold my soul, baby
Why-y-y it can't be so

[Pre-Chorus 2]
What you gonna do, baby?
When the world catches fire
What you gonna do when I-
When I put it on you

[Chorus 2]
And there will never be another girl like you
Sugar, like you
And there will never be another girl like you
Cookie, like you
