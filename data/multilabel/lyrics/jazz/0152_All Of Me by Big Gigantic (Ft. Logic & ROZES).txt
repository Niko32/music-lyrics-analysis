Blow your smoke to fog up the mirror
Write our name in hearts, baby, I can see
That you're into me
I need your touch, yeah, I need your fever
Take my broken parts, take all of me
Take all of me

[Verse: Logic]
Yeah, take it all
Ain't no way I could break it off
Girl, is you really down to pay the cost?
Reverse the role and you could play the boss
Already knowin' my, already knowin' my vision is faded
I try to evade it, but can't
I know you far from a saint, but I keep lying to me
'Cause I been dying to meet
And it feel like I follow you out in the street
And I promise you all that I know
Every way that my mind goes
Elevated, heart strong, but my head faded
Way back when we first dated, I'm gone now
Had to go 'cause I'm on now
When my intuition got me in a mission
We see eye to eye but you ain't in my vision
Oh no, I said, oh no
Back in the day I used to say
A girl like you I used to pray for days for
Now I'm out here like way more
What the fuck would I stay for?
Why the fuck would I pay for
Somethin' that's just gonna kill me?
Nikki I'm still me, but I'm just better
It's been six months since we touched last
But I grow fast with this letter
And I swear to God that I'm better

Blow your smoke to fog up the mirror
Write our name in hearts, baby, I can see
That you're into me
I need your touch yeah I need your fever
Take my broken parts, take all of me
Take all of me
Blow your smoke to fog up the mirror
Write our name in hearts, baby, I can see
That you're into me
I need your touch, I need your fever
Take my broken parts, take all of me
Take all of me

[Outro: ROZES]
Take all of me
Take all of me
Take all of me
Take all of me
