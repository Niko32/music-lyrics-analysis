Perry!

[Verse 1]
He's a semi-aquatic egg-layin' mammal of action
(Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah
Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah)
He's a furry little flatfoot who'll never flinch from a fray-ee-ay-ee-ay
He's got more than just mad skill, he's got a beaver tail and bill
(Woah-oh-ahhh, wap-bap)
And the women swoon whenever they hear him say...
(*Platypus chatter*) (*sigh*)

[Chorus]
He's Perry!
Perry the Platypus!
Perry!
Perry the Platypus!

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Well, he's lookin' real sharp in his 1940s fedora
(Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah
Doo-bee-doo-bee-doo-bah)
He's got an iron will, nerves of steel, and several other metal-themed attributes
His fur is watertight, and he's always up for a fight
(Ooh, whoa-oh-ah, wop-bah)
So when evil hears this sound it shakes in its boots
(*Platypus chatter*)

[Chorus]
He's Perry!
Perry the Platypus!
Perry!
Perry the Platypus!
[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
He's got more than just mad skill, he's got a beaver tail and bill
(Woah-oh-ahhh, wap-bap)
And the women swoon whenever they hear him say...
*Platypus chartle*, *sigh*

[Chorus]
He's Perry! (Perry)
Perry the Platypus!
Perry! (Yeah)
Perry the Platypus!

[Outro]
Talkin' 'bout Perry!
Agent P!
