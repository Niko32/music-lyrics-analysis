As a singer grows older, his conception goes a little deeper
Because he lives life and he understands
What he's trying to say a little more

[Verse 1: Bobby Womack]
The earth is but a Dayglo reflection
A turn that will bring you only life
I'm forming to myself, but I'm not broken
Waiting for the day to bring me life

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
If everything said everything is everything
The only thing I ever dreamed is you and me
'Cause I break down, I take you down
And I love it every step of the way
Ooh, ah, ah, ah

[Bridge: Sam Cooke]
As a singer grows older, his conception goes a little deeper
Because he lives life and he understands
What he's trying to say a little more
As the singer tries to find out what's happening in life
It gives him a better insight
On telling the story of the song he's trying to sing

Watching from a distant constellation
Eyes that can see the world in changing hues
Visions still unfold in sweet imagining
Time reveals that love is the only truth

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
If everything said everything is everything
The only thing I ever dreamed is you and me
'Cause I break down, I take you down
And I love it every step of the way
Ooh, ah, ah, ah
