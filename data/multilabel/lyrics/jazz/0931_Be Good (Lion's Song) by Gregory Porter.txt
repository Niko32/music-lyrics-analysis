And I sing my lion's song and brush my mane

She would if she could
So she pulled my lion's tail and cause me pain
She said lions are made for cages
Just to look at in delight
You dare not let 'em walk around
'Cause they might just bite

Does she know what she does
When she dances around my cage
And says her name?

Be good, be good

Be good is her name
I trim my lion's claws and I
And I cut my mane
And I would if I could
But that woman treats me the same

She said lions are made for cages
Just to look at in delight
You dare not let 'em walk around
'Cause they might just bite

When she dances round my cage

Be good is her name
I sing my lion's song
Brush my mane

And she would

And cause me pain

You dare not let 'em walk around
