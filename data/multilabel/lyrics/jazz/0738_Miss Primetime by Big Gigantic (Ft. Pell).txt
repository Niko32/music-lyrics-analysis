Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Chorus]
Hold on to my mind, I wanna hear you lie
Step into the light so you can feel the life

[Verse]
I want that wet, wet, dripp and drown
Ain't no thing like this around
Ain't your mama tell you that you got you that something special?
Misses primetime
Got a private show tonight (and I'm ready for it)
Baby, it's too late to jump out that window
Remember that you're a star in my car as we creep slow
Got pipes like Whitney
Met you at the show, now you in the car with me
Friends at the bar all avant-garde
Want a minaj, but you no Nicki
Make out monster, don't leave no hickeys
Got one night left in your city
Want a new purse but my tank on empty
So I save that money, just give this dicky
Don't think, just take a ride with me
Headed nowhere, just hit that gas
School tomorrow, we'll skip that class
Cause I could, I could learn you something
No confidence when the lips keep touching
Manage you if you keep me coming
Turn on the bright lights and white discussions
I'll give you the life you wanted, say cheese
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Chorus]
Hold on to my mind, I wanna hear you lie
Step into the light so you can feel the life

[Pre-Chorus]
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on

[Partial Chorus]
Hold on to my mind
Step into the light
Hold on to my mind
Step into the light
Hold on to my mind
Step into the light
Hold on to my mind
Step into the light
