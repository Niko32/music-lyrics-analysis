We're all looking for someone, that perfect girl
Who can take our hand and help us see the world
But I'm a little unusual, because you see
I seek a different type of thrill for my romantic fantasy

[Pre-Chorus: Clyde Lawrence]
And I must say
I'm looking your way
Cause you seem to like me baby
And you give me all the signs
There's just one activity on my mind

[Chorus: Clyde Lawrence & Gracie Lawrence]
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?

[Verse 2: Clyde Lawrence]
Do you wanna do something with me tonight?
I'll put on my finest sweatpants and I'll order you pad thai
We'd be living our dream, as our love grows
What an intimate occasion, you and me and HBO

[Pre-Chorus: Clyde Lawrence]
'Til morning light
So wrong yet so right
So say you want it darling
'Cause you know I want it too
And there's just one thing that I wanna do
You might also like[Chorus: Clyde Lawrence & Gracie Lawrence]
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?

[Pre-Chorus: Clyde Lawrence]
Let's talk it through
In case you're confused
'Cause I know I can seem lazy
From these things I like to do
But they're only worth it when I'm with you
Yeah it's true, so do you...

[Chorus: Clyde Lawrence & Gracie Lawrence]
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?
Do you wanna do nothing with me?

[Bridge: Clyde Lawrence & Gracie Lawrence]

[Outro: Gracie Lawrence & Clyde Lawrence]

Wanna do nothing with me
Oh, but do you wanna do nothing with me?
