[Chorus]
(Conjunction Junction, what's your function?)
Hookin' up words and phrases and clauses
(Conjunction Junction, how's that function?)
I've got three favorite cars that get most of my job done
(Conjunction Junction, what's their function?)
I've got "and," "but," and "or," they'll get you pretty far

[Verse 1]
"And!" That's an additive, like this and that
"But!" That's sort of the opposite, not this, but that
And then there's "or," O-R
When you have a choice like this or that
"And," "but," and "or" get you pretty far!

[Chorus]
(Conjunction Junction, what's your function?)
Hooking up two boxcars and making 'em run right

[Verse 2]
Milk and honey, bread and butter
Peas and rice (Hey, that's nice)
Dirty but happy, digging and scratchin'
Losing your shoe and a button or two
He's poor but honest, sad but true
Boo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
You might also like[Chorus]
(Conjunction Junction, what's your function?)
Hooking up two cars to one
When you say something like this choice

[Verse 3]
Either now or later, or no choice
Neither now nor ever (Hey, that's clever)
Eat this or that, grow thin or fat
Never mind, I wouldn't do that
I'm fat enough now!

[Chorus]
(Conjunction Junction, what's your function?)
Hookin' up phrases and clauses that balance, like

[Verse 4]
Out of the frying pan and into the fire
He cut loose the sandbags
But the balloon wouldn't go any higher
Let's go up to the mountains
Or down to the seas
You should always say, "Thank you"
Or at least say, "Please!"

[Chorus]
(Conjunction Junction, what's your function?)
Hookin' up words and phrases and clauses
In complex sentences like
[Verse 5]
"In the mornings, when I'm usually wide awake
I love to take a walk through the gardens
And down by the lake
Where I often see a duck and a drake
And I wonder as I walk by
Just what they'd say if they could speak
Although, I know that's an absurd thought"

[Chorus]
(Conjunction Junction, what's your function?)
Hookin' up cars and making 'em function
(Conjunction Junction, how's that function?)
I like tyin' up words and phrases and clauses

[Chorus/Outro]
(Conjunction Junction, watch that function!)
I'm going to get you there if you're very careful
(Conjunction Junction, what's your function?)
I'm going to get you there if you're very careful
(Conjunction Junction, what's your function?)
I'm going to get you there if you're very careful...
