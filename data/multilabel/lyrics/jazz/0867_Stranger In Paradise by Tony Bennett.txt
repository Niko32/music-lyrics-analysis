Take my hand, I'm a stranger in paradise
All lost in a wonderland, a stranger in paradise
If I stand starry-eyed, that's a danger in paradise
For mortals who stand beside an angel like you

[Verse]
I saw your face, and I ascended
Out of the commonplace
Into the rarest somewhere in space
I hang suspended until I know
There's a chance that you'd care
Won't you answer this fervent prayer?
Of a stranger in paradise
Don't send me in dark despair
From all that I hunger for

[Outro]
But open your angel's arms
To the stranger in paradise
And tell him that he need be
A stranger no moreYou might also like
