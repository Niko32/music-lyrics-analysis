Show it to me
Your salary
When I'm feeling under
It enlightened me
Oh, you crazy moon
I work from 9 to 5

[Verse 1]
I don't know where to find you everyday
I'm working hard from 9 to 5
Been waiting for that promotion you said
But it's been years and I'm hanging on subsides

[Chorus]
If I could be on the magazine next to Conan
Wouldn't it be fine?
Oh, I'm just a guy works 9 to 5

[Verse 2]
Is there is someone waiting over me?
I dreamt of getting paid on time
I know I'm saying yes too easily
Life isn't always like love on the first sight

[Verse 3]
So tell me, Sheena, is it fun to stay?
While your man's working every time
Is it the fundamental thing to say?
'Cause everyone must have their own way to shine
You might also like[Chorus]
If I could be on the magazine next to Conan
Wouldn't it be fun?
Oh, I'm just a guy
No, I'm just a guy
I'm just a guy works 9 to
