I can still smell the fire
Though I know it's long died out
The smoke still hangs in my hair
And on some quiet evenings it burns my eyes

[Chorus]
So darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow

[Verse 2]
I once lived in the sea
Bring me to your ear, you can hear
The tide where I used to be
Though now I'm but a shell

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, baby, don't say "Sorry"

[Chorus]
Darling, play your violin
I know it's what you live for
Darling, play your violin
We will manage somehow
You might also like[Bridge]
Don't dare regret anything
Remember what you're here for, you

[Outro]
Just play your violin
We will manage somehow
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo
