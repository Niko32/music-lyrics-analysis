Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Laughing as we go
Happy all the way
'Round the town we ride
Makes no difference where
With my baby by my side
I don't really care

[Chorus]
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
They just seem to say
That the Merry Christmas time
Can't be far away

[Verse 2]
Riding through the night
With the one you love and love
Glistening snow upon the ground
Glistening stars above
Just the way it was, in the long ago
Ol' Dobbin is our friendly guide
Gliding through the snow
You might also like[Chorus]
Ah, jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way, ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh, hey
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way
Oh, what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

[Outro]
Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh
Laughing as we go
Happy all the way
'Round the town we ride
Makes no difference where
With my baby by my side
I don't really care
Ah, jingle bells, jingle bells
