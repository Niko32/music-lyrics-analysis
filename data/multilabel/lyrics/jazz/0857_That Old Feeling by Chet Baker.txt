[Verse 1]
I saw you last night and got that old feeling
When you came in sight, I got that old feeling
The moment that you danced by, I felt a thrill
And when you caught my eye, my heart stood still

[Verse 2]
Once again, I seemed to feel that old yearning
And I knew the spark of love was still burning
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling is still in my heart

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Outro]
There'll be no new romance for me, it's foolish to start
For that old feeling is still in my heartYou might also like
