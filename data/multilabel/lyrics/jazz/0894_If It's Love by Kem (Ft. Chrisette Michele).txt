I’m sitting here
In my bed
I’ve been thinkin' 'bout
Everything that’s been said
I realize
What’s at stake
From the moment I met you
I just ain’t been the same

[Pre-Chorus: Kem]
I need you
Here in my life
And we both know
That’s a hard thing to find
Girl, I’m a good man
And you’re a good woman
There’s so much more
I want to discover, baby

[Chorus: Kem & Chrisette Michele]
If it’s love
It last a lifetime
Deep in my heart, I know, baby
If it’s love
It last forever
It’ll just start to show, baby (Ooh, ho)

You know I played the field
For the longest time
Was in and out of love
Oh I, oh I paid the price
Tell me can you comprehend
What you make me feel?
Heaven only knows why
Broken hearts can heal

[Pre-Chorus: Chrisette Michele]
I need you
Here by my side
If you’re not in my world, boy
Ain’t nothin' right
You’re a good man
And I’m a good woman too
There’s so much more
To discover with you, if it's love

[Chorus: Kem, Chrisette Michele & Both]
If it’s love (Ooh), it last a lifetime (Last a lifetime)
Deep in my heart, I know, baby
If it's love, girl (If it's love, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh), it last forever (Ooh, ooh)
It’ll just start to show (Woah-oh, woah, baby)
[Bridge: Kem, Chrisette Michele & Both]
Maybe we can work it out
Maybe we can find the time
Maybe we can settle down, girl
Boy, you know your heart is mine
Maybe we can find a way to love a little better
Maybe we can a way to keep it all together
Maybe have a little faith and pray for this love, love

[Chorus: Kem, Chrisette Michele & Both]
If it’s love, hey, girl (Hoo, it’ll last a lifetime)
Deep in my heart, I know, I know (Deep in my heart, good, babe, I know)
If it's love (If it’s love), it last forever
It’ll just start, show, baby (To show, whoa, whoa, hoo, hoo-hoo)

[Outro: Kem & Chrisette Michele]
La-da-da, da, da
If it's love
If it's love, girl
If it's love
Baby
If it's love
Baby, I know
Baby, I know
La-da-da, da, da
If it's love
If it's love, girl
It'll last forever
Baby, hey, girl
If it's love
