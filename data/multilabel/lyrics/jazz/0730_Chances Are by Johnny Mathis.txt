Chances are, 'cause I wear a silly grin
The moment you come into view
Chances are, you think that I'm in love with you
Just because my composure sort of slips
The moment that your lips meet mine
Chances are, you think my heart's your valentine

[Bridge]
In the magic of moonlight
When I sigh, "Hold me close, dear"
Chances are, you'll believe the stars
That fill the skies are in my eyes

[Verse 2]
Guess you feel you'll always be
The one and only one for me
And if you think you could
Well, chances are, your chances are awfully good

[Bridge]
Chances are, you'll believe the stars
That fill the skies are in my eyes

[Verse 2]
Guess you feel you'll always be
The one and only one for me
And if you think you could
Well, chances are, your chances are awfully good
You might also like[Outro]
The chances are, your chances are awfully good
