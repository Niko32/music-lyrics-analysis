Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight
It's time to say goodbye, let me tell you now
Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight
It's time to say goodbye

[Refrain]
Now, all night long you've been drinking your tequila
But now you've sucked your lemon peel dry
So why not get high, high, high? And
Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight

[Verse 2]
Goodnight ladies, ah, ladies goodnight
It's time to say goodbye
Goodnight sweet ladies, ah, ladies goodnight
It's time to say goodbye, bye-bye

[Refrain]
Ah, we've been together for the longest time
But now it's time to get high
Come on, let's get high, high, high
And goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight

[Verse 3]
Oh, I'm still missing my other half
Oh, it must be something I did in the past
Don't it just make you wanna laugh?
It's a lonely Saturday night
You might also like[Verse 4]
Oh, nobody calls me on the telephone
I put another record on my stereo
But I'm still singing a song of you
It's a lonely Saturday night

[Bridge]
Now, if I was an actor or a dancer who is glamorous
Then you know an amorous life would soon be mine
But now the tinsel light of star break
Is all that's left to applaud my heart break
And at eleven o'clock I watch the network news
Oh, woah, woah

[Verse 5]
Something tells me that you're really gone
You said we could be friends, but that's not what I want
Ah, anyway, my TV dinner's almost done
It's a lonely Saturday night

[Outro]
I mean to tell you, it's a lonely Saturday night
One more once, it's a lonely Saturday night
