I'm Lester the Nightfly
Hello Baton Rouge
Won't you turn your radio down
Respect the seven second delay we use
So you say there's a race
Of men in the trees
You're for tough legislation
Thanks for calling
I wait all night for calls like these

[Chorus]
An independent station
WJAZ
With jazz and conversation
From the foot of Mt. Belzoni
Sweet music
Tonight the night is mine
Late line 'til the sun (til' the sun) comes through the skyline

[Verse 2: Fagen]
I've got plenty of java
And Chesterfield Kings
But I feel like crying
I wish I had a heart of ice
A heart like ice
You might also likeIf you want your honey
To look super swell
You must spring for that little blue jar
Patton's Kiss And Tell
Kiss And Tell

[Chorus]
An independent station
WJAZ
With jazz and conversation
From the foot of Mt. Belzoni
Sweet music
Tonight the night is mine
Late line 'til the sun (til' the sun) comes through the skyline

[Bridge: Fagen]
You'd never believe it
But once there was a time
When love was in my life
I sometimes wonder
What happened to that flame
The answer's still the same
It was you, it was you
Tonight you're still on my mind

[Guitar Solo]
[Chorus]
An independent station
WJAZ
With jazz and conversation
From the foot of Mt. Belzoni
Sweet music
Tonight the night is mine
Late line 'til the sun (til' the sun) comes through the skyline
