You know you wanna take a chance and be a little bit bad
Ain't nothing quite like living on the edge, so get ready to go
I'm chasing down a thrill and lookin' fit to kill
So listen to the words a wise man said
He said "Covington, I got an offer that you can't refuse"
Ha!

[Chorus]
You got nothing to lose boys, lose, lose, lose
You got nothing to lose boys, lose, lose, lose
You got nothing to lose

[Verse 2]
Welcome to my stage, boys
You know you want a little taste
Life's short, not a minute to waste
I'll take you higher than you've ever been
So come over and tell me how you'd like to begin

[Chorus]
You got nothing to lose boys, lose, lose, lose
You got nothing to lose boys, lose, lose, lose
You got nothing to lose

[Bridge]
Alex, show me what you've got!
Reggie! Swingin', baby!
Now Luke!
You and me
How you like my new band?
You got nothing to lo-
You might also like[Outro]
So come over here baby
I got what you need
Let yourself go crazy
All bets on me, it's electrifying
From your hat to your shoes
I feel it in the air, we got nothing to lose
