Today, my bird flew away
Gone to find her big blue jay
Starlight before she took flight
I sang her "Lullaby of Birdland" every night
I sang a lullaby every night
Sang for my Ava every night

[Pre-Chorus]
Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound

[Chorus]
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

[Verse 2]
With dread, I woke in my bed
To shooting pains up in my head
Lovebird, my beautiful bird
Spoke until, one day, she couldn't be heard
She spoke until, one day, she couldn't be heard
She just stopped singing
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound

[Chorus]
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

[Pre-Chorus]
Ava was the morning, now she's gone
She's reborn like Sarah Vaughan
In the sanctuary she has found
Birds surround her sweet sound

[Chorus]
And Ava flies in paradise
And Ava flies in paradise

[Outro]
She flies in paradise
