[Chorus]
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, bananaphone
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, bananaphone
I've got this feeling, so appealing
For us to get together and sing, sing
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, bananaphone
Ding dong, ding dong, ding dong, ding, donanaphone
It grows in bunches, I've got my hunches
It's the best, beats the rest, cellular, modular, interactivodular
Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, bananaphone
Ping pong, ping pong, ping pong, ping, pananaphone
It's no baloney, it ain't a phony
My cellular, bananular phone

[Bridge]
Don't need quarters, don't need dimes to call a friend of mine
Don't need computer or TV to have a real good time
I'll call for pizza, I'll call my cat, I'll call the White House, have a chat
I'll place a call around the world
Operator, get me Bejing-jing-jing-jing

[Piano solo]
Yeah
Play that thing

Ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, ring, bananaphone
Yin yang, yin yang, yin yang, ying, yonanaphone
It's a real live mama and papa phone, a brother and sister, and a dogaphone
A grandpaphone and a grandmaphone too, oh yeah
My cellular, bananular phone

[Outro]
Bananaphone, ring, ring, ring
(It's a phone with appeal!)
Bananaphone, ring, ring, ring
(Now you can have your phone and eat it too!)
Bananaphone, ring, ring, ring
(This song drives me bananas!)
Bananaphone, ring, ring, ring
