[Verse 1]
There will be many other nights like this
And I'll be standing here with someone new
There will be other songs to sing
Another fall, another spring
But there will never be another you

[Verse 2]
There will be other lips that I may kiss
But they won't thrill me like yours used to do
Yes I may dream a million dreams
But how can they come true
If there will never ever be another you
