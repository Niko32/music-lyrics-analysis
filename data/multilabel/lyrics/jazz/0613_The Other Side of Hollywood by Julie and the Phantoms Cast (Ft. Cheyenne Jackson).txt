Let me introduce myself
We got some time to kill
Consider me the pearly gates to your new favorite thrills
We could go make history or you could rest in peace
But here there ain’t no misery
'Cause on the other side we live like kings

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Let your body loose, let your body loose
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Show you a thing or two
'Cause you ain’t seen nothing

[Chorus]
Life is good on the other side of Hollywood
Life is good on the other side of Hollywood
So welcome to the brotherhood
Where you won’t be misunderstood
Life is good on the other side of Hollywood

[Verse 2]
Everything has got a price but happiness is free
Just so happens, you’re in luck
We’ve got a vacancy
We can set the night on fire and break out of the scene
Your soul print on the walk of fame on the boulevard of your wildest dreams
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do, boys?
Let your body loose, let your body loose
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do, boys?
It ain't bragging if it’s true
Now you ain't seen nothing

[Chorus]
Life is good on the other side of Hollywood
Life is good on the other side of Hollywood
So welcome to the brotherhood
Where you won’t be misunderstood
Life is good on the other side of Hollywood

[Bridge]
The rain don’t blind the rising souls
They got too much to see
I got your glamour, got your gold
Got all you’ll ever need
Let me hear you now!
The rain don’t blind the rising souls, they got too much to see
Yeah
I got your glamour, got your gold
Got all you’ll ever need
Yeah
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Watch me make a move, watch me make a move, boys
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Watch me make a move, no, I don’t disappoint
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Amen!
Watch me make a move, I’m ya number one choice
Whatcha gonna do? Whatcha gonna do?
Watch me make a move, come on and give me that noise
A tomb with a view
Ain’t it something?

[Chorus]
Yeah, life is good on the other side of Hollywood
Yeah, life is good on the other side of Hollywood
So welcome to the brotherhood
Where you won’t be misunderstood
Life is good on the other side of Hollywood
So welcome to the brotherhood
Where you won’t be misunderstood
Life is good on the other side of Hollywood

[Outro]
Ain’t it the best?
Long live the dead!
