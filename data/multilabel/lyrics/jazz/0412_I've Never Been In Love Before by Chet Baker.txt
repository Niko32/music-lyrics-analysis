I've never been in love before
Now all at once, it's you
It's you forevermore
I've never been in love before
I thought my heart was safe
I thought I knew the score

[Chorus]
But this is wine
It's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish song and out my song must pour
So please forgive this helpless haze I'm in
I've really never been in love before
I've really never been in love before

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
But this is wine
It's all too strange and strong
I'm full of foolish song and out my song must pour
So please forgive this helpless haze I'm in
I've really never been in love before
I've really never been in love beforeYou might also like
