The last time our module would ring you
Like a lunar bell
I'll see you on the moon
Until we meet at Tycho
And follow the trail

[Pre-Chorus]
Synodic season
To come out of hiding
Why'd it take so long?
Inching out of orbit dividing
Where did I go wrong?

[Chorus 1]
I'll see you on the moon
Where we're throwing a party
And as you're gasping for the last of air
Youâ€™ll tra-la-la-la-la
You give me fifty-nine percent from libration
We dance in synchronous rotation
[Verse 2]
The image we see of you has been
Just a little late
There is no atmosphere
To wear down any sharpness
It's not how long you wait
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Synodic season
To come out of hiding
Why'd it take so long?
Inching out of orbit dividing
Where did I go wrong?

[Bridge]
A wise woman said I'm alive
Nobody's ever told her she's wrong
A paella of space-talking jive
I'm as alive as her beard is long

[Chorus 2]
I'll see you on the moon
Where we're throwing a party
And as you're gasping for the last of air
You'll tra-la-la-la-la
Twirling moon dust abound
Lung destruction is starting
Take your suit off and swim in maria
I'll see you on the moon
There's already a party
And as you're gasping for the last of air
You'll tra-la-la-la-la
[Outro]
No es la locura
En realidad es el amor
Now that you've heard it all
There is the door
