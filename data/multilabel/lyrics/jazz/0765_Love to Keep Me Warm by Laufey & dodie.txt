I love the winter weather
So the two of us can get together
There's nothing sweeter, finer
When it's nice and cold
I can hold my baby closer to me
And collect the kisses that are due me
I love the winter weather
'Cause I got my love to keep me warm

[Chorus: dodie]
I love the winter weather
So the two of us can get together
There's nothing sweetеr, finer
When it's nice and cold
I can hold my baby closеr to me
And collect the kisses that are due me
I love the winter weather
'Cause I got my love to keep me warm

[Bridge: Laufey, dodie & Both]
Winter's upon us, so won't you stay?
With me from Christmas to New Year's Day
Don't leave me alone
(I won't)
Let's light a fire and let it snow
