What a diff'rence a day made
Twenty-four little hours
Brought the sun and the flowers
Mm, where there used to be rain
My yesterday was blue, dear
Today I'm a part of you, dear
My lonely nights are through, dear
Since you said you were mine

[Verse 2]
Lord, what a diff'rence a day makes
There's a rainbow before me
Skies above can't be stormy
Since that moment of bliss
That thrilling kiss
It's heaven when you
Find romance on your menu
What a diff'rence a day made
And the difference is youYou might also like
