We done a lot of living
We working overtime
Don't need another million
You got that gold mine
I love the way you're livin'
'Cause you so genuine
You got that something special
Didn't you know?
I just need you, you, you

[Verse 1]
Met you when I was a lil' nappy head boy
And I never put down my alto saxophone, yeah
Buckjumpin' down on the boulevard
I couldn't wait to blow my own horn (Woo)
It ain't wrong for you to play along
Playing this song 'til you die, come on

[Pre-Chorus]
In this world with a lot of problems
All we need is a little loving
Thank you, thank you, oh, you make me
Thank you, thank you for your love

[Chorus]
We done a lot of living
We working overtime
Don't need another million
You got that gold mine
I love the way you're livin' (Hey)
'Cause you're so genuine (Genuine)
You got that something special
Didn't you know?
I just need you, you, you (Come on, now)
You might also like[Verse 2]
Met you when I was a lil' country boy
And I never put down that pork chop and salt
Then we fell in love on the boulevard
If you was Jenny, I guess I was Forrest (Run)
Nah, it ain't wrong for you to sing along
Singing this song 'til you die

[Pre-Chorus]
In this world with a lot of problems
All we need is a little loving
Thank you, thank you, oh, you make me
Thank you, thank you for your love

[Chorus]
We done a lot of living (Whole lotta)
We working overtime (Overtime)
Don't need another million
You got that gold mine (Gold mine)
I love the way you're livin'
'Cause you're so genuine (Genuine)
You got that something special
Didn't you know?
I just need you, you, you
You, you, you, you
