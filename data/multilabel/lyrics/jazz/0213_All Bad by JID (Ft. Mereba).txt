Mmm-mmm, mmm
Mmm-mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, woah

[Chorus: J.I.D, J.I.D and Mereba and Mereba]
And if I'm tryna tell the truth, it's all bad (All bad, all bad)
'Cause if you looking for the proof, it's all there (All there)
Come on baby, I'ma tell the truth and nothing but the truth (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
You can't handle the truth, (You can't handle the truth) you can't handle it (You can't handle it), ah-ahh
And if I'm tryna tell the truth, it's all bad (It's all bad, all bad)
'Cause if you looking for the proof, it's all there (It's all there)
Come on baby, I'ma tell the truth and nothing but the truth (Ooh-ooh, ooh)
You can't handle it, (You can't handle it) you can't handle the truth, no (You can't handle the truth, no)

[Verse 1: J.I.D & Mereba]
Doo, doo, doo-doo, doo
And if I'm trying to tell the truth, it's all bad
Huh, baby, do you love me? I know that you do
I been trying so hard, I know I gotta be real with you
Can't be playing with hearts, I know you feel like you feel it too (Feel it too)
I'm gon' step into the shade
I don't want the sun in my face, but I don't want to walk away
Without me saying what I have to say
But I been praying it's another way
But this like mayhem on my fucking brain
I gotta say, I'm finna go insane
Shame, shame, and I don't know what I can do (Fuck)
'Cause maybe your past guy
And maybe your last guy was probably just right for you
And baby, I can't fight the truth
Baby, I can't fight the truth
And baby, I can't fight with you, yeah

[Bridge 1: J.I.D, Mereba with Both]
Doo, doo, doo-doo, doo
And since I'm tryna tell the truth
So tell me why you got to lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie?
So tell me why you got to lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie, lie lie?

[Verse 2: Mereba]
See I'ma call it off here
Boy this intuition ancient, oh
You ain't even really gotta say shit
I peep your in-the-cut shit, yeah, I'm a sharp motherfuck—er
No peace 'til we sleeping
We find reasons for deceiving
And then we both been keeping secrets
I remember when it felt like a dream (Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
I hope it's a blessed world
Though I bet your next girl won't tell you the truth–
Like I do
It's just we were coasting on a new high
You never let slip that hand on my hip
It was Heaven, it was bliss 'til it flipped right
I ain't finna lie to you though
I ain't finna cry, nevermind that you lied (Lied)
That you spilled milk all on my clothes (Fuck)
They say you reap what you sow
Lord knows that's some lies I've been told
Oooh, watch it grow
[Chorus: J.I.D & Mereba]
And I done finally heard the truth, it's all bad (All bad, all bad)
I wasn't looking for the proof, but goddamn (Goddamn)
Come on baby, you should tell the truth, but baby fuck the truth
I can't handle it, (I can't handle it) you can't handle it

[Bridge 2: J.I.D and Mereba]
Ba-da-da-da-da-da-da, da-da, da-da (Ooh, ooh)
Da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da (Yeah, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah)
Da, da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da (Ooh, ooh, doo-doo-doo-doo)
Da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da, da-da-da
Da-duh-da, huh, hm

[Outro: Mereba]
You got me extremely fucked up
