Oh

[Verse 1]
Sorry, I wanna love you
One too many bad decisions
No
Sorry, I wanna love you
It wasn't my intentions, girl, to hurt you
No way

[Pre-Chorus]
Say you need space from me
I never felt love, but it feels like I'm fallin' (Fallin', fallin', huh, yeah)
I know you got niggas on your line callin' (Callin', callin')
Them niggas never gon' put they all in (All in, all in)

[Chorus]
I can't say sorry enough, enough
I can't go back in time for you
I know it when we lovin' (Ooh, love)
Believe in me again like I believe in you

[Post-Chorus]
I can't say sorry enough
Sorry, I wanna love you
Sorry, I wanna love you
I can't say sorry enough
Sorry, I wanna love you
Sorry, I wanna love you
(Sorry, I wanna love you)
