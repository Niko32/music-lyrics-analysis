'Zat You, Santa Claus?

[Verse 1]
Gifts I'm preparing for some Christmas sharing
But I pause because
Hanging my stocking I can hear a knocking
'Zat you, Santa Claus?

[Verse 2]
Sure is dark out, ain't the slightest spark out
Pardon my clackin' jaws!
Who's there? Who is it stopping for a visit?
'Zat you, Santa Claus?

[Refrain 1]
Are you bringing a present for me
Something pleasantly pleasant for me?
Then it's just what I've been waiting for
Would you mind slipping it under the door?

[Verse 3]
Cold winds are howling, or could that be growling?
My legs feel like straws
My my oh me my, kindly would you reply?
'Zat you, Santa Claus?
You might also like[Instrumental]

[Verse 4]
Hanging the stocking, I can hear a knocking
'Zat you, Santa Claus?
I say, who's there, who is it? Are you stopping for a visit?
'Zat you, Santa Claus?

[Refrain 2]
Oh there, Santa, you gave me a scare
Now stop teasing cause I know you're there
We don't believe in no goblins today
But I can't explain why I'm shaking that way

[Verse 5]
Bet I can see ole Santa in the keyhole
I'll get to the cause
One peek and I'll try there; oh oh, there's an eye there!
'Zat you, Santa Claus?

[Outro]
Please, please, pity my knees!
Say that's you, Santa Claus!
That's him alright!
