Them that's got shall get, them that's not shall lose
So the Bible said and it still is news
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

[Verse 2]
Yes, the strong gets more while the weak ones fade
Empty pockets don't ever make the grade
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own

[Bridge]
Money, you got lots of friends
Crowding 'round the door
When you're gone, spending ends
They don't come no more

[Verse 3]
Rich relations give crust of bread and such
You can help yourself but don't take too much
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own
You might also like[Outro]
Mama may have, Papa may have
But God bless the child that's got his own
That's got his own
He just don't worry 'bout nothin'
'Cause he's got his own
