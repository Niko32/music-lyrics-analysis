Lover, tell me, if you can
Who’s gonna buy the wedding bands?
Times being what they are
Hard, and getting harder all the time

[ORPHEUS]
Lover, when I sing my song
All the rivers will sing along
And they’re gonna break their banks for me
Lay their gold around my feet
All a-flashing in the pan
All to fashion for your hand
The rivers are gonna give us the wedding bands

[EURYDICE]
Lover, tell me, if you’re able
Who’s gonna lay the wedding table?
Times being what they are
Dark, and getting darker all the time

[ORPHEUS]
Lover, when I sing my song
All the trees are gonna sing along
And bend their branches down to me
To lay their fruit around my feet
The almond and the apple
And the sugar from the maple
The trees gonna lay the wedding table

Lover, tell me, when we’ll wed
Who’s gonna make the wedding bed?
Times being what they are
Hard, and getting harder all the time

[ORPHEUS]
Lover, when I sing my song
All the birds gonna sing along
And they’ll come flying round to me
To lay their feathers at my feet
And we’ll lie down in eiderdown
A pillow ’neath our heads
The birds are gonna make the wedding bed

[EURYDICE]
And the trees are gonna lay the wedding table

[ORPHEUS]
And the rivers are gonna give us the wedding bands
