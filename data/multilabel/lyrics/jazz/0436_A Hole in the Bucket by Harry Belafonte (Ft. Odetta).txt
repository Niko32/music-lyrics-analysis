I now have the pleasure to sing with Mr. Belafonte

Henry? Oh, Henry? (Yes, Liza)
Could you fetch the water? (Go fetch the water?)

[Verse: Harry Belafonte, Odetta]
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, dear Liza
There's a hole in the bucket, dear Liza, a hole

Well, fix it dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry
So fix it dear Henry, dear Henry, fix it

With what shall I fix it, dear Liza, dear Liza
With what shall I fix it, dear Liza, with what?

With straw, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry
With straw, dear Henry, dear Henry, with straw

But the straw is too long, dear Liza, dear Liza

Cut it dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry
Well, cut it dear Henry, dear Henry, cut it!

With what shall I cut it, dear Liza, dear Liza
With what shall I cut it, dear Liza, with what?
With an axe, dear Henry, dear Henry, dear Henry
With an axe, dear Henry, with an axe
