Woo, woo-woo

Woo-woo

[Chorus: Phoelix]
They told me put my hands up behind my head
I think they got the wrong one
I'm sick and tired of runnin' (Runnin')
I been searchin' where the love went (Love went)
I been lookin' for a dove
Then they told me if I move, they gon' shoot me dead
But I think I'm 'bout to cut a rug (Cut a rug)
I been waitin' on the summer (Summer)
Soul lookin' back and wonders
"How we 'posed to get from under?"
They told me put my hands up behind my head
I think they got the wrong one
I'm sick and tired of runnin' (Runnin')
I been searchin' where the love went (Love went)
I been lookin' for a dove
Then they told me if I move, they gon' shoot me dead
But I think I'm 'bout to cut a rug (Cut a rug)
I been waitin' on the summer (Summer)
Soul lookin' back and wonders
"How we 'posed to get from under?"
They told me put my hands up behind my head
