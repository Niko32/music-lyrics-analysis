Look out! Look out!
Pink elephants on parade
Here they come!
Hippity-hoppity
They're here and there
Pink elephants everywhere

Look out! Look out!
They're walking around the bed, on their head
Clippity-cloppity
Arrayed in braid
Pink elephants on parade

What'll I do? What'll I do?
What an unusual view!
I can stand the sight of worms
And look at microscopic germs
But technicolor pachyderms
Is really too much for me

I am not the type to faint
When things are odd or things are quaint
But seeing things you know that ain't
Can certainly give you an awful fright!
What a sight!
You might also likeChase 'em away!
Chase 'em away!
I'm afraid, need your aid
Pink elephants on parade!

Pink elephants!
Pink elephants!
