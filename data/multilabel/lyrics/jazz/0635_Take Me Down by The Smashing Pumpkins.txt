And take me down, to the underground
Won't you take me down, to the underground
Why oh why, there is no light
And if I can't sleep, can you hold my life?
And all I see is you

[Verse 2: James Iha]
And take my hand, I lost where I began
In my heart I know all of my faults, will you help me understand?
And I believe in you, you're the other half of me
Soothe and heal, when you sleep, when you dream
I'll be there if you need me, whenever I hear you sing

[Outro: James Iha]
There is a sun
It'll come, the sun
Hear them call me down
I held you once, a love that once, and life had just begun
And you're all I see
And trumpets blew, and angels flew on the other side, dear
And you're all I see, and you're all I'll need
There's a love that God puts in your heartYou might also like
