Hold on to the colour in your day
I will always be around to reach your pain
Home is where you don't have to carry all of the worry (Oh, no, no)
You don't have to bury (Bury all) all of the memories
Hold on, love, hold on, love, hold on, love, hold on, love
Hold on to, on to each other when you can
Time will always come around to meet you with the answers
Home is in your body
