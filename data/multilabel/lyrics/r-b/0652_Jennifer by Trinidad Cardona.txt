I'm reachin' for your soul, oh, my

[Chorus]
Jennifer, would you infer?
I know you're playin' games, I know that's how it works
The first girl that I loved, first girl that I hurt
I'm callin' out for Jennifer, been callin' out for her
I'm callin' for you Jennifer, oh, my
The pain in your eyes when I slipped up and fucked Caroline
I know you playin' games, girl, you on my mind
The girl I wanna finish with until the end of time
And now I'm like

[Bridge]
Oh, my, baby, oh
No, alright, oh, oh baby, oh
No, alright, I'm like, baby, oh (My, my, my, my, my)
I'm reachin' for your soul, oh, my
I'm reachin' for your soul, oh, my (You still love me? Yeah)

[Verse 1]
I whip, she stunt
We milly rock when we walk
She never leavin' me out, I'm never lettin' her down
I'll never leave my baby 'cause she my leader
I'm gonna steer her, never not gonna fear her

[Verse 2]
Jennifer, Jennifer, ayy
Jennifer, Jennifer
Let me know how it work 'fore I'm all in the dirt
One call for the boy, never goin' berzerk
Need you off of my mind so I'm watching her twerk
See your boy on a wave, now they all gonna surf
You're the love of my life but you leavin' me hurt
See the pain in your eyes 'cause I did do you worse
But my love never dies, multiplied to the third
She ridin' with me, and I'm being honest
If you fuckin' with us, got the crew behind us
I been grillin' niggas like I'm Benihana's
Only foreign women, no Americanas
I been fuckin' wit her, and her two hermanas
Dime que te gusta y te veo ma√±ana
Call me papi chulo, hotter than the sauna
Now she rubbin' on it like she rubbin' Rana, that's, ayy
[Chorus]
Jennifer, would you infer?
I know you playin' games, I know that's how it works
The first girl that I loved, first girl that I hurt
I'm callin' out for Jennifer, been callin' out for her
I'm callin' for you Jennifer, oh, my (Oh, my)
The pain in your eyes, when I slipped up and fucked Caroline
I know you playin' games, girl, you on my mind
The girl I wanna finish with until the end of time
And now I'm like
