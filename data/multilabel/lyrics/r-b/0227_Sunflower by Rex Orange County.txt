Woah
I want to know where I can go
When you're not around, and I'm feeling down
So won't you stay for a moment so I can say
I
I need you so? 'Cause right now, you know
That nothing here's new, and I'm obsessed with you
Then I fell to the ground, and you smiled at me and said

[Verse 1]
I don't wanna see you cry
You don't have to feel this emptiness
She said, "I'll love you till the day that I die"
Well, maybe she's right
'Cause I don't wanna feel like I'm not me
And to be honest, I don't even know why
I let myself get down in the first place

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down, down, do-down-down
Diggy, dig down, doo-doo-doo-doo
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
You might also like[Verse 2]
You know you need to get yourself to sleep and dream
A dream of you and I
There's no need to keep an open eye
I promise I'm the one for you
Just let me hold you in these arms tonight
I'm lucky to be me and you can see it in my face
Back when I fucked my shit up too many times
Why would I let myself get down in the first place?

[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down, down, do-down-down
Diggy, dig down, doo-doo-doo-doo
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes

[Bridge]
And so she sat me down and told me that I didn't have to cry
Said I didn't need to get down or feel empty inside
And told me that she'll love me for as long as she's alive
And well, maybe she's right
'Cause I hate it when I feel like I'm not me
See, I honestly don't even know why
I-I honestly don't even know why
[Chorus]
Tryna keep my mind at bay
Sunflower still grows at night
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
Make it down, down, do-down-down
Diggy, dig down, doo-doo-doo-doo
Waiting for a minute till the sun's seen through my eyes
