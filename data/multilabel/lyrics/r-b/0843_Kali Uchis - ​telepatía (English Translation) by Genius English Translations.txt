Who would have known
That you can make love telepathically
The moon is full, my bed is empty
What I would do to you
If I had you in front of me, I would blow your mind
Night and day, night and day

[Verse 1]
You know I'm just a flight away
If you want it, you can take a private plane
Kilometres away we're connecting
And you turn me on without even touching me
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
And they tell me everything you're thinking
I imagine what you've already been plotting

[Chorus]
Who would have known
You could make love telepathically
The moon is full, my bed is empty
What I would do to you
If I had you in front of mе, I would blow your mind
Night and day, night and day
You might also like[Verse 2]
You know that I can see right through you
I can read your mind, I can read your mind
What you want to do?
It's written all ovеr your face times two
'Cause I can read your mind, I can read your mind
I can hear your thoughts like a melody
Listen while you talk when you're fast asleep
You stay on the phone just to hear me breathe
On repeat

[Chorus]
Who would have known
You could make love telepathically
The moon is full, my bed is empty
What I would do to you
If I had you in front of me, I would blow your mind
Night and day, night and day

[Outro]
You know I got a lot to say
All these voices in the background of my brain
