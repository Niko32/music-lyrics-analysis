I thought we were great
You took your love back and ran us off track
I counted all the days
'Til you would come back, how stupid was that?

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're missin' what we used to have
Guess the vodka brought the feelin' back
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
Ask how many nights I've been thinkin' of you
Zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent, but all I got from you
Zero, zero
I thought you were the one (Hey)
Then you turned and run (Hey)
Found somebody better
Like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinkin' of you
Zero, zero

[Post-Chorus]
(Zero, zero, zero, zero)
(Zero, zero, zero, zero)
(Zero, zero, zero)
That’s how many fucks I give, oh
You might also like[Verse 2]
Wake up with a dime
Get up to no good, better than you could
Go out, free our minds
Like you never would, never understood

[Pre-Chorus]
Now you're missin' what we used to have
You been creepin' 'round my Instagram
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know

[Chorus]
Ask how many nights I've been thinkin' of you
Zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent, but all I got from you
Zero, zero
I thought you were the one (Hey)
Then you turned and run (Hey)
Found somebody better
Like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinkin' of you
Zero, zero

[Post-Chorus]
(Zero, zero, zero, zero)
(Zero, zero, zero, zero)
(Zero, zero, zero)
That’s how many fucks I give
[Verse 3]
Broke back then but a nigga rich now
Got dollars, got euros, got yen, I got pounds
Zeros, zeros
Callin' me up ‘cause your bad check bounced
My new chick one hundred, and she got her own dinero
Zero
You think I'm thinkin' 'bout your ass? (Woo)

[Chorus]
Ask how many nights I've been thinkin' of you
Zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent, but all I got from you
Zero, zero
I thought you were the one (Hey)
Then you turned and run (Hey, oh)
Found somebody better
Like I never met ya (Ooh, yeah)
Ask how many nights I've been thinkin' of you
Zero, zero

[Post-Chorus]
(Zero, zero, zero, zero)
(Zero, zero, zero, zero)
(Zero, zero, zero)
That’s how many fucks I give
(Zero, zero, zero, zero)
(Zero, zero, zero, zero)
(Zero, zero, zero)
That’s how many fucks I give
