[Verse 1: 6LACK]
Hi, my name is 6LACK
And sometimes people call me SIX-LACK
I don't mind because they stubborn
And my bank account is lookin' mighty fine, ayy
We can skip the wine and dine
Go straight for the wind and grind
She wanna cum, I can make it happen, fuck tryin'
Sometimes, I get messy
You can be my biggest secret
I ain't slidin' if you're wit' him
Baby, you gon' have to leave him
I got morals on Sundays
Sometimes on Wednesdays
Really, it depends, but

[Chorus: Jessie Reyez, 6LACK, Both]
You, you're in love with somebody else
Maybe I could offer some help
(Maybe I could offer some help)
Get over them by gettin' under me
But you might O.D. if you get too much of me
Might O.D. if you get too much of me
O.D. if you get too much of me, uh, yeah

What happened here ain't nothing sacred
Shit that got me fucked up is
I know that dude just saw me naked
Nursing a broken heart
But who'd've thought it'd take me ages?
I ended up here 'cause my girl said, "Fake it 'til you make it"
