[Verse 1: SUGA]
Ayy, the heart no longer races
When the music starts to play
Tryna' pull up
Seems like time has stopped
Oh, that would be my first death
I been always afraid of

[Verse 2: RM]
If this can no longer resonate
No longer make my heart vibrate
Then like this may be how
I die my first death
But what if that moment's right now?
Right now

Heartbeat pulsing slow in my ears
Bump, bump, bump
Trying to escape with no avail
Jump, jump, jump
No song affects me anymore
Crying out a silent cry

[Chorus: Jung Kook, Jimin, V, Jin]
Ocean with all light silenced shut, yeah, yeah, yeah
My wandering feet held in a rut, yeah, yeah, yeah
Every noise and sound's been cut, yeah, yeah, yeah
Killin' me now, killin' me now
Do you hear me? Yeah
Sinking slowly like in a trance, nah, nah, nah
Struggle but it's all ocean floor, nah, nah
Every moment becomes eternity, yeah, yeah, yeah
Film it now, film it now
Do you hear me? Yeah

[Post-Chorus: Jimin, V]
Do your thang
Do your thang with me now
Do your thang
Do your thang with me now
What's my thang?
What's my thang? Tell me now
Tell me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
[Verse 3: j-hope]
Deeper, yeah I think I'm goin' deeper
I keep losing focus
Please free me
Let my own feet carry me
But far within
In the deepest depths, I saw myself

[Verse 4: SUGA]
Slowly, I open my eyes
I'm in my workroom, it's my studio
The darkness go darkly in a throe
But I'll never get dragged away again
Inside, I saw myself, myself

[Pre-Chorus: Jung Kook, Jin]
Heartbeat racing in my ears
Bump, bump, bump
Eyes wide open into my forest
Jump, jump, jump
Nothing can devour me
I shout out with ferocity

[Chorus: Jimin, V, Jin, Jung Kook]
Ocean with all light silenced shut, yeah, yeah, yeah
My wandering feet held in a rut, yeah, yeah, yeah
Every noise and sound's been cut, yeah, yeah, yeah
Killin' me now, killin' me now
Do you hear me? Yeah
Sinking slowly like in a trance, nah, nah, nah
Struggle but it's all ocean floor, nah, nah
Every moment becomes eternity, yeah, yeah, yeah
Film it now, film it now
Do you hear me? Yeah
[Post-Chorus: Jin, Jimin]
Do your thang
Do your thang with me now
Do your thang
Do your thang with me now
What's my thang?
What's my thang? Tell me now
Tell me now
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
