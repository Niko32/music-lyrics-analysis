Gary, now I know I was wrong
I messed up and now you're gone
Gary, I'm sorry I neglected you, oh, I never expected you
To run away and leave me feeling this empty
Your meow right now would sound like music to me
Please come home 'cause I miss you, Gary

[Chorus]
(Gary, come home)
Gary, come home
(Gary, come home)

[Verse 2]
Gary, can't you see that I was blind?
I'll do anything to change your mind
More than a pet, you're my best friend
Too cool to forget, come back 'cause we are family
And forgive me for making you wanna roam
And now, my heart is beating like the saddest metronome
Somewhere I hope you're reading my latest three-word poem
"Gary, Come Home"

[Chorus]
(Gary, come home)
Gary, come home
(Gary, come home)
Gary, come home
(Gary, come home)
Gary, come home
(Gary, come home)
Ah, Gary, come home
Gary, come home
Gary, won't you come home?You might also like
