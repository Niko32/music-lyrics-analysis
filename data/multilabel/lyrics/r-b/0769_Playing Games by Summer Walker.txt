Whip, bought it
Crib, got it
Job, on it
Did I ever
Ask you to take me to go
Shopping in Paris or go
Sailing overseas and just
Drape me in Gucci? No
All I ever asked was you to
Pick up the phone when you alone
All I ever asked was you to
Show me some love, kisses and hugs
No, I never had an issue
Go to the club with your boys, baby, I
Never wanted you to stay too long
Just wanted you to show me off

[Chorus]
So won't you say my name, say my name?
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You acting kind of shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go and stop playing games, playing games

[Verse 2]
I know you said, "Hit my line," I'm on your mind, and that
You want this bad
So I'm cool with that
I'm just tryna match your words with your actions
I need more than satisfaction
Is you really 'bout that action?
Really wanna give your all but flex in front of your friends
How that work?
Swear that you doing the most, but we take a picture, can't post it
How that work?
When you talking, back that shit up
Won't you say my, say my
You might also like[Chorus]
So won't you say my name, say my name?
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You acting kind of shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go and stop playing games, playing games

[Outro]
Games, games
Games, oh, games
(We got London on the track)
