Uh, you love the way I pop my top or how I lose my cool
Or how I look at you
Say, why?
It ain't no fightin', no, I can't stop it
This took a while (Yeah)
Love the way I pump my fist or how I bust my hip
For your affection, tryna be down
No fightin' and no stoppin'
Stick around

[Pre-Chorus]
Wish I was the type of girl that you take over to mama
The type of girl, I know my daddy, he'd be proud of (Yeah)
Be proud of (Yeah)
Be proud of, be proud, you know, you know
Wanna be the type of girl you take home to your mama
The type of girl, I know your fellas, they'd be proud of
Be proud of, be proud of, be proud of, boy, you know

[Chorus]
Normal girl, oh
I wish I was a normal girl, oh, my
How do I be, how do I be your baby?
Normal girl, oh
I wish I was a normal girl
I'll never be, no, never be a, oh

"Get it if you want it, I'm waitin', I'm gonna find you
I'm ready to put it on you," yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Type of girl you wanna take home to mama
Wanna be the type of girl, my daddy, he'd be proud of
Be proud of, be proud of, be proud, you know, you know
The type of girl you wanna take her home right up to mama
The kind of girl, I know your fellas, they'd be proud of
I'll be probably, I'll be proud like, I'll be probably a problem
Normal girl, oh, ah

[Chorus]
I really wish I was a normal girl
How do I be, how do I be your baby?
Normal girl, oh
I wish I was a normal girl, oh, babe
I'll never be, no, never be a, oh
[Bridge]
This time next year, I'll be livin' so good
Won't remember your name, I swear
Livin' so good, livin' so good, livin' so good
This time next year, I'll be livin' so good
Won't remember no pain, I swear
Before that you figured out that I was just a normal girl

[Outro]
Normal girl, what do you say now?
Quit on the world 'cause it ain't going your way now
Quit on yourself 'cause you can't figure your way out
Normal girl
How do you be?
