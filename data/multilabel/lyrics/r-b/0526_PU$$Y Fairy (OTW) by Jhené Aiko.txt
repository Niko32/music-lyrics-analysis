I can't wait 'til you come over, I'm not sober, so
You know how it's 'bout to go
'Cause I like to fuck when I'm drunk (Ayy)
I like to suck when I'm drunk (Ayy)
Come on, my baby, what's up? (Sup)
I need you to hurry up, I can't wait, I can't wait
Pussy fairy's on the way (I got pussy on the way)
Ooh, woah (Pussy on the way, put that pussy on my face)
(I got pussy on the way, pussy on the way)
(I got pussy on the way, pussy, pussy on the way)

'Cause I got you sprung off in the springtime
Fuck all your free time
You don't need no me-time
That's you and me time
We be gettin' so loud
That dick make my soul smile
That dick make me so damn proud
Now lay your head down on the pillow
Turn the lights down real low
I want you to say my name
Close your eyes and let your feels go
Now you're gettin' real close
Baby, I am on the way

[Pre-Chorus]
Now that I've got you right here
I won't let you down, down

Don't be surprised, baby, it's just me (Just me)
Don't be surprised, boy, when I bust it wide
I hypnotize you with this pussy (Pussy)
Now you feel like you can fly

I got you sprung off in the springtime
Fuck all your free time

Now lay your head down on the pillow
I'ma fuck you real slow
Need to hear you say my name
Close your eyes and let your feels go
Now you're gettin' real close
Baby, I am on the way
[Pre-Chorus]
Now that I've got you right here
I won't let you down, down

[Chorus]
Don't be surprised, baby, it's just me (Just me)
Don't be surprised, boy, when I bust it wide
I hypnotize you with this pussy (Pussy)
Now you feel like you can fly

Fuck all your free time
You don't need no me-time
