I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la
I'm in love when we are smoking that la-la-la-la-la

[Chorus 1]
Do what you want
(I'm telling youâ€¦) Let me into your heart

[Verse 1]
Can't stand it, backhanded
They wanna see us falling apart
You know that I love you
So let me into you

[Chorus 2]
Let me into your heart
(Do you really love me? I'ma get you, girl, ahhh!)

[Verse 2]
This is the end of us
Sleeping with the moon and the stars
I know where you've been
You can see us far then near
You might also like[Chorus 3]
Let me into your heart
(Oh, this ain't no bullshit, I really love you, girl)
Oh, oh, god
[Bridge]
Girl, you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love
Girl, you really got a hold on me
So this isn't just puppy love
[Outro]
I'm in love when we are smokin' that
(Oh my God, I)
Let me in (Girl, you really got a hold, woo!)
