Ooh, mmh, uh, mmh, mmh
Hey

[Verse 1: Irene, Seulgi, Yeri, Joy]
Who that? Who that? Who that is?
Coming in the back, back talking slick (Uh-huh)
Tell me 'cause I like that, I like that
Yeah, I know what to do with trouble (Uh-huh, uh-huh)
Oh, he don't, he don't, he don't know
I can take 'em head to head, go toe to toe (Toe to toe)
Oh, if you play, I fight back, I fight back
I'll show you who's in control (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus: Wendy, Seulgi]
'Cause I, I know how to make the devil cry (Oh, woah)
Break 'em down, looking in my e-e-eyes
That's what I'm doing here toni-i-ight (Ooh)

[Chorus: All, Joy, Irene]
Every time I come around, 'nother bad boy down
I got 'em like ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Hit 'em with my love like ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
But they come back another round
Just one look from me, lights out, watch 'em hit the ground
Got 'em like ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Hit 'em with my love like ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
I shot another bad boy down
You might also like[Post-Chorus: All, Wendy]
Ooh-woah, oh-oh, ooh-woah, oh-oh
I shot another bad boy down
Ooh-woah, oh-oh
Ooh-woah, oh-woah-oh, oh (Woah)

[Verse 2: Yeri, Wendy, Irene, Joy (Seulgi)]
Put you 'round my finger, I'ma tell you what you wanna hear
Running through your mind, get you hooked, I'll have you shedding tears (Look)
Oh, no, boy, this ain't a fair fight, I'm winning you over, alright
Oh, baby, my apologies (Woop!)
I don't mean to leave you hanging on a string
The more you wanna fight that (Fight that), you fight that (Fight that)
The more I will pull you right back ('Cause I)

[Pre-Chorus: Seulgi, Wendy]
'Cause I, I know how to make the devil cry (Devil cry)
Break 'em down, looking in my e-e-eyes
That's what I'll do to you toni-i-ight (Tonight)

[Chorus: All, Seulgi, Yeri]
Every time I come around (When I come around)
'Nother bad boy down ('Nother bad boy down)
I got 'em like ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Kill 'em with my love like ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
But they come back another round
Just one look from me, lights out, watch them hit the ground
Got 'em like ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Hit 'em with my love like ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
I shot another bad boy down
[Bridge: Wendy, Joy, Seulgi, Irene]
You're gonna know what it feels like, to be free and open your mind
Falling in deep, so hard to breathe, it's only a matter of time
But, baby, I think you should know that I ain't like all the others (Ain't like others)
I'm making you fall, I'm making you fall to your knees

[Chorus: All, Wendy, Seulgi]
Every time I come around, 'nother bad boy down (Ooh)
I got 'em like ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Kill 'em with my love like ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
But they come back another round
Just one look from me, lights out (Just one look from me)
Watch them hit the ground
Got 'em like ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
Kill 'em with my love like ooh-ooh (Oh-eh-oh-eh-oh)
I shot another bad boy down
