If I stay with you, if I'm choosing wrong
I don't care at all
If I'm losing now, but I'm winning late
That's all I want

[Verse 2]
Now we need some space, 'cause I feel for you
And I wanna change
Growing up alone, it seems so short
I can't explain

[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever happens in the future, trust in destiny
Don't try to make anything else even when you feel

[Chorus]
I don't care at all
I am lost
I don't care at all
Lost my time, my life is going on

[Verse 3]
I will be so strong, looking for a new version of myself
Cause now all I want is to be a part of my new world
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Whatever happens in the future, trust in destiny
Don't try to make anything else even when you feel

[Chorus]
I don't care at all
I am lost
I don't care at all
Why not have it all
I am lone
I don't care at all
Lost my time, my life is going on
