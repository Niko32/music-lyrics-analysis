Fuck her, I don't care

[Verse 1: Omarion]
My new lady say she leaving me, ah, fuck her, I don't care
Plus I got another over there
She been wanting to be with me, got her in her underwear
Gave her what she want now she need me
I called more up, they're coming over soon
Lingerie all up in my room
I'ma make this toast to that one girl I love
I still smell her perfume

[Pre-Chorus: Omarion]
(Pour one up) No, pour another
(Pour one up) No, pour another
(Pour one up) No, pour another
Numbing up

[Chorus: Omarion]
Since you've been away
Love's been M.I.A, M.I.A, M.I.A
M.I.A, done looking for love
Cause she took away her
Now I'm M.I.A. (M.I.A) M.I.A
M.I.A (On love, on love)
M.I.A, done looking for love
Cause she took away her love

[Verse 2: Omarion]
My new, my-my new lady say she leaving me
Ah, fuck her I don't care
Told me that she loved me, yeah
I just give them the scenery, they won't ever compare
To the one's who still got it
I call her up but she won't answer
And she knows what I'm looking for
And she knows what I'm looking for, oh
Pour me up

[Pre-Chorus: Omarion]
(Pour one up) No, pour another
(Pour one up) No, pour another
(Pour one up) No, pour me up some
Cause I'm numbing up, hey!

[Chorus: Omarion]
Since you've been away
Love's been M.I.A, M.I.A, M.I.A
M.I.A, done looking for love
Cause she took away her
Now I'm M.I.A. (M.I.A) M.I.A
M.I.A (On love, on love)
M.I.A, done looking for love
Cause she took away her love
[Verse 3: Wale]
I be a rolling stone, missus, still tryna deal with ya
Loving too much'll leave you blue and I ain't pledge Sigma
I'm a, real nigga, giving feelings just ain't me
The more attention you give 'em, the more options they seek
Talk is cheap, knew I shoulda kept the receipt
She said she loyal but all bitches gon' talk in the streets
That's how I play it, how I play it, all it is is game
As I hit another paper plane, I'm M.I.A

[Chorus: Omarion]
Since you've been away
Love's been M.I.A, M.I.A, M.I.A
M.I.A, done looking for love
Cause she took away her
Now I'm M.I.A. (M.I.A) M.I.A
M.I.A (On love, on love)
M.I.A, done looking for love
Cause she took away her love

[Outro: Omarion]
Fuck her, I don't care
