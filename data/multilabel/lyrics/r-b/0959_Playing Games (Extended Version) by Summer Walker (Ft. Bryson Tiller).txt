Whip, bought it
Crib, got it
Job, on it
Did I ever
Ask you to take me to go
Shopping in Paris or go
Sailing overseas and just
Drape me in Gucci? No
All I ever asked was you to
Pick up the phone when you alone
All I ever asked was you to
Show me some love, kisses and hugs
No, I never had an issue
Go to the club with your boys, baby, I
Never wanted you to stay too long
Just wanted you to show me off

[Chorus: Summer Walker]
So won't you say my name, say my name?
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You acting kind of shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go and stop playing games, playing games

[Verse 2: Summer Walker]
I know you said, "Hit my line," I'm on your mind, and that
You want this bad
So I'm cool with that
I'm just tryna match your words with your actions
I need more than satisfaction
Is you really 'bout that action?
Really wanna give your all but flex in front of your friends
How that work?
Swear that you doing the most, but we take a picture, can't post it
How that work?
When you talking, back that shit up
Won't you say my, say my
You might also like[Chorus: Summer Walker & Bryson Tiller]
So won't you say my name, say my name?
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You acting kind of shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go and stop playing games, playing games (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 3: Bryson Tiller]
I blow your mind, honey (Damn)
Say it one time, honey (Goddamn)
Sick of them lies, tell 'em goodbye
Get in my ride, I wanna come by
I wanna just listen, get in your vibe
Get in your feelings, get in your
I get in your feelings, not in your business
I wanna get kissing, I wanna get
I wanna get with you, yeah
I wanna get him out of the picture, yeah
I made it my mission, yeah
Can you spot the difference? Yeah
Me, I'm never acting shady
You will always be my baby
You'll be my baby, yeah, yeah
