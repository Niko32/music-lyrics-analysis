I'ma smoke this joint, then I'ma break you off
I'd be lying if I said you ain't the one
All these tattoos in my skin, they turn you on
Lotta smokin', drinkin'—that's the shit I'm on
Heard you not the type that you take home to Mom
Is we fucking when we leave the club, or nah?
I ain't spending cash for nothing, I wanna see you take it off
I'ma pop this bottle, you gon' give me brain, or nah? (Nah, nah, nah, nah, nah)

[Verse 2: The Weeknd]
Do you like the way I flick my tongue, or nah? (Or nah)
You can ride my face until you're drippin' cum (Drippin' cum)
Can you lick the tip then throat the dick, or nah? (Can you do it, babe?)
Can you let me stretch that pussy out, or nah? (Or nah, or nah)
I'm not the type to call you back tomorrow
But the way you wrapping 'round me is a prob
Ain't nobody tryna save you, baby, get that paper
Probably got a lot of other bitches owe you favors
Pussy so good, had to save that shit for later
Took her to the kitchen, fucked her right there on the table
She repping XO to the death (Ooh, yeah)
I'm tryna make these bitches sweat (Ooh, yeah)
I'm tryna keep that pussy wet (Ooh, yeah)
I'm tryna fuck her and her friends (Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah)
