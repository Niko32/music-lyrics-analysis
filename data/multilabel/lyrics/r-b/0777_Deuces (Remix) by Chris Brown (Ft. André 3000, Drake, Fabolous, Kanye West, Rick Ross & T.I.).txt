K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac

[Verse 1: Chris Brown, Chris Brown & Kevin McCall]
All that bullshit's for the birds
You ain't nothin' but a vulture-ure-ure-ure
Always hoping for the worst
Waitin' for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That know just what I need, she know just what I mean
When I tell her, "Keep it drama free"
Woah-woah
(Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Chu-Chuckin' up them deuces
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Yeah, yeah, told you that I'm leaving, deuces
(Oh-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah)
Woah, woah
I know you mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up

[Verse 2: Drake]
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timin' is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around
You might also like[Verse 3: T.I.]
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ayy, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin', but I guess that you ain't listenin'
Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smokin' like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it's killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, know that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah-ha, didn't you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released
Into the wind again, again
And deuces I must throw ya, peace

[Verse 4: Kanye West]
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, 'cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gon' be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off, they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch (Haha)
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout, “You know who”
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout
[Verse 5: Fabolous, Chris Brown & Fabolous, Drake]
Accordin' to my old bish, I be on some new ish
She was on some old ish, now I got a new bish
Think I give two ish? You ain't gonna do ish
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better, you'd do better
Wanna give the middle finger, but I got two better
So you gon' diss me even though you know it's wrong
Know you gon' miss me a little when I'm gone
Drizzy voice
Now I'm ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I'm 'bout my business, boys, plus I make paper
Come on, that's old news, yesterday's paper (Nice)
Oh, you talkin', what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut your mouth
You'll never score another me, I'll shut it out
Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out

[Verse 6: Rick Ross]
Got a pocket full of hunnids, she the only one that's missin'
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it (Ugh!)
Got a racin' Lamborghini half my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their heads down, they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I'm talkin' ballers slang
R-O-Z-A-Y on the wall in that Hall of Fame (Maybach Music, Ugh!)
I let my denim sag, red Louis belt
How can you love me, baby? First, you gotta love yourself
[Verse 7: André 3000]
The farewell email (Yeah) from a female (Yeah)
But I'm a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details (Ahem)
What it entails is hard to say like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she's not a bore
But neither a whore, who needs to know more
The kind you can't ignore, but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store
And leave with all them shoppin' bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her, ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all that she came for
But enough to know tonight, excited, she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It's hard to throw up the deuces
'Cause when you know it's juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase Cabooses 'til the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs

[Chorus: Chris Brown, Kevin McCall]
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (Deuces)
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye
Say bye-bye
Say bye-bye to her (Deuces)
You made me wanna say bye-bye
Say bye-bye
Say bye-bye to her
