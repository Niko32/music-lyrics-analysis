Special moment in history
Huh
(Romano)
August, no, oh (Oh, oh)
(OG Parker)
(Go)

[Chorus: August Alsina & Rick Ross]
The definition of entanglement (Huh, oh, oh)
It's when you're tangled in the sheets (Yeah, yeah)
Girl, I know that we don't call it a relationship (No, oh, oh)
But you're still fuckin' with me (Oh), yeah (Yeah)
Entanglements is when you tangled in them sheets
Entanglements is when you're tangled up with me
Entanglements (The number one's here) is when you're gettin' in too deep (It's the Biggest)
Tangled up with me (Huh), tang—, tangled in them sheets (Yes)

[Verse 1: Rick Ross]
Shawty leanin' on my shoulder, got her questionin' my willpower
Jaded by her beauty, but her reputation real solid
Moanin' down the hallway, I can tell you how I feel about it
Caught up in the Matrix, and I doubt if I can get up out it (Oh, come on, huh)
Livin' like there's no tomorrow, met your boy with open arms
Told you all my darkest stories, promised that you won't depart
Keys to over forty cars, left me with a broken heart
Still, I gotta get around, favorite artist was 2Pac
W-watch a movie, then we freakin', tangled up, I'm gettin' deeper (Yeah)
Do this shit like every weekend, guess I'm just her little secret (Come on, come on, secret)
Entanglement is when a man'll lick until you tremble (Woo, woo, huh)
S-saddest part is I still love you, just to keep it simple

I'm bein' honest, baby (Biggest), don't want no strings attached (Uh-huh)
You just want a nigga that's gon' break your back (Baby)
In half, no, I ain't 'bout to play with that (Play with that)
You left your man to fuck with me just to pay him back
Don't you know that's cold-hearted?
Once you gone, no comin' back
Girl, you're fuckin' with a youngin', I be doin' shit he lack
Don't do no talkin' when I see you, all you hear is love sounds
Goin' round for round, you want a nigga to take you down (It's a special moment in history)

[Chorus: August Alsina & Rick Ross]
The definition of entanglement (Yes)
It's when you're tangled in the sheets (It's when you tangled in the sheets, yeah)
Girl, I know that we don't call it a relationship (No, oh, oh)
But you're still fuckin' with me (Oh), yeah (Yeah)
Entanglements is when you tangled in them sheets
Entanglements is when you're tangled up with me
Entanglements is when you're gettin' in too deep
Tangled up with me, tang—, tangled in them sheets (Brrt)

[Verse 3: August Alsina]
I'm on my way, yeah (Skrr)
I'ma pull up when he dip (Skrr)
He always think me and you fuckin' (Woo)
If he see me, he gon' trip
Let's be lowkey (Key, key)
Girl, I know I fucked up your hair
Lay you down, and hit it right there
Lay you down, and hit it right there, oh, oh
That ain't my girl, but I got the key (Oh)
To the crib and to your car (To the crib and to her heart)
She don't wanna label shit, but she needs me in her life (In her life, yeah)
I don't have to label shit to fit it in her life, life, lifestyle
We gon' keep it poppin', shawty, you my lil' secret (You my lil' secret)
Sex in the lingerie or I ain't takin' off next weekend
Know it's wrong, but it feels right (It feels so right, yeah)
Know it's wrong, but it feels right, girl
[Chorus: August Alsina]
The definition of entanglement (No, oh, oh)
It's when you're tangled in the sheets (Yeah)
Girl, I know that we don't call it a relationship (Woah, ooh, ooh, ooh)
But you're still fuckin' with me (But you're still fuckin' with me), yeah
Entanglements (Entanglements), is when you tangled in them sheets (Is when you tangled in them sheets)
Entanglements is when you're tangled up with me
Entanglements (Entanglements) is when you're gettin' in too deep
Tangled up with me, tang—, tangled in them sheets
