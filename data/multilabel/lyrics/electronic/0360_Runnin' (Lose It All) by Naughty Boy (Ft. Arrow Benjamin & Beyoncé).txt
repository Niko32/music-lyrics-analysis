These four lonely walls have changed the way I feel
The way I feel, I'm standing still
And nothing else matters now, you're not here
So where are you? I've been callin' you, I'm missin' you

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Where else can I go? Where else can I go?
Chasin' you, chasin' you
Memories turn to dust, please don't bury us
I got you, I got you

[Chorus: Beyoncé]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
I'm ready to face it all

[Post-Chorus: Beyoncé]
If I lose myself, I lose it all

[Verse 2: Arrow Benjamin]
I've outrun the fears that chased, they're standin' still
I'm runnin' still, I'm runnin' still
And every voice that cried inside my head, forever drives
Forever drives, I've killed the lights, oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Arrow Benjamin]
Where else can I go? And where else can I go?
Chasing you, chasing you, oh

[Chorus: Arrow Benjamin, Beyoncé]
Runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
Together we'll win it all
I ain't runnin', runnin', runnin', runnin'
Runnin', runnin', runnin'
Ain't runnin' from myself no more
I'm ready to face it all

[Post-Chorus: Arrow Benjamin, Beyoncé]
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
If I lose myself, I lose it all
