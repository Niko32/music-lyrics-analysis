The world is spinning too fast
I'm buying lead Nike shoes
To keep myself tethered
To the days I've tried to lose
My mama said to slow down
You must make your own shoes
Stop dancing to the music
Of Gorillaz in a happy mood

[Pre-Chorus: 2-D]
Keeping my groove on
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
Oh, yeah
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump

[Chorus: Noodle]
Here you go! Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine

There's a monkey in the jungle
Watching a vapor trail
Caught up in the conflict
Between its brain and its tail
And if time's elimination
Then we got nothing to lose
Please repeat the message
It's the music that we choose

[Pre-Chorus: 2-D]
Keeping my groove on
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
Oh, yeah
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump

[Interlude]
Okay, bring it down here
We goin' back out

[Chorus: Noodle]
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
Get the cool
Get the cool shoeshine
[Outro: 2-D]
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
They do the bump
