I can love you desperately
Though your love ain't guaranteed
Oh, I wish you knew the deal
Gotta learn from far away
And I simply needed space
Space for me to be
And I think you need it too
Though I know you call me selfish for assuming
I did this for you too
You still got me round your finger
Even though I'm far away
Please believe me when I say:

[Chorus]
Everything I do, I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make, I only make for you
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise one day I'll come back for you

[Verse 2]
Oh, you say you hate me now and you burn me with your words
Calling me a fool
Saying that I've fucked up everything
And you'll never forgive me
Though I'm doing this for you
Baby, can't you see if there is such a thing
Of loving someone so much that you need to give them time to let them breathe
But you don't understand
I wish you understood
Oh, I hope one day you do
You might also like[Chorus]
Everything I do, I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make, I only make for you
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise one day I'll come back for you

[Bridge]
Believe in you, believe in me
We're meant to be together
I told you, weren't lying, I know you aren't relying
And now I am supplying you
The time and space to let you grow
Into the person that I know, that I know you could be
And I can be her too and I'll come back to you
When I'm ready for you, baby, I ain't ready for you now
I'm not ready for you now, please don't hate me

[Chorus]
Everything I do, I'm gonna think of you
Don't know what else to do
You got me, you got me, baby
Everything I make, I only make for you
Baby, be patient for me
And please don't fall in love with someone new
I promise one day I'll come back to you
[Outro]
I promise, one day, I'll come back to you
I promise one day, I'll come back to you
I promise, baby, one day I'll come back to you
I promise, baby, one day I'll come back to you
