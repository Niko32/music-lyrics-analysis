I got her in the palm of my hand
She knows I love her
I got her, thought I lost her again

[Verse 1]
But life's so quick sometimes
Just blink and you might miss it when you close your eyes
It's been a while since we kicked it but the answer's on her lips tonight
[Chorus]
I got her in the palm of my hand
She knows I love her
I got her, thought I lost her again, ooh

[Verse 2]
I'm on the way
To finding out exactly how to treat her right
Another day and I've been waiting
But I've been waiting my whole life to find
Someone like her
[Chorus]
I got her in the palm of my hand
She knows I love her
I got her, thought I lost her again, ooh
You might also like[Verse 3]
I'm glad we made it this far
Sometimes you just don't know
So many days spent apart but now
I'm finally yours (So won't you)

[Bridge]
Move my body, do it right
Left, right, side, side
Not about to waste my time waiting all night
Move my body, do it right
Left, right, side, side
Not about to waste my time waiting all night
[Chorus]
I got her in the palm of my hand
She knows I love her
I got her, thought I lost her again, ooh
[Outro]
She knows I got her
She knows I love her
She knows I love her
She knows I love her
She knows, she does
But it's cool because
It's me she loves
She knows, she does
