I remember us alone
Waiting for the light to go
Don't you feel that hunger?
I've got so many secrets to show
When I saw you on that stage
I shivered with the look you gave
Don't you hear that rhythm?
Can you show me how we can escape?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I was biting my tongue, I was trying to hide
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'll forget what I've done, I will be redefined

[Chorus]
It's shaking the sky, and I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alight
Don't leave me behind
Can you see me? I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find

[Post-Chorus]
I'm holding it all tonight
Unfolding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight
Unfolding it all tonight
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find
You might also like[Verse 2]
Now that we can hear that sound
Now that you can hold me down
You can pull me under
You can raise everything to the ground
Everything I can arrange
Every part of me you change
Just hold me together
Tell me you'll always want me to stay

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I was biting my tongue, I was trying to hide
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'll forget what I've done, I will be redefined

[Chorus]
It's shaking the sky, and I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alight
Don't leave me behind
Can you see me? I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find

[Bridge]
Wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one that your love
That your love can heal
I wanna be the one you steal
I wanna be the one you shield
I wanna be the one that your love, that your love
[Chorus]
It's shaking the sky, and I'm following lightning
I'll recover if you keep me alight
Don't leave me behind
Can you see me? I'm shining
And it's you that I've been waiting to find

[Post-Chorus]
I'm holding it all tonight (Tonight)
Unfolding it all tonight (Tonight)
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find
I'm holding it all tonight (Tonight)
Unfolding it all tonight (Tonight)
You know that you make it shine
It's you that I've been waiting to find

[Outro]
(Tonight) Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Tonight)
It's you that I've been waiting to find
(Tonight) Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Tonight)
It's you that I've been waiting to find
