Keep your voice down
And stop looking at my friends
Blow out
They can hear exactly what you say
[Pre-Chorus]
Drink, fuck, spew
Telephone you
If you're alone in your room
What's that boy doing?

[Chorus]
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending

[Verse 2]
Can we go now?
Not staying 'til the end
Fall down
Write another song about your friends

[Bridge]
Lock me in, knock me out
Talking like you do
And if you think you're helping me
I don't think I'm helping you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Drink, fuck, spew
Telephone you
If you're alone in your room
What's that boy doing?

[Chorus]
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
