I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I wanted to know
Tell me things that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun

[Verse: Chet Faker]
Hush, I said there's more to life than rush
Not gonna leave this place with us
Drop the game, it's not enough
Hush, I said there's more to life than rush
Not gonna leave this place with us
Drop the game, it's not enough (Things that you've done)

[Chorus: Chet Faker]
I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I wanted to know
Tell me things that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun
I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I wanted to know
Tell me things that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun (Things that you've done)
I've been seeing all, I've been seeing your soul
Give me things that I wanted to know
Tell me things that you've done
I've been feeling old, I've been feeling cold
You're the heat that I know
Listen, you are my sun (Things that you've done)You might also like
