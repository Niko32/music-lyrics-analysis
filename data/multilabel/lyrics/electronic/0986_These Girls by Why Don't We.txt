I've been all through the country
From L.A. to Kentucky
Met a good girl in Houston but she knows
That there are bad girls in Paris
Know they wanna get married
And some beautiful ones in Tokyo

[Pre-Chorus: Jack Avery]
Some go to college, some go to model
Some diggin' for that gold
Some flying solo, some wanna stay at home

[Chorus: Zach Herron & Jonah Marais & All]
Ooh, I want 'em all (These girls)
The ones that you bring home to momma (These girls)
And the ones who love all of the drama (These girls)
I swear there's way too many, tryna fall for one
But I can't help it, I just wanna love all these girls
The independent ones with money (These girls)
The crazy ones that love to party (These girls)
I swear there's way too many, tryna fall for one
But I can't help it, I just wanna love all

[Refrain: Daniel Seavey & Jonah Marais]
Hollywood girls, tryna be like Rihanna
And I can't choose one I just gotta be honest
Oh, I don't know how to decide
Too many girls on my mind
Too many girls, all be fine
You might also like[Chorus: Zach Herron & Jonah Marais & All]
Ooh, I want 'em all (These girls)
The ones that you bring home to momma (These girls)
And the ones who love all of the drama (These girls)
I swear there's way too many, tryna fall for one
But I can't help it, I just wanna love all these girls
The independent ones with money (These girls)
The crazy ones that love to party (These girls)
I swear there's way too many, tryna fall for one
But I can't help it, I just wanna love all

[Refrain: Daniel Seavey & Jonah Marais]
Hollywood girls, tryna be like Rihanna
And I can't choose one I just gotta be honest
Oh, I don't know how to decide
Too many girls on my mind
Too many girls, all be fine

[Bridge: Zach Herron & Corbyn Besson]
Ooh, I want 'em all

But I can't help it, I just wanna love

[Chorus: Zach Herron & Jonah Marais & All]
All these girls
The ones that you bring home to momma (These girls)
And the ones who love all of the drama (These girls)
I swear there's way too many, tryna fall for one
But I can't help it, I just wanna love all these girls
The independent ones with money (These girls)
The crazy ones that love to party (These girls)
I swear there's way too many, tryna fall for one
But I can't help it, I just wanna love all
