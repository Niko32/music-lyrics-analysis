No limit in the sky that I won't fly for ya (For ya)
No amount of tears in my eyes that I won't cry for ya, ooh no
With every breath that I take
I want you to share that air with me
There's no promise that I won't keep
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart when it comes to you
Comes to you

[Drop: Justin Bieber]
Want you to share that
When it comes to you

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]
Cupid ain't a lie, arrow got your name on it, ooh, yeah
Don't miss out on a love and regret yourself on it, ooh (Ooh)
Open up your mind, clear your head
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed
Share my life, it's yours to keep
Now that I give to you all of me, ooh
You might also like[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you, there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you, don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart when it comes to you
Comes to you

[Drop: Justin Bieber]
Want you to share that
(Share)
When it comes to you
Want you to share that

[Chorus: Justin Bieber]
When it comes to you (to you), there's no crime
Let's take both of our souls, and intertwine
When it comes to you (to you), don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart when it comes to you
Comes to you
