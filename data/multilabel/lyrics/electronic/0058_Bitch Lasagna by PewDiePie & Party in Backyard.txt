I don't like you, T-Series
Nothing personal, kid
But I must go all out
Just this once

[Verse 1]
Bobs or vegana, whichever will it be?
Sit the fuck down, T-Series, I'm here to spill the real tea (Uh)
You tryna dethrone me from spot on number one
But you, India, you lose, so best think you haven't won
When I'm through with you, we're gonna be completely fuckin' done
'Cause we only just begun, I review you: *clap clap*
Zero, bye bitch, gone
So come on, T-Series, looking hungry for some drama
Here, let me serve you bitch lasagna

[Chorus]
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series, they just crying for their mama
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series just wet themselves in their pajamas

So who the hell is Bob and why you wanna kiss him? (Ew)
I'm a Blue-Eyes White Dragon while you're just Dark Magician (Oof)
You got a fifth of the population in your nation, but
I got nine-year-olds of worlds so hold your defecation (Oops)
Motu Patlu, what the fuck is that even supposed to mean?
Your language sounds like it comes from a mumble rap community
No papa, no papa, yes papa; Johny
Now down all of this sugar and let's throw this fuckin' party with someâ€”

[Chorus]
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series, they're just crying for their mama
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
Look at T-Series, they just wetting their pajamas
Bitch lasagna, bitch lasagna
T-Series ain't nothing but a bitch lasagna

[Outro]
You got a population of one point three-two billion
But most your videos can't seem to hit even a million
Sub-bot!
