Yeah, I know, know I'm scared of commitment
But tell me who isn't, tell me who isn't
I know, it's easier being alone

[Pre-Chorus]
But when you come over again
I'm not gonna pretend I want anyone else 'cause I don't
I'm tired of being alone

[Chorus]
I wanna stay with you, you, you
Make love all day with you, you, you
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through
I wanna stay with you, you, you
Make love all day with you, you, you
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through
I wanna stay with

[Post-Chorus]
Stay with, with

[Verse 2]
So let's start where we left
We can lay in my bed but we won't go to bed
No we won't
I'm not one for taking it slow
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
So when you come again and again
With the sheets in your hand
You can't even pretend that you don't
Love how I make you moan

[Chorus]
I wanna stay with you, you, you
Make love all day with you, you, you
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through
I wanna stay with you, you, you
Make love all day with you, you, you
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through
I wanna stay with

[Post-Chorus]
Stay with, with
Ooh, stay
Stay with
With you

[Bridge]
Stay with you
Stay with you
Stay with you
I'm not looking for something new
[Chorus]
I wanna stay with you, you, you
Make love all day with you, you, you
Stay sipping champagne with you, you, you
If you wanna do drugs, come through, through, through
I wanna stay with you, yeah

[Post-Chorus]
Stay with, with
Ooh, stay
Stay with
Ooh, with you
