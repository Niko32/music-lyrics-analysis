Yeah, that body's a blessin', girl
I ain't tryna pressure her (no, no, no, no)
She messed with the temperature
Heart wrote the song, but I am the messenger
Through the metropolis
There is no stoppin' this (no, no, no, no)
Flowers and kisses, yeah
I heard you like chocolate
Light up the candles
Tune up this channel
It's the ride of your life, girl
My room is Orlando
Bruce G the man, though
How much can you handle?
I go commando (oh)
That body so blanco

[Verse 2]
And I'm bout dive in it, straight to bottom
'Cause there is no toppin' this, pop lock and drop
On your man if you coppin' it, baby
I fall for these tropical ladies
I know that she wavy, she naughty, she crazy, she got it
She got it all on me – the road is wide open
And callin', I flow like a Lambo
My boo's a Bugatti, I live like a movie
Young opportunist used to make changes
To hang with the coolest, but now I'm the coolest
That dude that will do it, that dude who will fuel
The movement, watch as I do this
I'm good in my lane though
Hand in my hand, no letting go
On top of my game, yeah, on top of my game
I play with an angel

I'm grateful
Thank you for the things you do and say to keep me faithful
Thank you for the time you take to keep my heart from danger
Funny how one stranger stepped in, made up all these changes
For the better

[Chorus 1]
Oh, baby, yeah, I'm grateful
Grateful, oh, baby, yeah, I'm grateful
I'm grateful, oh, baby, yeah, I'm grateful
Grateful, oh, baby, yeah, I'm grateful
I'm grateful (oh lord), yeah

[Verse 3]
I don't really do this but
Bruce G be the dude to remove the bluff
Fake chick wanna talk like she knew what's up
Every time I step in they say, "Who the what?" –
"The where, the how?", fly nigga smear the ground
My chick 10/10, she could steer the sound
From miles away – Hello felt kinda gay
Now goodbyes feel like a tidal wave

[Chorus 2]
You must be three if you ain't the one
'Cause I know three words to replace the sun
Oh, girl, oh, girl, you make 'em run
Oh, girl, oh, girl, you make 'em run
You must be three if you ain't the one
'Cause I know three words to replace the sun
Oh, girl, oh, girl, you make 'em run
Oh, girl, oh, girl, you make 'em run
[Verse 4]
Yeah, this trust never trippin' up
This love ever livin' up
Never had to flex for you
Get fresh, catch a bus just to hit you up
Got me on speed dial
Just press 1 if you really need me now
Press 4 if you miss me
Press 3 and I'll...
