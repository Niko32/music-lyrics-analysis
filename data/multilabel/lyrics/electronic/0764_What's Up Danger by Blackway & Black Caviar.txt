Two thousand on thermometers
Two thousand surroundin' us
Travel two thousand kilometers to hang out with us
What's up, danger? (Danger)
What's up, danger? (Danger)
Ayy, didn't know they doubted us
Makes it that more marvelous
Sign 'em up, 'cause ominous vibes and I get synonymous
What's up, danger?
Ayy, don't be a stranger
'Cause I like high chances that I might lose (Lose)
I like it all on the edge just like you, ayy
I like tall buildings so I can leap off of 'em
I go hard wit' it no matter how dark it is

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm insane but on my toes
I could keep the world balanced on my nose
I had a slumber party wit' all my foes
Now I wear them like a badge of honor on my clothes
If I'm crazy, I'm on my own
If I'm waitin', it's on my throne
If I sound lazy, just ignore my tone
'Cause I'm always gonna answer when you call my phone
You might also like[Chorus]
Like what's up, danger? (Danger)
Like what's up, danger? (Danger)
Don-don't be a stranger
What's up, danger?

[Verse 2]
Two hundred miles per hour wit' a blindfold on (On)
Momma always askin', "Where did I go wrong?" (Wrong)
What's up, danger?
Ah, what's up, danger?
Traveled two hundred miles, I'm knockin' at your door
And I don't really care if you ain't done wrong, come on
What's up, danger? (Danger)
Don't be a stranger (Stranger)
I like it when trouble brews, I won’t dare change
I like it when there’s turbulence on my airplanes
I like it when I sense things that I can’t see yet
Swimmin' with sharks when they ain't feed yet
'Cause I like high chances that I might lose
I like it all on the edge just like you, ayy
I like tall buildings so I can leap off of 'em
I go hard wit' it no matter how dark it is

[Bridge]
Ooh
Ooh
[Pre-Chorus]
If I'm crazy, I'm on my own
If I'm waitin', it's on my throne
If I sound lazy, just ignore my tone
'Cause I'm always gonna answer when you call my phone

[Chorus]
Like what's up, danger? (Danger)
Like what's up, danger? (Danger)

[Outro]
Can't stop me now
I said, "I got you now"
I'm right here at your door
I won't leave, I want more
What's up, danger?
Yeah, what's up, danger?
Can't stop me now, yeah
I said I got you now
Come on, what's up, danger?
Come on, I said, "What's up, danger?"
