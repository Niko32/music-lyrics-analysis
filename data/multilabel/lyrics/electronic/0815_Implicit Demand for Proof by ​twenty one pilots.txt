[Verse 1]
I know You're not a liar and I know You could set fire this day
Go ahead and make me look away
Strike me down, I am calling Your lightning down from Your dark hiding place
Go ahead and show me Your face

[Chorus]
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down (Reign down)

[Verse 2]
I mean no disrespect
I am simply very perplexed by Your ways
Why would you let us use your name?

[Chorus]
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me
Reign down and destroy me

[Outro]
Reign down (Down!)
Reign down (Down!)
(Down! Down! Reign!)You might also like
