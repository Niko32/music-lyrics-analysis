G
Bebe, I got ya

[Verse 1: Bebe Rexha]
Friends come and go, friends come and go, go like the seasons
I never know, I never know what to believe in
And it's getting old, it's getting old, but no hard feelings
'Cause friends come and go, friends come and go without a reason

[Refrain: Bebe Rexha]
And I, I've been in L.A. for way too long
Can't get this air inside my lungs
It feels like I'm suffocatin' from
All the lack of the realness here

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Is there anybody real out here?
Got my middle, middle up while I'm singing

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha, G-Eazy]
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
I've had it up to the ceiling
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind (Yeah)
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends

And lately I've been dealin' with mad stress
Comes with the territory of a Hollywood address
Is anybody real here? I need some fact checks
I need more realness, need you to act less
'Cause they deserve Oscars, so many imposters
What's up with guest lists? Can I come to your concerts?
We all got demons, I'm dealin' with monsters
I've taken every picture, signed titties and signed shirts
But at the same time I know I'm blessed to be here
So let's just be clear, a million kids wish they had the spot I got
Success is not a sandy beach chair
Be careful with the people you meet here, I'm sayin'
Uh, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha, G-Eazy]
Is there anybody real out here? (G)
Got my middle, middle up while I'm singing (Eeh, uh)

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha, G-Eazy]
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving (Yeah)
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
I've had it up to the ceiling
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends
[Post-Chorus: G-Eazy, Bebe Rexha]
(Yeah)
We don't need 'em
(Bebe, you know I feel you)

[Bridge: Bebe Rexha]
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
Say it to my face, don't pretend
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
Say it to my face, don't pretend
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends

[Pre-Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Is there anybody real out here?
Got my middle, middle up while I'm singing

[Chorus: Bebe Rexha]
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
I've had it up to the ceiling
Fuck fake friends, we don't need 'em
Only thing they're good for is leaving
And I ain't got the time, money on my mind
I'll say it to your face, fuck fake friends
