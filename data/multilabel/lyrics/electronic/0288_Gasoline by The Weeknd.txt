It's 5 AM my time again
I've soakin' up the moon, can't sleep
It's 5 AM my time again
I'm calling and you know it's me
I'm pushin' myself further
I'm just tryin' to feel my heartbeat beat (Beat)
I wrap my hands around your neck
You love it when I always squeeze
It's 5 AM, I'm high again
And you can see that I'm in pain (Ooh, ooh)
I've fallen into emptiness
I want you 'cause we're both insane
I'm staring into the abyss
I'm lookin' at myself again
I'm dozing off to R.E.M.
I'm trying not to lose my faith

[Chorus]
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me
I know you won't let me OD
And if I finally die in peace
Just wrap my body in these sheets (Sheets)
And pour out the gasolinе
It don't mean much to me

It's 5 AM, I'm nihilist
I know therе's nothing after this (After this)
Obsessing over aftermaths
Apocalypse and hopelessness (Hopelessness)
The only thing I understand
Is zero sum of tenderness (Tenderness)
Oh, baby, please, just hold me close
Make me believe there's more to live

[Bridge]
Around, around, around, around we go
In this game called life, we are not free

[Chorus]
And I love it when you watch me sleep
You spin me 'round so I can breathe
It's only safe for you and me (Don't let me go)
I know you won't let me OD (Don't you let me go)
And if I finally die in peace (Oh yeah)
Just wrap my body in these sheets
And pour out the gasoline
It don't mean much to me
