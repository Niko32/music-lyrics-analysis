He won't make love to me now
Not now I've set the fee
He said it's too much in pound
I guess I'm stuck with me

[Refrain]
He told me I was so small
I told him, "Water me"
I promise I can grow tall
When making love is free

[Verse]
He won't make love to me now
Not now I've set the fee
He said it's too much in pound
I guess I'm stuck with me

[Outro]
He told me I was so small
I told him, "Water me"You might also like
