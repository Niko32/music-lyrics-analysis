You're in my mind when I'm asleep
I'm seeing stars sink in these dreams
I don't wanna spend these hours with nobody else
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
I'm in your mind, you're in my dreams
I'm freaking out, I don't wanna leave
But so selfishly, I want you and nobody else

[Pre-Chorus: Yves, Chuu]
I can't deny it, I lose, I lose my head
Fight it, I do, I do
I can't deny it, I lose, I lose all my mind

[Chorus: Yeojin, (Go Won), Hyunjin, Choerry, (Vivi), Jinsoul]
Starlight, starlight
With you shining in my mind (Ooh-aah)
Shine a light all through the night
Close to me, you are all of me
I'm seeing star lights, star lights
Us against the sunrise (Sunrise)
Shine a light all through the night
Close to me, you are all of me

[Verse 2: Olivia Hye, Kim Lip, Vivi]
These nights go by, they're falling fast
Here in a moment, gone in a flash
I'd stop the world to know everything is okay
(Hey, hey, hey, hey)
'Cause we're running and running, it makes me nervous
We're almost for sure, but we've scratched the surface
So close to perfect, it hurts to throw it away

I can't deny it, I lose, I lose my head
Fight it, I do, I do
I can't deny it, I lose, I lose all my mind

[Chorus: Kim Lip, (Olivia Hye), Yeojin, Go Won, (Vivi), Chuu]
Starlight, starlight
With you shining in my mind (Ooh-aah)
Shine a light all through the night
Close to me, you are all of me
I'm seeing star lights, star lights
Us against the sunrise (Sunrise)
Shine a light all through the night
Close to me, you are all of me

[Post-Chorus: Vivi, Hyunjin]
Close to me, you are all of me
Close to me, you are all of me

[Bridge: Choerry, Chuu]
'Cause we're running and running, it makes me nervous
We're almost for sure, but we've scratched the surface
So close to perfect, it hurts to throw it away

[Chorus: Olivia Hye, (Yves), Heejin]
Starlight, starlight
We keep shining in my mind (Ooh-aah)
Shine a light all through the night
Close to me, you are all of me
[Post-Chorus: Go Won]
Close to me, you are all of me
