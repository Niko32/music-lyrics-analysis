But it's all the same, I could have foreseen
That you would act like you are
Oh, so cool you seem, blending with that scene
Wearing what you think is hard

[Chorus]
I can see you struggling, boy, don't hurt your brain
Thinking what you're gonna say
'Cause everything's a game, always tryna calculate
Trying to look smart, but not too smart to threaten anything they say

[Verse]
But it's all the same, I could have foreseen
That you would act like you are
Oh, so cool you seem, blending with that scene
Wearing what you think is hard

[Chorus]
I can see you struggling, boy, don't hurt your brain
Thinking what you're gonna say
'Cause everything's a game, always tryna calculate
Trying to look smart, but not too smart to threaten everything they sayYou might also like
