Want is the cigarette smoke on a jacket
You wore to the wrong part of town
Desire is the sound of the whiskey
Telling me you miss me, can you come around?

[Pre-Chorus]
Passion is a passing thing
It's accidental chemistry
Lust is a liar, a short-lived fire
It ain't what you and I are at all

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a need, it's a need
I would go anywhere that you lead
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow
Touch me, hold me, tell me, "I won't let you go"
I won't leave, it's a need

[Verse 2]
Danger is a thousand prickles on my neck
That tell me to run or to freeze
Fear is the nightmare I had, you were with someone else
You forgot about me

[Pre-Chorus]
Passion is a passing thing
It's accidental chemistry
Caught up in a feeling, it can be deceiving
This is like breathing for me
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, it's a need, it's a need
I would go anywhere that you lead
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow
Touch me, hold me, tell me, "I won't let you go"
I won't leave, it's a need

[Bridge]
Baby, it's always a new kiss every time we do this
The truth is it's essential to me
That you love me more than wishing, longing

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a need (It's a need), it's a need (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
I would go (I would go) anywhere (Anywhere) that you lead (Oh, oh)
I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow (Burning slow)
Touch me, hold me, tell me, "I won't let you go"
I won't leave (I won't leave), it's a need (Oh)
