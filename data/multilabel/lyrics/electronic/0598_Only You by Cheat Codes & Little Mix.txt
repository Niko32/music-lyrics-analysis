Dancing with your silhouette in the places that we met
Ooh, tryna find you in the moon
Paris never feels the same when the streets all call your name
Ooh, so I hide in crowded rooms

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne]
And I'll follow right down the river
Where the ocean meets the sky
To you, to you

[Chorus: Jade]
Once upon a time, we had it all
Somewhere down the line, we went and lost it
One brick at a time, we watched it fall
I'm broken here tonight and, darling, no one else can fix me
Only you, only you
Oh, no one else can fix me, only you
Only you, only you
Oh, no one else can fix me, only you, oh

[Post-Chorus: Jade]
Only you

[Verse 2: Jesy & Trevor, Jesy & Trevor & Leigh-Anne]
Did I let go of your hand for a castle made of sand?
Ooh, that fell into the blue
I went following the sun to be alone with everyone
Ooh, looking 'round a crowded room
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne & Trevor]
And I'll follow right down the river
Where the ocean meets the sky
To you, to you

[Chorus: All, Trevor, Jade, Jesy, *Perrie & Trevor*]
Once upon a time, we had it all (We had it all; Mmm)
Somewhere down the line, we went and lost it (We went and lost it)
One brick at a time, we watched it fall (Fall)
I'm broken here tonight and, darling, no one else can fix me
Only you, only you (Yeah)
Oh, no one else can fix me, only you (Only you, yeah)
Only you (Nobody else), only you (Oh)
Oh, no one else can fix me, only you, *oh*

[Post-Chorus: Jade & Leigh-Anne, Perrie]
Only you
Falling, falling, falling, yeah

[Outro: All, Trevor, Perrie]
Only you (Only you), only you (Only you)
Oh, no one else can fix me, only you (Only you)
Only you (Oh; Only you), only you (Only you)
Oh, no one else can fix me, only you
