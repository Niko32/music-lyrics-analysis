All my friends are witches and we live in Hollywood
Mystical bitches makin' our own sisterhood
Whilst society is fallin', we are quietly reformin'
Protectin' the planet, healin' our own damage
Quarantined, all alone, Mother Nature's on the phone
"What have you been doin'? Don't forget, I am your home
Virus come, fires burn, until human beings learn
From every disaster, you are not my master"

[Pre-Chorus]
Need to purge the poison, show us our humanity
All the bad and good, racism and misogyny
Nothing's hidden anymore, capitalism made us poor
God, forgive America for every single war

[Chorus]
Need to purge the poison from our system
Until human beings listen
Tell me, who'd you think you are?
It's your own decision
But your home is now your prison
You forgot that without me, you won't go far

[Post-Chorus]
Need to purge the poison from our system
Until human beings listen
Tell me, who'd you think you are?

2007, when size zero was the rage⁣⁣⁣
Britney shaved her head and all we did was call her crazed⁣⁣⁣
Harvey Weinstein gone to jail⁣⁣⁣, MeToo went on to unveil⁣⁣⁣
Truth and all its glory⁣⁣, the ending of a story⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

[Pre-Chorus]
It's a New World Order⁣, everything just falls away⁣
Our life as we knew it now belongs to yesterday
Inside all the love and hate, we can now regenerate
Stop how we'd been livin' every single day

[Chorus]
Need to purge the poison from our system
Until human beings listen
Tell me, who'd you think you are?
It's your own decision
But your home is now your prison
You forgot that without me, you won't go far

[Post-Chorus]
Need to purge the poison from our system
Until human beings listen
Tell me, who'd you think you are?

[Bridge]
I just want a world where I can see the feminine
We only make up one quarter of the government
Like an angel gone to hell, cast a moon under our spell
Ownin' female power, takin' back what's ours
[Pre-Chorus]
Earth is like a white rose, quiet cloud of petals cold
A place so corrupt where angel flesh and blood is sold
The feminine is born as new, studded with a diamond dew
Saw the dawn was comin', everybody knew

[Chorus]
Need to purge the poison from our system
Until human beings listen
Tell me, who'd you think you are?
It's your own decision
But your home is now your prison
You forgot that without me, you won't go far
Need to purge the poison from our system
Until human beings listen
Tell me, who'd you think you are?
It's your own decision
But your home is now your prison
You forgot that without me, you won't go far
