Snakehips

[Verse 1]
I tell all Spanish bitches, "dímelo"
She say it's for her and not for me to know
She always wanna know why I don't let her roll
So shit, just say for you it's just for me to know
I said the faces in my Rollie never tick tock
Stacking paper 'til it's at the tip top (Tip it)
I know why they mad, 'cause my shit pop
Driving to success so fuck a pit stop
Swear I did it all for some Adidas
I'm the one that said fuck any non-believers
Homeboy, I know you love to think you fucking wit' me
Just keep it real my G, who really run the city?
Fargo got 'em bunch of bitches in the Caravan
Step off in your bitches like a pair of Vans
Damn this white bitch with me look like Marilyn
My life just like a movie that could never end

[Refrain]
And it's all in one night, since everyone around
We brought everyone up out of their home for one night
So let's get right
You might also like[Chorus]
I got Hispanic bitches yelling dímelo
I'm the one that's living shit la vida loca
Toastin' to my niggas 'cause we finally made it
Crazy, we did everything we dreamed of

[Post-Chorus]
I know I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Put your hands up if you deserve it
I know I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Put your hands up if you deserve it

[Verse 2]
Tell them niggas drop a O in a ziplock
Tell the competition, wait
I forgot, no competition, I got shit locked
I got big plans for some big guap
Girl, these niggas sayin I'll be rich
I been plotting on that shit since '96
If I go reaching for a fail, I'll probably miss
The realest song up of the year is probably this
I see these niggas talk so down 'bout a nigga, man
But you know that I'm rich and I don't give a damn
I'm ridin' 'round the town in that 911
And she say she don't want this shit to ever end
[Refrain]
And it's all in one night, since everyone around
We brought everyone up out of their home for one night
So let's get right

[Chorus]
I got Hispanic bitches yelling dímelo
I'm the one that's living shit la vida loca
Toasting to my niggas 'cause we finally made it
Crazy, we did everything we dreamed of

[Post-Chorus]
I know I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Put your hands up if you deserve it
I know I deserve it, I know I deserve it
Put your hands up if you deserve it
