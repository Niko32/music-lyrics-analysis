Young ambition
Say we'll go slow, but we never do
Premonition
See me spendin’ every night with you

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Oh, yeah, under the kitchen lights
You still look like dynamite
And I wanna end up on you
Oh, don't need no place to go
Just put on the radio
You know what I wanna do

[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
We can just dance to this
Don't take much to start me
We can just dance to this
Push up on my body, yeah
You know we’ve already seen all of the parties
We can just dance to this
We can just, we can just dance to this

[Post-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Dance to this
We can just dance to this
