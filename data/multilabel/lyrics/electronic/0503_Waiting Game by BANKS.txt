I'm thinking it over
The way you make me feel all sexy, but it's causing me shame
I wanna lean on your shoulder
I wish I was allowed, but I don't wanna cause any pain
And if I'm feeling like I'm evil, we've got nothing to gain

[Chorus]
What if I never even see you 'cause we're both on a stage?
Don't tell me listen to your song because it isn't the same
I don't wanna say your love is a waiting game

[Verse 2]
Baby, I'm thinking it over
What if the way we started made it something cursed from the start?
What if it only gets colder?
Would you still wrap me up and tell me that you think this was smart?
'Cause, lately, I've been scared of even thinking 'bout where we are

[Chorus]
What if I never even see you 'cause we're both on a stage?
Don't tell me listen to your song because it isn't the same
I don't wanna say your love is a waiting game

[Chorus]
What if I never even see you 'cause we're both on a stage?
(What if I never even see you 'cause we're both on a stage?)
Don't tell me listen to your song because it isn't the same
(Don't tell me listen to your song because it isn't the same)
I don't wanna say your love is a waiting gameYou might also like
