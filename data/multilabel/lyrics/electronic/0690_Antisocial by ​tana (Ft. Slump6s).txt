[Chorus: BabySantana]
I-I-I-I-I'm with my twin, finna blow me a bag up in Neiman, then go cop a crib in Miami
I'm only fourteen but I'ma blow up and as soon as I do, I'ma get me a GRAMMY
She told me that I am the GOAT so I told her
"I know baby girl, like do you understand me?"
She followed my IG, I followed her back, then she came to my crib and she took off her panties
She asked me like, "Tana, are you antisocial?" And I told her, "No, girl I'm socially anti"
I put up my hands and I pulled out my blick then pulled out my katana, I feel like Tiandi
M-Me and Giuseppe, we hit Benihana's and spent us a bag, she like, "Boy, you so fancy"
I put on the drip then the fans do the same, now they hop on my wave like a bunch of chimpanzees

[Verse 1: BabySantana]
She said that she from New York so I'ma switch it up for a second and put on some drill
If he talking down on my brother, he gon' meet the Woo, we gon' pop that boy just like a pill
Now I feel like dang, I just poured me a deuce, now I'm off of the lean, I just cracked me a seal
I call up on G, he pull up to your block and my goons come and guarantee you get killed

[Verse 2: Slump6s]
They wanna get me, yeah I know
I stay with a stick like I'm G.I. Joe
I told her that I wanna hit it again (Ayy, CGM, fuck going on?)
She said, "Lil' 6 you too damn bold" (The fuck going on, Maajins?)
I did it once and made that girl forget it
I got the fire' to make a nigga quit it
Chop' to his face'll have a nigga shitting
Feel like Luisss the way I'm knocking off his fitted
Bitch I'm stayin' wit' it, I got extensions
Stay with a chop', did I forget to mention?
XD gon' put him in different directions
X-X-XD gon' put him in different dimensions
You is the student and I am the teacher
So I'm finna put his lil' ass in detention
Told her I'ma get her a bag and she texting me, "Period"
Fuck do it look like, a sentence?
I pop a Perc' and I still ain't die yet
My pockets fat, boy they need a diet
Getting some money, nigga you should try it
Got a suppressor, leaving him in silence
In the room, boy, I've been feeling like the highest
Th-Th-That nigga lost, I think he need some guidance
Step in the room and I'ma get behind it
No Fetty Wap but I'ma go rewind it
[Chorus: BabySantana]
I-I-I-I-I'm with my twin, finna blow me a bag up in Neiman, then go cop a crib in Miami
