The other one is, of course, outing yourself
I think be the first to out yourself, I always think
Because, you know, there's no end to the hypocrisy of the human heart

[Refrain]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

[Verse 1]
It's 5 a.m. and I'm on the radio
I'm supposed to call you
But I don't know what to say at all
And there's this girl, she wants me to take her home
She don't really love me though
I'm just on the radio

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind
You might also like[Chorus]
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

[Verse 2]
It's 6 a.m., I'm so far away from you
I don't wanna let you down
What am I supposed to do?
It's been three weeks at least, now, since I've been gone
And I don't even like the road
I'm just on the radio

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

[Chorus]
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest
[Refrain]
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah
Woah, woah, woah

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm not gonna tell you that I'm over it
'Cause I think about it every night I'm not sober, and
I know I keep these feelings to myself
Like I don't need nobody else
But you're not the only one on my mind

[Chorus]
If I'm being honest
If I'm being honest
You said I should be honest
So I'm being honest

[Outro]
If I'm being honest
