Let me escape in your arms
Baby I'm yours, baby I'm yours
Love don't come easy at all
I miss you so much, I miss you so much

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie Bergman]
Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart race, ooh, whoa

[Chorus: Natalie Bergman]
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we could be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the stars
Someday soon, we'll be together

[Verse 2: Natalie Bergman]
He was a dreamer at heart
Chasing the stars, chasing the stars
Wings spread to the sun
I miss you so much, I miss you so much

[Pre-Chorus: Natalie Bergman]
Tell me, is this freedom, baby?
Chasing after danger, making my heart break, ooh, whoa
You might also like[Chorus: Natalie Bergman]
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we could be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the stars
Someday soon, we'll be together

[Bridge: Wild Belle]
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together
We'll be together, we'll be together

[Chorus: Natalie Bergman]
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide
Maybe on the dark side we could be together, be together
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the stars
Someday soon, we'll be together, eh-eh, eh-eh-ey
Maybe if the stars align, maybe if our worlds collide (We'll be together, we'll be together)
Maybe on the dark side we could be together, be together (We'll be together, we'll be together)
Maybe in a million miles, on a highway through the stars (We'll be together, we'll be together)
Someday soon, we'll be together (We'll be together, we'll be together)
