I'm not a fan of puppeteers, but I've a nagging fear
Someone else is pulling at the strings
Something terrible is going down through the entire town
Wreaking anarchy and all it brings

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't sit idly, no, I can't move at all
I curse the name, the one behind it all

[Chorus]
Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
Discord, whatever did we do
To make you take our world away?
Discord, are we your prey alone
Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
Discord, we won't take it anymore
So take your tyranny away

[Post-Chorus]
Discord!
Discord!

[Verse 2]
I'm fine with changing status quo, but not in letting go
Now the world is being torn apart
A terrible catastrophe played by your symphony
What a terrifying work of art
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I can't sit idly, no, I can't move at all
I curse the name, the one behind it all

[Chorus]
Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
Discord, whatever did we do
To make you take our world away?
Discord, are we your prey alone
Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
Discord, we won't take it anymore
So take your tyranny away

[Post-Chorus]
Discord!
Discord!
Discord!
Discord!
Discord!
Discord!
Discord!
Discord!

[Outro]
Discord, I'm howlin' at the moon
And sleeping in the middle of a summer afternoon
Discord, whatever did we do
To make you take our world away?
Discord, are we your prey alone
Or are we just a stepping stone for taking back the throne?
Discord, we won't take it anymore
So take your tyranny away
