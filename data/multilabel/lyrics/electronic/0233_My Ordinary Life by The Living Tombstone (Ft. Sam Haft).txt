Jā, iku zo
Jan, ken, pon!

[Verse 1: Yoav Landau/"zero_one"]
They tell me keep it simple, I tell them take it slow
I feed and water an idea so I let it grow
I tell them take it easy, they laugh and tell me "no"
It's cool, but I don't see them laughin' at my money though
They spittin' facts at me, I’m spittin' tracks, catch me?
I'm spinning gold out my records, know you can’t combat me
They tell me Jesus walks, I tell them money talks
Bling got me chill, 'cause I'm living in an ice box
They tell me I've been sleepin', I say I'm wide awake
Tracks hot and ready, so they call me Mister Easy-Bake
They say the grass is greener, I think my grass is dank
Drivin' with a drank on an empty tank to the bank

[Pre-Chorus: Yoav Landau/"zero_one"]
Do you feel me? Take a look inside my brain
The people always different but it always feels the same
That's the real me, pop the champagne
The haters wanna hurt me, and I'm laughin' at the pain

[Chorus: Sam Haft/"Rust"]
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall, I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time

They tell me that I'm special, I smile and shake my head
I'll give them stories to tell friends about the things I said
They tell me I’m so humble, I say I'm turning red
They let me lie to them and don’t feel like they've been misled
They give so much to me, I'm losing touch, get me?
Served on a silver platter, ask for seconds, they just let me
They tell me I'm a god, I'm lost in the facade
Six feet off the ground at all times, I think I'm feelin' odd
No matter what I make, they never see mistakes
Makin' so much bread, I don't care that they're just being fake
They tell me they're below me, I act like I'm above
The people blend together, but I would be lost without their love

[Pre-Chorus: Yoav Landau/"zero_one"]
Can you heal me, have I gained too much?
When you become untouchable, you're unable to touch
Is there a real me? Pop the champagne
It hurts me just to think, and I don't do pain

[Chorus: Sam Haft/"Rust"]
Stayin' still, eyes closed
Let the world just pass me by
Pain pills, nice clothes
If I fall I think I'll fly
Touch me, Midas
Make me part of your design
None to guide us
I feel fear for the very last time
[Outro: Sam Haft/"Rust"]
Lay still, restless
Losing sleep while I lose my mind (Yeah)
All thrill, no stress
All my muses left behind (Left behind)
World is, below
So high up, I'm near divine (I'm so high up)
Lean in, let go
I feel fear for the very last time
