Trying to be funny and stuck in a room
There isn't much more to say about it
Can one be funny when stuck in a room?
Being in, trying to get something out of it

[Refrain]
Try making faces
Try telling jokes, making little sounds, ooh

[Verse 2]
I was a kid who was stuck in his room
There isn't much more to say about it
When you're a kid and you're stuck in your room
You'll do any old shit to get out of it

[Refrain]
Try making faces
Try telling jokes, making little sounds
[Chorus]
Well, well
Look who's inside again
Went out to look for a reason to hide again
Well, well
Buddy, you found it
Now, come out with your hands up
We've got you surrounded
