We got a ride, we got the night
I got the bottle, you got the light
We got the stars (Stars)
We got audio (Mmm)
We're gonna fly, we're getting high
You got the moon dust, I got the sky
We got the stars (Stars)
We got audio (Mmm)

[Chorus: Sia with Labrinth]
Make the bomb, bomb beat, I'll give you melody
Make the bomb, bomb beat, I'll give you melody
Make the song so sweet, you gon' come home with me, oh
Make the bomb, bomb beat, I'll give you melody
Make the bomb, bomb beat, I'll give you melody
Make the song so sweet, you gon' come home with me, oh

[Post-Chorus: Diplo]
(Ayy, ayy)
That audio
Play that audio
That, that

[Verse 2: Labrinth & Sia]
You got the heart, we got the soul
Just when the world sayin' they got no hold
Here comes the love
We got audio (A-audio)
We flyin' high, superhero
S on my chest, with my Marilyn Monroe
Feel like a star (Star)
'Cause we got audio
(Make it go)
