Ooh (I'm paralyzed)
Ooh
Ooh (Let's go)

[Verse 1]
I see you drowning in the purple lights
Diamonds shinin' bright
I see every ice on you
You snatch my soul, I'm crucified
I feel paralyzed
I'm so mesmerized by you (By you)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I know you're right for me
Ecstasy
I keep coming back for more
I think that you would die for me
Destiny
And this time, I know for sure

[Chorus]
Just don't break my heart (Don't break my heart)
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart (Don't break my heart)
I don't know if I can take it anymore
You might also like[Verse 2]
Take it anymore, take it anymore
I can't take another heartbreak or I'll end it all
And the girl I used to love
We broke up in the club
And I almost died in the discotheque

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I know she wasn't right for me
Enemy
I kept coming back for more
I'd rather you would die for me
Destiny
And this time, I know for sure

[Chorus]
Just don't break my heart (Don't break my heart)
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart (Don't break my heart)
I don't know if I can take it anymore
Don't break my heart (Don't you, don't you)
I'm falling apart already
Don't you break my heart (Don't you, don't you)
I don't know if I can take it anymore

[Bridge]
I believe the liquor's talking
I just need the room to stop and
I could be the one you want
Just as long as you don't break my heart
And I realized
When I kissed your neck
That the room is hot
I can taste your sweat
It's just you and I
In the discotheque
But don't you worry
[Chorus]
Just don't break my heart (Don't break my heart)
Don't let me down, please
Don't you break my heart (Don't break my heart)
I don't know if I can take it anymore
Don't break my heart (Don't you, don't you)
I'm falling apart already
Don't you break my heart (Don't you, don't you)
I don't know if I can take it anymore
