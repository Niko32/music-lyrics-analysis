I caught you watchin' me under the light
Can I realign?
They say it's easy to leave you behind
I don't wanna try

[Pre-Chorus]
Cut cover, take that test, hold courage to your chest
Don't wanna wait for you, don't wanna have to lose
All that I've compromised to feel another high
I've got to keep it down tonight

[Chorus]
And, oh, oh, oh
I was a king under your control
And, oh, oh, oh
I wanna feel like you've let me go, so let me go

[Verse 2]
Don't you remember how I used to like
Being on the line?
I dreamed you dreamed of me calling out my name
Is it worth the price?

[Pre-Chorus]
Cut cover, take that test, hold courage to your chest
Don't wanna wait for you, don't wanna have to lose
All that I've compromised to feel another high
I've got to keep it down tonight
You might also like[Chorus]
And, oh, oh, oh
I was a king under your control
And, oh, oh, oh
I wanna feel like you've let me go

[Bridge]
I had to break myself to carry on
No love and no admission take this from me tonight
Oh, oh, let's fight
Oh, let's fight
Oh, oh, let's fight
Oh

[Chorus]
And, oh, oh, oh
I was a king under your control
And, oh, oh, oh
I wanna feel like you've let me go, so let me go

[Outro]
Let go, let go, let go of everything
Let go, let go, let go of everything
Let go, let go, let go of everything
Let go, let go, let go of everything
