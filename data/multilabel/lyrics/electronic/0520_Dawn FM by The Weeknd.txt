This part I do alone
I'll take my lead, I'll take my lead on this road
And I need something (Something) to hold (To hold)
Make me believe in make-beliefs
'Cause after the light, is it dark? Is it dark all alone?
All alone

[Interlude: Jim Carrey]
You are now listening to 103.5 Dawn FM
You've been in the dark for way too long
It's time to walk into the light
And accept your fate with open arms
Scared? Don't worry
We'll be there to hold your hand and guide you through this painless transition
But what's the rush?
Just relax and enjoy another hour of commercial free yourself music on 103.5 Dawn FM
Stay tuned

[Outro: The Weeknd]
