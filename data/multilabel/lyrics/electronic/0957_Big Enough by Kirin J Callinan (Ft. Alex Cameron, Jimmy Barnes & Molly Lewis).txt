I've lived in lonely cities
I've crossed deserts on camel back
And I've filled the halls of folklore with things I'd rather we forget
I could sweep you off the street so saying this is goddamn tough
But this town might be big enough...

[Verse 2: Kirin J Callinan]
See, I reckon what you're saying
But this dog's run every course
I've roamed without my boots on
I've raced without my horse
And then I ate my horse's meat straight from my horse's bones
'Cause this dog
Must roam alone

[Verse 3: Alex Cameron, Kirin J Callinan, Both]
You could shoot me in the mountains
In the cold fat rain
We could do it in the countryside
As we walk the plain
It wouldn't give us any closure
All cowboys need to trust
That this town might be big enough
For both of us
You might also like[Chorus: Jimmy Barnes]
Aaah
Aaah
Aaah
Aaah
Aaaaaaaaaaah
Aaa
Aaah

[Verse 4: Kirin J Callinan with Alex Cameron]
Well, I'd be a doggamn liar
If I said this ain't a lonely town
And what I wouldn't give
To have a friend around
We could trade in all our silver bullets
And buy a patch of dust
This town might just be big enough
For all of us

[Chorus: Jimmy Barnes]
Aah
Aah

[Outro: Alex Cameron & Kirin J. Callinan, Jimmy Barnes]
