[Verse 1]
I have a heart, I swear I do
But just not, baby, when it comes to you
I get so hungry when you say you love me
(Hush) If you know what's good for you
I think you're hot, I think you're cool
You're the kinda guy I'd stalk in school
But now that I'm famous, you're up my anus
Now I'm gonna eat you fool

[Pre-Chorus]
I eat boys up, breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty, I drink their blood
Carnivore, animal, I am a cannibal
I eat boys up, you better run

[Chorus]
I am cannibal (Cannibal, cannibal, I am)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, I'll eat you up, I am)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, cannibal, I am)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, I'll eat you up)

Whenever you tell me I'm pretty
That's when the hunger really hits me
Your little heart goes pitter-patter
I want your liver on a platter
Use your finger to stir my tea
And for dessert, I'll suck your teeth
Be too sweet, and you'll be a goner (Yep)
I'll pull a Jeffrey Dahmer

[Pre-Chorus]
I eat boys up, breakfast and lunch
Then when I'm thirsty, I drink their blood
Carnivore, animal, I am a cannibal
I eat boys up, you better run

[Chorus]
I am cannibal (Cannibal, cannibal, I am)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, I'll eat you up, I am)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, cannibal, I am)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, I'll eat you up)

[Bridge]
Oh-woah-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-woah-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-woah-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-woah-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-woah-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-woah-oh-oh-oh, oh
Oh-woah-woah-oh-oh
Oh-woah-woah-oh-oh-oh, oh
[Chorus]
I am cannibal (Cannibal, cannibal, I am)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, I'll eat you up, I am)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, cannibal, I am)
I am cannibal (Cannibal, I'll eat you up)

[Outro]
I love you
I warned you
