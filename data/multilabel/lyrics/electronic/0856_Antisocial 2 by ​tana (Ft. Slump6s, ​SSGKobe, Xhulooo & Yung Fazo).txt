I'ma tell y'all what I said, bro, he's versatile
He's most likely to really blow up, very fast
And very soon because he's versatile
Um, he can do anything on any beat, bro
(Fuck goin' on, maajins?)
(Fuck you, mudd, haha)
Yeah, yeah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, woah, woah
Yeah, yeah, woah, woah

[Chorus: tana]
I-I-I-I-I'm wit' my twin, finna blow me a bag up in Louis then go cop a crib on the North side
1500, that's the gang, no, I cannot switch on my brothers, lil' bro, stay on your side
Shawty be speakin' a whole 'nother language, she say that Santana not human, of course not
We finna put that lil' boy in the grave, and if he makе a sound, then he gettin' his corpsе shot
Shawty said, "tana, you socially anti?" And I told her, "No, girl, I'm antisocial"
I-I-I-I-I don't like bein' 'round people sometimes, so the public keep sayin' I'm anti-local
Shawty told me that she keep gettin' wet, like, every time that she hear my vocals
Pull out my chopper, I'm shootin' at you and your gang 'til that chopper start jammin', it's over

[Verse 1: tana]
She say that she from Jamaica, so I switch it up for a second and put on the bongos
I feel like Dami 'cause I take your shawty and put in that work, I ain't talkin' trabajo
If he want smoke then we light up his Honda Civic like that boy had a ride through Chicago
He talkin' down so I call up my brothers to shoot that lil' boy with the whole semi-auto

I-I-I-I-I'm with my twin, finna blow me a bag up in Louis then go cop a crib on the North side
1500, that's the gang, no, I cannot switch on my brothers, lil' bro, stay on your side
Shawty be speakin' a whole 'nother language, she say that Santana not human, of course not
We finna put that lil' boy in the grave, and if he make a sound, then he gettin' his corpse shot
Shawty said, "tana, you socially anti?" And I told her, "No, girl, I'm antisocial"
I-I-I-I-I don't like bein' 'round people sometimes, so the public keep sayin' I'm anti-local
Shawty told me that she keep gettin' wet like every time that she hear my vocals
Pull out my chopper, I'm shootin' at you and your gang 'til that chopper start jammin', it's over

[Verse 2: Slump6s]
Don't make me bring out Dakota
You talkin' down, but you don't wanna go there
Pull up to your block and we don't see you nowhere (One and Only)
We make him lean like we pourin' a four here (Man, what the fuck goin' on, maajins?)
Chopper singin', Billie, no Eilish
Bullets so hot that they knock off his eyelash
You is an opp nigga, we do not like that
You textin' me, lil' ho, I do not write back
I'm really playin' that ho like a P4
My niggas shootin' your ass like a free throw
I'm at the crib, and I'm wearin' a mink coat
How many hoes? Nigga, I got like cinco
That ho be textin' my phone askin' me if I love her, and I had to tell her, "I think so"
Man, I got so many sons, so I feel like Mufasa, but no, I ain't talkin' 'bout Mingo
My niggas still finna play with the gadgets, if you talkin' down, then we slide with the ratchet
S-S-Santana stay wit' a lil' Uzi, and no, I ain't talkin' 'bout brand new Patek
Can't fuck wit' that lame-ass boy, he just be cappin', he just be ready to panic
I ain't never ran track, but 600 hopped on the track and he motherfuckin' ran it
I got a new ho out of the country, she just be talkin' to me in Spanish
They finna think that it's World War II by the way 1500 gon' slide with the cannon
I really don't be doin' shit to these niggas, but just let me talk, and I'll still do damage
My new shooter got a stutter, but he finna w-w-wet his ass up like a salmon
I'm countin' bands, nigga, you countin' pennies
I'm gettin' racks, nigga, I'm gettin' many
It's been a minute since me and gang linked up
Give 'em a call, and we eat out at Beni's
We finna eat out at lil' Benihana
Open the crib and say, "Hey", to his mama
Shout out lil' Autumn!, but all of my niggas they been gettin' money, hakuna matata (Haha, yeah)
[Verse 3: Yung Fazo]
Me and my gang, you know we on the come up
Call up lil' Dami, he gon' get you done up (One and Only)
Poppin' this molly 'til the fuckin' sun up (Man, what the fuck goin' on, maajins?)
You want a feature? It be like two-hundred
Told myself I was gon' blow, then I did it
Two bullets sit on your head like a fitted
Can't fuck with you, know that that shit is just business
Yeah, yeah-heh-heh, okay, yeah-heh
We gon' pull up in that Masi', yeah, hope I don't crash, yeah
Call up lil' tana, we slide with the chopper, we know that that shit finna blast, yeah
She didn't wan' fuck wit' me, now she wan' suck on me, 'cause she see me gettin' bands, yeah
Know that this shit finna get a lil' technical
Red dot, you know that we aim wit' the reticle
I got your bitch at my crib, she ridin' my dick, and I know that you is a lil' skeptical
Pour up the lean, and I drink a lil' chemical
She actin' lil' crazy, think she popped an edible
Watch the money pilin' up, it pilin' up, it pilin' up, and put a period, decimal
Me and Slump linked up in NYC
Shoot that lil' boy, he gon' D-I-E
Pick up the phone, and I call up Dakota
Put my hands on a her neck just like a choker
Your bitch, she ugly, she look like a joker
Tallied this money like we playin' poker
Bands so wet, man, I had to just soak up
My bitch a Nina, she love when I tote her
[Verse 4: Xhulooo]
Yeah, yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah (One and Only), yeah, oh yeah, yeah (Man, what the fuck goin' on, maajins?, oh-oh)
Yeah, yeah (Oh-oh), yeah, oh yeah (Oh-oh)
Yeah, oh yeah (Oh-oh), yeah, oh yeah (Oh-oh, oh)
That .40 pop him in his noggin, now he wanna play, we crack him like an egg
Run in his house wit' that G19 on my hip, w-we finna leave him for dead
The choppa gon' flip him like Gabby or maybe a Patek, but you know we aim for the head
We ride wit' the smoke, this AR gon' pop him, if he talkin' crazy, we fill him wit' lead
He said that he want the smoke, so you know that I gave him the smoke like a lighter, yeah
.40 gon' punch you like Tyson, but I will not touch you, I am not a fighter, yeah
Keep it a hundred, you don't gotta cap wit' me, baby, you know you a liar, yeah
I'm in the front of the 'Vette wit' lil' Fazo and you know we burnin' them tires, yeah
1500, that's forever, if you talkin' crazy, know I'm uppin' fire' (One and Only)
I'm in the new Hellcat with the gango, whole gang drippin', I don't know who flyer (Man, what the fuck goin' on, maajins?)
Gas got me on slo-mo, and I know that I'm a lil' tired (Whoa)
That boy said he was cool, but we know he a rat 'cause he wearin' a wire, yeah

[Interlude: tana]
When you needed me the most, I was there, untitled
But when I needed you, you were nowhere to be found, untitled
I had so much love that was just there building up for you, and you left me in the dust, untitled
You made me look like a fool, all the embarrassing videos and pictures of us together
I thought it would never end, but look at us now
No longer in contact, untitled
I love you, I'll see you soon
And with that being said, untitled

[Verse 5: SSGKobe]
Hit from the back like (Yeah)
H-H-Hittin' your bitch, make her cum right (Here)
He talkin' shit, see the sunlight (Hey)
He tried to run up, he see this (Yeah)
I-I-I got too many hoes up on my line for me, take off a bitch if that bitch ain't the (Kind)
I could've really gave this ho the whole world, but she fucked it up with that bitch and that— (Lyin')
Hop in the Trackhawk, this bitch is a push-start
I-I-I'm sippin' lean wit' your bitch, sippin' Wockhardt
Hard for the 'gram, but you pussy, you not hard
Fuckin' your thot, smokin' dope, I'm a rockstar
Roll up a 'Wood, made me roll a lumber
And that bitch kinda fine, I'ma get her number
I'ma cheat on this ho 'cause I don't care
I'm like six bodies up, I can't use no rubber

[Chorus: tana]
I-I-I-I-I'm wit' my twin, finna blow me a bag up in Louis then go cop a crib on the North side (One and Only)
1500, that's the gang, no, I cannot switch on my brothers, lil' bro, stay on your side (Man, what the fuck goin' on, maajins?)
Shawty be speakin' a whole 'nother language, she say that Santana not human, of course not

I-I-I-I-I don't like bein' 'round people sometimes, so the public keep sayin' I'm anti-local
Shawty told me that she keep gettin' wet like every time that she hear my vocals
Pull out my chopper, I'm shootin' at you and your gang 'til that chopper start jammin', it's over

[Outro: PVO E]
And how old is he doing this, bro?
How old is he doing this, bro?
He's doing this at the age of four—
Nah, I don't think y'all hear me, bro
At the age of fourteen
He's better than a lot of underground rappers right now
At fourteen, at fourteen
Actually, I'ma keep it a buck, some mainstream rappers
Like, I'm tryna, like, I'm telling y'all right now, y'all better hop on the wave, bro
Soon, it might be too late
