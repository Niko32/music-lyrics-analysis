Just like in the movies
It starts to rain and we
We're the broken beauties
Blindfolded minds collide and we fall

[Pre-Chorus]
When the curtain drops
Our touch is just a touch
Not like in the movies
Our story's after the end

[Chorus]
Like strangers, perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I
Strangers, perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I

[Verse 2]
Memories in photos
Too easy to rewrite
Left as lonely shadows
Holding each other tight and we fall
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
When the curtain drops
Our touch is just a touch
Not like in the movies
Our story's after the end

[Chorus]
Like strangers, perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I

[Post-Chorus]
Think we got it, but we made up a dream
'Cause we got a pretty look at what we could be, woo
I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone
Think we got it, but we made up a dream
'Cause we got a pretty look at what we could be, woo
I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone

[Bridge]
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
Not like in the movies
You and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I, you and I
Not like in the movies
[Chorus]
Like strangers, perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I
Strangers, perfect pretenders
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
It could never be us, eh
Just you and I

[Post-Chorus]
Think we got it, but we made up a dream
'Cause we got a pretty look at what we could be, woo
I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone
Think we got it, but we made up a dream
'Cause we got a pretty look at what we could be, woo
I don't want you, all you want is someone
Going home together to forget we're alone

[Outro]
Strangers
(Think we got it, but we made up a dream)
('Cause we got a pretty look at what we could be, woo)
Perfect pretenders
(I don't want you, all you want is someone)
(Going home together to forget we're alone)
We're falling head over heels
For something that ain't real
(Think we got it, but we made up a dream)
('Cause we got a pretty look at what we could be, woo)
It could never be us, eh
(I don't want you, all you want is someone)
Just you and I
