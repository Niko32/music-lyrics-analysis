I was born in a city
Where the winter nights don't ever sleep
So this life's always with me
The ice inside my veins will never bleed

[Refrain]
My, ooh
My, ooh

[Verse 2]
Uh, every time you try to fix me
I know you'll never find that missing piece
When you cry and say you miss me
I lie and tell you that I'll never leave, but

[Pre-Chorus]
I sacrificed (Sacrificed)
Your love for more of the night (Of the night)
I try to put up a fight (Up a fight)
Can't tie me down (Down)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna sacrifice
For your love, I try
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my timе
You might also like[Refrain]
My, ooh
My, ooh

[Verse 3]
I hold you through the toughest parts
When you feel likе it's the end
'Cause life is still worth living
Yeah, this life is still worth living
I can break you down and pick you up
And fuck like we are friends
But don't be catchin' feelings
Don't be out here catchin' feelings 'cause

[Pre-Chorus]
I sacrificed (Sacrificed)
Your love for more of the night (Of the night)
I try to put up a fight (Up a fight)
Can't tie me down (Down, down, down)

[Chorus]
I don't wanna sacrifice
For your love, I try
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my time
I don't wanna sacrifice
For your love (Oh), I try
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my time (My, ooh)
[Bridge]
Oh, baby
I hope you know that I, I tried
Oh, baby (Baby)
I hope you know I love my time, oh

[Outro]
I don't wanna sacrifice
I don't wanna, I try (Hey)
I don't wanna sacrifice
But I love my time
My, ooh
My, ooh
