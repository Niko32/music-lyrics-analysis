Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, oh-oh, yeah

[Verse 1: Charlie Puth]
What you thinkin'?
You think that you could be better off with somebody new
(No, oh, oh, baby, no)
You say you're leavin'
Well, if you wanna leave, there ain't nobody stoppin' you
(No, oh, oh, baby, no)

[Pre-Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I won't beg for your love
Won't say, "Please"
I won't fall to the ground on my knees
You know I've given this everything
Baby, honestly
Baby, honestly

[Chorus: Charlie Puth]
I lie for you, baby
Die for you, baby
Cry for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby
And only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
