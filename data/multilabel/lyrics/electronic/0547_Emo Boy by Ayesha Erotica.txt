[Verse 1]
Saw this boy at the mall last week
Got the kind of look to make me freak
That long ass hair with the tightest jeans
My Chemical Romance on his tee
He looks so sick like he was dyin'
If I said he wasn’t hot then I'd be lyin'
Please, handsome, don’t be coy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy

Hey, hey, hey emo boy
Hey emo boy
Hey, hey, hey emo boy
Hey emo boy
Hey, hey, hey emo boy

[Verse 2]
He said I look like Hanna Beth
And bitch, I almost lost my breath
"Wanna fuck in the back of the Hot-Topic?"
Lift me up and then I drop it
He bought me tickets to Warped Tour
Should I go? Well, bitch, for sure
He might not look like he gets bitches
But honey, that dick was eleven inches

[Pre-Chorus]
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
Come on, fuck me, emo boy
[Chorus]
Hey emo boy
Hey, hey, hey emo boy

Hey, hey, hey emo boy
Hey emo boy
Hey, hey, hey emo boy
Hey emo boy
Hey, hey, hey emo boy
