Can you see it? The worst is over
The monsters in my head are scared of love
Fallen people, listen up
It's never too late to change your luck

[Pre-Chorus]
So don't let them steal your light (Eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh)
Don't let them break your stride (Eh, eh-eh, eh-eh, eh-eh)
There is light on the other side
And you'll see all the raindrops falling behind
It's a revolution, make it out tonight
It's a revolution

[Chorus]
It's a reva, rev
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
It's a reva, rev
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse]
