Do-re-mi-fa-sol-la-ti-do
Rise to the highest, baby, look at my scale (Ha)
Mmm, nothing is challenging
When I take a shot, yeah, I ain't gonna fail (Ha)
Mmm, I’ma eat the whole box
Every topping that you can imagine
(Daeng, daeng, daeng, pizza) Mmm?
Franchise overpowered
Got their eyes on me
Hate or love, see they gon' imitate
Can't stop following
Prolly cause we always dominate
Yeah, I know, yeah, I know
Yeah, they want a piece of mine
Better not hesitate
When it all comes crashing on your face

[Pre-Chorus: Bang Chan, Seungmin, I.N, Lee Know]
Setting up my ambitions
Check ’em one at a time, yeah, I made it
Now it's time for ignition
I'm the start, heat it up
They follow, burning up a chain reaction, oh, oh, oh
Go fire it up, oh, oh, no
Assemble the crowd now, now
Line 'em up on the ground
No leaving anyone behind

I'ma knock it down like domino
Domino, domino, domino, domino, domino, domino
I'ma knock it down like domino
Domino, domino, domino, domino, domino, domino
Dan-dan-dan-dan

[Post-Chorus: Seungmin, Lee Know, Felix]
Play (Play)
With a little motion, get everyone's attention
Pay attention
I don't play (Play)
I ain’t messin’ 'round when I start a new sensation, yeah
Like domino

[Verse 2: Han, Felix, Changbin, Hyunjin]
Ayy, domino, flick and a drop and I see it all fall down
Shakin’ the world, magnitude makin' everything crumble like blah, blah
Okay, all that's left is dust, A.K.A. "The Bulldozer"
Right when everyone falls, they're crawling ’cause they can't help but follow
Spitting out a single joke makes everybody L-O-L
Think you can outdo me? Let me kick you out to somewhere else (Bye-bye)
I always try to do it one by one
But I know with just a single nod, I'm knocking over millions

[Pre-Chorus: Seungmin, I.N, Lee Know, Bang Chan]
Setting up my ambitions
Check 'em one at a time, yeah, I made it
Now it's time for ignition
I'm the start, heat it up
They follow, burning up a chain reaction, oh, oh, oh
Go fire it up, oh, oh, no
Assemble the crowd now, now
Line 'em up on the ground
No leaving anyone behind
[Chorus: Han, All, Bang Chan, Felix]
I'ma knock it down like domino
Domino, domino, domino, domino, domino, domino
I'ma knock it down like domino
Domino, domino, domino, domino, domino, domino
Dan-dan-dan-dan

[Post-Chorus: Han, Lee Know, Felix]
Play (Play)
With a little motion, get everyone's attention
Pay attention
I don't play (Play)
I ain't messin' 'round when I start a new sensation, yeah
Like domino

[Bridge: Hyunjin, Han, Felix]
Just a little nudge, they think they won't budge
In the end, they all come falling down, they're not like us
The jealousy inside, there's envy in their eyes
Tryna hide their feelings but they can't put up a fight
Hey, there ain't no stoppin' the domino
Hey, there ain't no stoppin' the domino
One by one, go down, down, down, down
One by one, they follow

[Chorus: Changbin, All, Hyunjin, Felix]
I'ma knock it down like domino
Domino, domino, domino, domino, domino, domino
I'ma knock it down like domino
Domino, domino, domino, domino, domino, domino
Like domino
