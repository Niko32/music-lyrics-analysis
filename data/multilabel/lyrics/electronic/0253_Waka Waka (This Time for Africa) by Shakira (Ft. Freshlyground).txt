[Verse 1: Shakira]
You're a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up and dust yourself off
Get back in the saddle
You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious, we're getting closer
This isn't over

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
The pressure's on, you feel it
But you got it all, believe it
When you fall get up, oh, oh
If you fall get up, eh, eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
'Cause this is Africa

[Chorus: Shakira]
Tsamina mina, eh, eh
Waka waka, eh, eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

Y vamos por todo
People are raising
Their expectations
Go on and feed them, this is your moment
No hesitations

[Pre-Chorus: Shakira]
Today's your day, I feel it
You paved the way, believe it
If you get down, get up, oh, oh
When you get down, get up, eh, eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa
