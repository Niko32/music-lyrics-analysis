[Verse 1]
Bitch wan' roast me 'cause I got a Xbox One (Nigga)
I don't even have no games, all I play is GTA
My nigga got Franklin dick (Move)
Livin' in a Franklin crib, I'ma get frank, lil' bitch
Why you on my frank like this? (Sorry)
Bitch, I'm annual flossing, VVS
Yeah, I play Animal Crossing, GameCube, 3DS
I ain't ever been poor, used to play Sims 4
Put a lil' wall 'round niggas, take the door off
Trap 'em in the swimmin' pool (Dag dag)
I don't play Fortnite, fuck that
Chun-Li when I street fight, bust back
You ain't got combos, what's that?
Rock bitches on Mortal Kombat (Finish her)
It's tricky to rock a rhyme (It's tricky), murk bitches on SSX
Leave bitches all bald like Seeiah
Mic check 'em like, "Test, test, test"
I remember my downward spiral
Back when I was playin' Spyro
When I never went out and lied low
Way before my lil' ass went viral
Super Smash Bros., you so ass though
Prolly pick Kirby so you don't get smashed on (Hi)
You might also like[Interlude]
Shake that ass, ho (Shake it, just shake)
Shake that ass, ho (Shake it, just shake)
Shake that ass, ho (Shake that ass)
Shake that ass, yeah
Can I get a "hell yeah"?

[Chorus]
Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Fight)
Can I get a "hell yeah, yeah"? (Nigga)
Can I get a "hell yeah"?
Can I get a "hell yeah"? Can I get a "hell yeah"?
(Can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I, can I)
Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Fight)
Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Nigga)
Can I get a "hell yeah"?
Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Yeah, yeah)
Hell yeah
Can I get a "yeah, yeah"? (Can I, got, got, got?)
Can I, got, got, got, uh, can I get a "yeah, yeah"? (Can I?)
Can I get a "yeah"? Get a "yeah, yeah"?
Can I get a "hell yeah"? Yeah
Can I get a "yeah"? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Can I get a "haha"? (Get, got, yeah)
Can I, yeah, yeah, yeah?
Hell yeah
[Verse 2]
Master of my craft, never played Minecraft
Look how my mind craft things
Be on my Halo tings
Look at my Sonic rings
Awooga, don't push me
I "Hadouken", hear the “Toasty”?
Donkey Kong when he drum on that pussy
I'on play but I sure ain't no rookie
Steal a nigga like a bandit, boo
Then spend every penny of his bands and loot
Now she think that I'm the devil like a bandicoot
Wawawawawawa— what you wanna do?
Yeah, can I get it, get it, yeah?

[Chorus]
Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah)
Can I get a "hell yeah, yeah, yeah"? (Hell yeah)
Can I get a "hell yeah, yeah, yeah"? (Hell yeah)
Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Hell yeah)
Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Yeah, yeah)
Can I get a "hell yeah, yeah, yeah"? (Yeah, yeah)
Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Ha, oh, yeah)
Can I get a "hell yeah"? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Uh, uh-uh
