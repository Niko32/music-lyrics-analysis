So I got edges that scratch
And sometimes I don't got a filter
But I'm so tired of eatin'
All of my misspoken words

[Pre-Chorus]
I know my disposition gets confusing
My disproportionate reactions fuse with my eager state
That's why you wanna come out and play with me, yeah
Why?
Why?
Why?

[Chorus]
Stooped down and out, you got me beggin' for thread
To sew this hole up that you ripped in my head
Stupidly think you had it under control
Strapped down to somethin' that you don't understand
Don't know what you were gettin' yourself into
You should have known, secretly, I think you knew

[Verse 2]
I got some dirt on my shoes
My words can come out as a pistol
And I'm no good at aimin'
But I can aim it at you
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I know my actions, they may get confusin'
But my unstable ways is my solution to even space
That's why you want to come out and play with me, yeah

[Chorus]
Stooped down and out, you got me beggin' for thread
To sew this hole up that you ripped in my head
Stupidly think you had it under control
Strapped down to somethin' that you don't understand
Don't know what you were gettin' yourself into
You should have known, secretly, I think you knew
(Secretly, I think you knew)

[Bridge]
Hold it out (Woah)
Try to hide it out, but my tracks are better
Hold it out (Woah)
Try to hide it out, but my tracks are better
Hold it out (Woah)
Try to hide it out, but my tracks are better
Hold it out (Woah)
Try to hide it out, but my tracks are better

[Chorus]
Stooped down and out, you got me beggin' for thread
To sew this hole up that you ripped in my head
Stupidly think you had it under control
Strapped down to something that you don't understand
Don't know what you were getting yourself into
You should have known, secretly, I think you knew
[Outro]
Secretly, I think you knew
