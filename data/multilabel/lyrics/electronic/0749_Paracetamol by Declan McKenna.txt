There's a boy, fifteen, with a gun in his hand
And the people with no audience say he should be hanged
And they ask him for his motive, but they don't understand
Why they love like they do, like they do
There's a girl, fifteen, with her head in a noose
Because she's damned to live, well, she's damned to choose
And the animals walked in twos by twos
Showing love like they do, like they do
There's a girl, fifteen, although she isn't sure
Well, how the hell could you want anything more?
You beautiful, perfect, immaculate whore
I'm in love, love with you, love with you
Ooh ooh

[Chorus]
Oh, won't you let me finish?
You drive me insane
The world will keep on turning
Even if we're not the same
Don't come on to me, come on to me

[Verse 2]
There's a boy, fifteen, turning into a man
Well, tell me one other thing that he can
While you forced a smile through a jealous hand
Showing love like you do, like you do
There's a boy, fifteen, and he's attempted to sue
'Cause he's definitely sure that it's true
Well, what kind of man, kind of man are you?
Showing love like you do, like you do
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, won't you let me finish?
You drive me insane
The world will keep on turning
Even if we're not the same
Don't come on to me, come on to me

[Bridge]
So, tell me what's on your mind, so tell me what's on your mind
And don't forget your paracetamol smile
So, tell me what's on your mind, so tell me what's on your mind
And don't forget your paracetamol smile
So, tell me what's on your mind, so tell me what's on your mind
And don't forget your paracetamol smile
So, tell me what's on your mind, so tell me what's on your mind
You're emotionally challenged
Why do you waste your talent?
The world around you's manic
Do you have no shame?
Come on to me, come on to me

[Outro]
Ooh-ooh, ha-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ha-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ha-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ha-ooh
