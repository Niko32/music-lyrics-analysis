Oh!
Oh, I think I win a lotto
Can you believe me, brother?
Like for real
Oh, I think I win a lotto
Can you believe me, brother?
Like for real, man, ну блядь

[Verse 1]
Why have abs when you can have kebabs?
No Houston trap, but only hot Russian raps
One stripe in the night make me feel alright
Three stripes on my body make my swag real tight
And people ask, why I do so much narcotics
'Cause it puts my mind straight in a tropics
While I'm in the ghetto, eating soup with my chopsticks
Motherfucker, what?

[Chorus]
Oh, I think I win a lotto
Oh my God, can you believe me, brother?
All I do is success, smooth as butter
Attractive to the bees, they wanna smell my flower — oh my God, eh
Fuckin' with no rubber with my lady, no problem
Cleaner than the rubber
She, she no skinny model
She a shuttle
Oh, I think I win a lotto
Can you believe me, brother?
Tonight I take double, cork from the bottle
All I do is sin but God gave me a halo, huh
Fuck you doin', think we playin'
Everything I do is amazin', amazin', amazin', huh
You might also like[Bridge]
Dirty motherfucker, but I look so clean
Hustler spirit all's paid by my dreams
Take a kaleidoscope, I want you to see what I see
Call me lumberjack, 'cause I smoke trees
They say I'm really good in the things I do
I don't make myself, I don't think like you, I don't dress like you
I smell like me, no piss perfume, no boys like me
No boys like me

[Chorus]
Oh, I think I win a lotto
Can you believe me, brother?
My brother, my brother, my brother, my brother
Oh, I think I win a lotto
Can you believe me, brother?
My brother, my brother, my brother, my brother
