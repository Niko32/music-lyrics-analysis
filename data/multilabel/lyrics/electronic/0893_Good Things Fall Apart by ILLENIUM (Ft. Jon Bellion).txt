Did I say something wrong?
Did you hear what I was thinking?
Did I talk way too long
When I told you all my feelings that night?
Is it you? Is it me?
Did you find somebody better?
Someone who isn't me
'Cause I know that I was never your type
Never really your type

[Pre-Chorus]
Overthinking's got me drinking
Messing with my head, woah

[Chorus]
Tell me what you hate about me
Whatever it is, I'm sorry
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know I can be dramatic
But everybody said we had it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart
You might also like[Verse 2]
When you said it was real
Guess I really did believe you
Did you fake how you feel
When we parked down by the river that night?
That night, that night
When we fogged up the windows in your best friend's car
'Cause we couldn't leave the windows down in December
Woah

[Chorus]
Tell me what you hate about me
Whatever it is, I'm sorry
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know I can be dramatic
But everybody said we had it
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Overthinking's got me drinking
Messing with my head, oh
[Chorus]
Tell me what you hate about me (Tell me)
Whatever it is, I'm sorry (Oh, I'm sorry)
Yeah, yeah, yeah (Oh, I'm sorry)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I know I can be dramatic (I know I can be)
But everybody said we had it (Woo)
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm coming to terms with a broken heart
I guess that sometimes good things fall apart
