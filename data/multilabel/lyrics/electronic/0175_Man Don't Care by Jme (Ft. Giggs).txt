[Verse 1: Jme]
I've got a black ski mask, but I don't ski
But I snowboard, dash an MC off-piste
If one of you try violate me
You'll get a punch in the face with my front door key
Punch in the neck with my back door key
Box in the mout with my X6 key
Box in the eye with the fob
I use to log into my HSBC
Talk about banks, kill 'em with Ps
Run up in your girl's house with two of my Gs
Get the money out, put the money in his mout
Then suffocate man with about two Gs
Suffocate man with about four Gs
Suffocate man, then I might just breeze
I'll bury man two foot shallow
Ain't got time to dig six feet deep
These MCs and rappers wanna chat 'bout their syllables
And their multis and their similes
And all that shit, then I come through with my ABC
Girls and man are like "Jme's deep"
Bare pictures when they see me on street
Old school rudeboy like Crazy T
All you man don't want it with me
I'm a bad rudeboy, badboy MC
Say my name, Jme
Nostradamus couldn't see me
Expelliarmus couldn't stop me
How could a man with a uni degree
Be bussing up mic and chatting this greaze?
'Cause the music originated
And will always remain in the streets

Man don't care about all that (Yeah, flexin')

'Cause man don't care about all that (Flexin')

[Verse 2: Giggs]
Cuz, I'm the most immediate, he's just an old school eediat
Ain't doing local things but we be them local geezers
Just look at my list of friends as he holds 'em up with tweezers
Yeah, man used to move that white, yeah, we be them old school dealers
She's lighting up some sensis, he's lighting up amnesias
I'm 'bout to get it started, I'm 'bout to get amnesia'd
Man might have to move up Thelma, might have to touch Louise's
'Cause at the top it's just us, yeah, man had to quote Lil Reese's
I'm like Batman, da-na-da-na-da-na
Hardest, just let me confirm it
Loafers just have to be Herm√®s
Burners, went bap and hit Bernard
Hot furnace, I'm back with big burners
That's my spot, I'm back with that permit
Pull that pistol back and then burn it
Friday shit, I bap and big worm it
Excuse me? What? Pardon?
I had to just ask 'em
Iron Man, the MAC'll just Stark 'em
Man's like Buu, I'm back with that Majin
Like Adam and Eve, I'm back in that garden
Wha di bloodclart, I'm back, the don gorgon
Started off light, I think, and then darkened
Hollowman, Jme, I'm done talking
Kill 'em with D, kill an MC
Digestives, cinnamon tea
Ain't no filling them shoes, 'cause they still on his feet
Man's down south hustling with no gold grill in his teeth
