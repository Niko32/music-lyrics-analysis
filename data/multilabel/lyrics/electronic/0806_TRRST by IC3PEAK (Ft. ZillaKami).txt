[Припев: Nastya]
Mama, they say I'm a terrorist, what?
I did nothing wrong, but I got on a blacklist
Mama, they say I'm a terrorist, why?
If doomsday is coming — я не попаду в рай
Mama, they say I'm a terrorist, what?
I did nothing wrong, but I got on a blacklist
Mama, they say I'm a terrorist, why?
If doomsday is coming — я не попаду в рай

[Куплет 1: Nastya]
Вроде бы плохо, а вроде нормально
Больше нет слёз, даже если больно
Будь собой, никого не слушай
Им нужны деньги, мне нужны души
I feel so low, but it seems normal
No more tears, even if you hurt me
Будь собой, никого не слушай
Им нужны деньги, мне нужны души

[Бридж: Nastya]
Is it so wrong if I want to die, want to die?
Is it so wrong if I want to cry, want to cry?
Is it so wrong if I want to die, want to die?
Is it so wrong if I want to cry, want to cry?

[Куплет 2: ZillaKami]
Mama, they say I'm a terrorist
'Cause my condition so derelict
And no glue needed, I'm the severance
A new war started, hang the activists
It's all war for a man with a vendetta
When he laces up black leather boots (Okay)
Don't peak ya head after when you said, what you said
They got snipers up on the roof (Okay)
Just pack canned food and stay in for a day (What?)
Get an AK 'cause it never ever breaks (What?)
Kiss your mom bye and then run, run away (What?)
Run, run away, just run, run away (What?)
Hang me from the gallows in front of em' all
Watch my neck breaking when I make the fall
Hang me from the gallows in front of em' all
Look at me dead and say, "Problem is solved" (Yeah, hey)
[Аутро: Nastya]
Is it so wrong if I want to die, want to die?
Is it so wrong if I want to cry, want to cry?
Is it so wrong if I want to die, want to die?
Is it so wrong if I want to cry, want to cry?
