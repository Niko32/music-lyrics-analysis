Really can't remember where I left my spine
Carryin' my body in a bag for dimes
Hidden in the pages of the New York Times at home
And maybe I'll be better if I take my meds
Ain't a doubleheader if you lose your head
Try the medication that I bought instead
It's workin' for a little, but there's not much left

[Chorus]
Darling, don't you weep
There's a place for me
Somewhere we can sleep
See you in your dreams

[Verse 2]
Ever since a little girl, I found it sweet
Drivin' past a graveyard on a lonesome street
All the little flowers gave me somethin' to believe in
Never knew the feelin' of a stable home
Been a couple years of livin' on the road
Couldn't really tell you where they'd leave a stone
To visit me when I am dead and gone

[Chorus]
Darlin', don't you weep
There's a place for me
Somewhere we can sleep
I'll see you in your dreams
Darlin', don't you cry
Head fast toward the light
Foolish men have tried
But only you have shown me how to love bein' alive
You might also like[Bridge]
Until it's time to see the light
I'll make my own with you each night
I'll kidnap all the stars and I will keep them in your eyes
I'll wrap them up in velvet twine
And hang 'em from a fishin' line
So I can see them anytime I like

[Chorus]
Darlin', don't you weep
There's a place for me
Somewhere we can sleep
I'll see you in your dreams
Darlin', don't you cry
Head fast toward the light
Foolish men have tried
But only you have shown me how to love bein' alive
