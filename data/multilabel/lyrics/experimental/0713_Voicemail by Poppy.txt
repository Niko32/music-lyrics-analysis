I can't feel my fingers
I can’t feel my toes
There's blood on my necklace
And blood on my clothes
I called up the police
Their voicemail was full
I guess I'm just out here
I’m on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I'm on my, I'm on my, I'm on my own
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I’m on my, I’m on my, I'm on my own

[Chorus]
Runnin’, I'm runnin', I'm runnin’
Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'

[Verse 2]
Do I make you angry?
Should I leave you alone?
You keep running from me
It's all that you know

I guess I'm just out here
I'm on my own

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I'm on my, I'm on my, I'm on my own
I'm on my own, I'm on my own
I'm on my, I'm on my, I'm on my own

[Chorus]
Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
