Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I saw your eyes
Your eyes fall
You didn't wanna cry
So you kept your eyes closed
I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape

I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape, yeah

I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape

I saw your eyes
I saw your eyes fall
You didn't wanna cry
So you kept your eyes closed
I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape
You might also likeI could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape

Coming down Fig
Turn left on Gage
I had an M5
Headlights were square like the Jakes
Race on a date
Race and sedate
I know you lie
You just don't lie to my face
I can't be great ‘til…
I can escape

Coming down Fig
Turn left on Gage
Had an M5
When headlights were square like the Jakes
Race on a date
Race and sedate
I know you lie
You just don't lie to my face
I can be great
What's that?
149
Oh, it's fast
Yeah
Cool
Yeah

[Part II]

[Verse 1]
I saw your eyes
I saw your eyes fall
You didn't wanna cry
So you kept your eyes closed
I could be great
I'm on my way
If I want escape
I can escape
We was on a date
I took you to McKenzie's
That's like your favorite
I don't like fried chicken
I don't want no Chick-fil-A
And I know they rob niggas
Can't do that drive-thru today
Coming down Fig
Turn left on Gage
I had the M5 when the
Headlights were square like the Jakes
Race on a date
Race and sedate
I know you lie to me
You just don't lie to my face
I can't be great ‘til I'm grateful for it
You just want hate, you got a gift for it
You don't wanna fight, you ain't built for that, huh
Yeah, roll call, you can see my hands
Jaws gon' break
Lip gon' bust, you like
“Why you snuck up on me
And ain't say nothing?”
I bit until my tongue gushed
I couldn't say 'I I—'
Huh? I ain't say nothing
I ain't say nothing
Get so paranoid
I ain't see nothing…
[Verse 2]
I used to play tough with the cops, had ideas
Told my girl who protest hold me a spot, and I'll go
Black folk know what talking white means, but still
Hold two open hands up in the sky, finger quotes
In my gangly youth my limbs used to swing like Polo tees
Mazal tov, still pop a bottle like what Puff did Steve
If you can't tote your own weight then what's this buff shit even ‘bout?
Crystals in your lil' feet, that's all that dust protein
Swoop Tremaine from Calabasas in a Brit sports car
We used to cypher in Marc Jacobs, had the library card
At Scott's comparing the silver spoons to plastic knives and sporks
I was the dog breathless chasing the car up the street
If I ever catch it I'll panic, that's the flaw in me
Nothing glamorous about growing up poor and naïve
Standing on the balls of my feet, trying to pray before I sleep

[Chorus]
Selling like red light pussy
Gotta waterfall douche it
Level head on the cushion
Light pink I'm revving
Light green, I'm someone like you, someone like me
Ring finger might sure get tooken
Wrist like springs, natural springs, water green indoor cookie
Other than me and you, ain't nobody else coming between, the glue stuck
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got the look, get looks
They never seen stars, the city too bright
Bright, bright, bright, bright

[Verse 3]
I try to sleep, can't get a lot
Make dreams bleed into days
The pressure couldn't stop
The bleeding I started seeing things
Watching out for demons
Blocked him like a screen, these plays
I was always reading, yeah
Then some hair grew where the sun don't shine
And I started feeling like pussy popping was the paradigm
Getting my dick wet, maritime
Lying on my virgin, Jergens moisturized
Gee whiz, gee whiz, gee whiz
All my friends is so, “No homo”
Blaze to trail behind
No heroes in front of mind
Just rappers who'd evolve with time
Looked up to them, knew all the rhymes
But at that time they enforced a bias
You know like some cops stop and frisk a guy
‘Cause he's brown, so of course he sides
With all the gangs these lames is extorted by
Switch lanes in the Porsche I drive
Let the police Ford Explorer by
Sirens screaming like they four or five
Throwing tantrums on the 405
Still on the whey like I'm tryna gain
Don't hibernate in the winter, that's where summer bodies are made
Just leg days like a sprinter
With the Bryan Baby blue interior
Big B's like GMO's
And they sting when my eyes close
All I see when my eyes close
Blame my emo on time zones
It's the same but different
Sets, twin siblings, head spinning
Exorcist

[Chorus]
Selling like red light pussy
Gotta waterfall douche it
Level head on the cushion
Light pink I'm revving
Light green, I'm someone like you, someone like me
Ring finger might sure get tooken
Wrist like springs, natural springs, water green indoor cookie
Other than me and you, ain't nobody else coming between, the glue stuck
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got the look, get looks
They never seen stars, the city too bright
Bright bright bright bright

[Bridge]
Praying Mantis
Fit by the Asians, wrist by Lorraine
Big Pharrell praying hands
Big P, big P
Buss down face, two levitating hands
I wanna see the money in cash
So that I can truly grasp
Thanking the savior, God did a favor
Big Pharrell praying hands
Big P, big P, big P, big P
Yeah, uh, Big P
Speaking of God, at ten years old, I switched church homes
Speaking of, speaking of God, speaking of God
Yeah, yeah
No one to talk me off the ledge
Had to get in my own head
Had to get in my own head

[Break]
You can go to the, uh
That
Whenever you feel like it…
The first one, the uh
Maybe keep it in four though
Uh huh

[Verse 4]
Speaking of God, at ten years old, I switched church homes
The bishop was tweaking, and we was Baptist
So how you a bishop? Like technically speaking
You drove a white Rolls, me and my family was type broke
The difference between having a home and not having a home was a tightrope
Visiting Catholic Churches, the masses was quiet as mice so
The minister spoke with no microphone
They had no choir, so silent I thought I heard Christ go
'You need a messiah'
Ran out the house from hormones, you seven months pregnant with Ryan
I figured I'd go to the East by my T for some peace and quiet
I ended up running the streets with my cousins, sitting in the back
Listening to beats, scheming on schemes that came to pass
They strategy murder yourselves, don't fall according to stats
I pray the new plots clear and thick as bulletproof glass
Cause the worst part of death is ambitions are dashed
Keep speaking death, it'll start to seem like the new car you wanna buy
It starts popping up on your way to work, see it all the time, always passing by
Call it playing Beetle-bug, yeah, it's on sight, better throw a punch
Running late to Teterboro, made the plane wait because it's no rush
Clouds floating over oceans from above
Kinda looks like bubbles on a tub
Kinda like…
