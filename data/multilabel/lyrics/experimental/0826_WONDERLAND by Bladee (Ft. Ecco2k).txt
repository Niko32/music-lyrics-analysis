Innocence and evil superglued together
Swallowing my feelings tastes like sweetness

[Verse 1: Bladee]
If you were to tell a story, how would it go?
Would I be in it? Yes or no?
It feels like springtime in my mind
It feels like summer all the time (Oh)
Wonderland
Wonderland (Oh)

I break the wall (I break the wall)
When I wish upon a star (When I wish upon a star)
And they look in awe (Look in awe)
Aw man, yeah, I did it for the art (For the art)
Yeah, I'm charged up (Trash Star)
Charged up, you can say I'm starstruck (Starstruck)
I go in the night
Just to make it work out (Just to make it work out)
