You think the end of the world is coming?

[Blaise Bailey Finnegan III]
The preacher man says it's the end of time
He says that America's rivers are going dry
The interest is up, the stock market's down
You guys gotta be careful walking around here this late at night

[Beggar Woman]
Spare change? Spare change?

[Blaise Bailey Finnegan III]
This— no we don't, ma'am, I'm sorry
This— This— This is the perfect place to get jumped

[Interviewer]
But do you think the end of the world is coming?

[Blaise Bailey Finnegan III]
No

Deliver us from the gathering storm
Unworthy though we are
Leave us living safe and warm
And sheltered in your arms

Fallen out of grace are we
Sinless never more to be
Deliver us from the gathering storm
Unworthy though we are

Deliver us from the shadows and fear
And brighten us our night
O lift us out of the valley of sin
And leave our path in light
