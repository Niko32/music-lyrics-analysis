A-N-T-I-I-C-O-N, no one on my level

[Verse 1]
Keep on believing, you been believing in a lie
Everybody depending on me, I don't know why
Barely made it out of my bed, why do I try?
I said I never told a lie, but I did when I told you that I was doin' just fine
Red blood, somethin' I don't really care for
Let it all run wild like it's meant for
Fake love, somethin' I don't really care for
Let it all hang out, find me another motherfucker who ain't an overrated fabricated A.I

[Bridge]
I said a lie when I said I'm fine
Anti-everything you love

[Verse 2]
Love-drunk, numb from the waist up (Please stop)
Pain loss, thank God and please don't (Please don't)
Pray, let him prey on the brain, don't let him eat
If that's an icon, that'll never be me (Yeah)

[Chorus]
Anti-everything you, anti-everything you
Anti-everything you, anti-everything you (Fuck yeah)
Anti-everything you, anti-everything you
Anti-everything you

(Anti-everything you, anti-everything you)
(Anti-everything you, anti-everything you)
(Anti-everything you, anti-everything you)
(Anti-everything you, anti-everything you)
(Anti-everything you)
