Pedalling through
The dark currents
I find an accurate copy
A blueprint of the pleasure in me

[Chorus 1]
(Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
A secret code carved
A secret code carved (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)

[Verse 2]
He offers a handshake
Crooked five fingers
They form a pattern
Yet to be matched

[Chorus 2]
On the surface simplicity (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
But the darkest pit in me
And it's pagan poetry (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
Pagan poetry

[Verse 3]
Morse coding signals (Signals)
They pulsate (They wake me up)
They wake me up
(Pulsate) from my hibernating
You might also like[Chorus 2]
On the surface simplicity (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
But the darkest pit in me
And it's pagan poetry (Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
Pagan poetry
(Swirling black lilies totally ripe)
(Swirling black lilies totally ripe)

[Outro]
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him, I
