See this confidence ain't getting to my mind
I can see you crossing fingers, I ain't blind
Already tried so many times
Hold on to your feelings, I'ma watch 'em die
See I ain't switching lanes
Now I've tried to explain
But there's no point tryna change you
Fuck your money, fuck your fame
Fuck your money, fuck your fame

[Interlude 1: Bobby Raps]
What's more to life than a couple of thrills?
Back of my mind, what if none of it's real?

[Verse 2: Bobby Raps]
Play the hand that I'm dealt, ignore how it unfold
When it’s time to go, I guess it’s time to go
Fuck I look like?
I don’t do what I’m told
I don’t need to get saved, I put that on my soul
Need to get you a grip
You don’t got a good hold
Spend a new day getting old
The only thing that's less forgiving than time
Is the weather forever? I’m stuck in the cold
It’s only getting colder and colder
And faster and faster
And when I first realized it, it was like a natural disaster
And after I pass on
I hope they roll up and light it
And ash in the casket
'Cause none of this matters
I don't think none of this matters

[Verse 3: Bobby Raps]
See it’s obvious that you can’t play your part
I knew I never should have tried to take your heart
So insecure about me in your mind
Scared of love in this journey
Make it 'til we die, well
Think you got me figured out
Only thing I can do now
Is take advantage of the doubt
You think that I'm one thing
You think that I'm nothing
Just too worried about my damn self

[Verse 4: Corbin]
Say why I’ve lost
Can’t believe what you don’t fucking know
Best believe I’m never short
So you waste no effort then
When the mirror got you home
That you won’t need to whistle then
