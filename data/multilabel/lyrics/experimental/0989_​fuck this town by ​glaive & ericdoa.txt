Woah-oh, woah
Oh-woah, oh-woah
Ayy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh, woah, oh-woah

[Verse 1: ericdoa & glaive]
I turn my home into a ghost town
Maybe that's why every single person going ghost now
I've been working too hard, why the fuck would I slow down?
People only care about you when it's about to go down

[Chorus: glaive & ericdoa]
Said, "Fuck this town and, like, everyone in it"
You say you're mad at me, I'm just minding my business
She wanna dance with the devil but won't pay him a visit
I bet I'll see him soon 'cause the way that I'm living
Said, "Fuck this town and, like, everyone in it"
You say you're mad at me, I'm just minding my business
She wanna dance with the devil but won't pay him a visit
I bet I'll see him soon 'cause the way that I'm living

[Verse 2: ericdoa & glaive]
Try to find a way to get on by
No, we don't talk no more, said I crossed the line
Throwing your weight on me, yeah
Figure out what to say, calmly
Yeah, you're always someone you're not
Remember three months ago, they didn't care when I talked
And all this shit I can't control, yeah, I wish it would stop
And I'm never coming back, because
You might also like[Chorus: glaive & ericdoa]
Said, "Fuck this town and, like, everyone in it"
You say you're mad at me, I'm just minding my business
She wanna dance with the devil but won't pay him a visit
I bet I'll see him soon 'cause the way that I'm living
Said, "Fuck this town and, like, everyone in it"
You say you're mad at me, I'm just minding my business
She wanna dance with the devil but won't pay him a visit
I bet I'll see him soon 'cause the way that I'm living

[Outro: glaive & ericdoa]
Fuck this town and like everyone in it
I'm just minding my business
She wanna dance with the devil but won't pay him a visit
We won't pay him a visit
