Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh
Uh-oh, uh-oh

[Verse 1: Dina Emerson]
Yo, I'm ropin' up my saddle for the long, long ride
Every time I see the desert there's something inside says
Yo, yo, this is the life, give me open land and a big ol' knife
To get some bear, deer, even a snake!
I light me a fire, do the shake and bake
I say, "Yo, yo" I'm a cowboy now
The sun is hot and dry, gonna rope me a cow
I say, "Yo, yo" I'm loose and free
Whoa there Nelly, you're the horse for me!

[Chorus: Dina Emerson]
Rope 'em up boys
The desert is a callin'
Yahoo, yahoo, yahoo
(Saddle up fellas)
The desert is a callin'
Yahoo, yahoo, yahoo

[Refrain: Children's Choir]

[Verse 2: Dina Emerson]
Out on the plains, just me and my mind
Took me a break to read some Wittgenstein
Born in Vienna in '89
He obsessed with theories of language and time
Like the Tractatus where Ludwig would claim
"The logic of our language is misunderstood"
Philosophy is based on a false pretence
So philosophy itself is nonsense, nonsense!
Philosophy itself is non-sense!

[Chorus: Dina Emerson]
Bedeutung ist tun
Es ist ein Sprachspiel
Nonsense! Nonsense!
Wörter sind Inhalt
Jawohl! Jawohl!
[Refrain: Children's Choir]
Yom Kippur! Yom Kippur!
Self reflection and atonement
Yom Kippur, that's what for
Do all your shopping
At Wal-Mart!
[Bridge: Children's Choir & Dina Emerson]
(Oh, say, "Can you—") Feel the embers glowing
And the turkey in the oven!
(America!) Hear the children singing
There's a turkey in the oven!
(Rockets red glare!) Candles are so pretty
And a turkey in the oven!
Do all your shopping at Wal-Mart!
(Buy spurs that jingle at Wal-Mart!)

[Refrain: Children's Choir]
Ramadan! Ramadan!
Lots of praying with no breakfast!

[Verse 3: Dina Emerson]
It's home, home on the big ol' range
Yippee tai oh, get along there stranger
Rope 'em, ride 'em, shoot 'em up good!
We're big and bad in the cowboy 'hood
I say, "Yo, yo" got a river to ford
With a life like this I never be bored
I say, "Yo, yo" I'm wild and free
Whoa Miss Kitty you're the gal for me!
[Chorus: Dina Emerson]
Woah, Miss Kitty
I say, "Woah" there
Woah, Miss Kitty
Yahoo! Yahoo!

Go and tell her that you love her!
Do all your shopping at Wal-Mart!

[Verse 4: Dina Emerson]
Look out there, it's an Injun band!
Coming this way, gonna fight for my land
And build a home town grocery store
American cheese, worth fighting for
Call it "dry gulch" O.K. Corral
Holiday spot for you and your gal
To get some cool shit and desert rays
Cowboy livin' the American Way!

[Interlude: Dina Emerson & Children's Choir]
It's a cowboy living
(Go! Go!)
It's cowboy living
(Go! Go!)
It's cowboy living
(All the way!)

People!
Coming together out of a desire to obtain political power!
Vice Presidential Candidate!
Twenty-seven electoral votes!
Central policy issues!
Two party system!
Struggle!
Gain control of the government!
Executive branch!
Military branch!
Foreign affairs!
Influence policy!
Promote ideology; fascism!
Promote individual interests;
George Stephanopoulous, Imelda Marcos!
Promote special interests;
Sugar, Beef, Bananas, Lumber, Pork bellies, Pork barrels, Coca-Cola!
The information superhighway!
Three thousand years of oppression!
Who enslaved people of color?
Who invaded the Caribbean?
Who murdered all the innocent children?!
You did! You! You! You!

[Outro: Group]
It may be you
It could be me
It's not enough
To wait and see
And when we all
Lock arms and sing
Then bells of freedom
Ring ding ding!
(It may be you!)
It may be you
(It could be me!)
It could be me
(It's not enough!)
It's not enough
(To wait and see!)
To wait and see
(And when we all!)
And when we all
(Lock arms and sing!)
Lock arms and sing
(Then bells of freedom!)
Then bells of freedom
(Ring ding ding!)
Ring ding ding!
