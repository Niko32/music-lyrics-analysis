Tell my heart to only let you go
From the start, you only wanted more
Tell my heart to only let you go
From the start, you only wanted more

[Chorus]
So tell me do you know
Before you get to the Sun
Wherever you will go
It's always been for you

[Verse]
Tell my heart to only let you go
From the start, you only wanted more
Tell my heart to only let you go
From the start, you only wanted more

[Chorus]
So tell me do you know
Before you get to the Sun
Wherever you will go
It's always been for you
So tell me do you know
Before you get to the Sun
Wherever you will go
It's always been for youYou might also like
