(Dreaming in a dream)
Go (Three Star)
Go, go, go (Star)
Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go, go

[Chorus]
Go around
Merry-go-round
It's all in my head, got imaginary friends (Go, imaginary)
I'm stuck in a trance
I can only dance
Castles made of cards and I watch it go down
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round (In the)
Merry-go-round (Merry-go)
Merry-go-round (Yeah)
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
In the merry-go-round

[Verse]
Time will stand still
Wish you dance doing ballet
I come in, open up and I fall in
It's like silk, in the wind, flowers swaying
In the ring, in perfect union
It's like love, it's just like in a fairytale
Not enough, it's just not true enough
Catch a breath, I can't even breathe, baby
Feels so fresh, just one and only one
You might also like[Chorus]
Go around, go
Merry-go-round
It's all in my head, got imaginary friends
I'm stuck in a trance
I can only dance
Castles made of cards and I watch it go down
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round (In the merry-go-round)
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round (Merry-go-round)
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round (In the merry-go)
Merry-go-round
Merry-go-round (Go)
Merry-go-round (Go, go, in the merry)
Merry-go-round (Go, go)
Merry-go-round (Go, go)
(Go, uh)
