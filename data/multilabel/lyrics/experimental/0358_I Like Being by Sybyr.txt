In a world, oh-so distant

[Chorus]
I like being broken in a world, oh-so distant
I like being fucked in the head, so pathetic
All I wanna do is bounce up on some stock shit
And keep on climbing up, then go crash like the spaceships

[Post-Chorus]
"Fuck that dude Syringe, all he do is go scream and shit"
I just like the pain in your ears when you stay listenin'
Fuck it, who am I? Why do I even try shit?
Maybe it's because I gotta lotta fuckin' spite in me

[Interlude]
All I know is doubling the damage
Seems like we should try being more savage
My brain don't wanna think, I just want break shit (Oh, no, no)
Press upon your body as I weaken it

[Verse]
Still going off, now, where did my top go? (Woah, woah)
I never noticed if I became psycho (Woah, woah)
All I wanna do is fuck you and bite you
Scream my name a thousand times as I plow through
I'm a horny motherfucker with issues (Yeah)
I need to get me some tissues (Yeah)
I keep on leaving my dick bruised (Yeah)
Maybe I'm liking the thought of you
Either way, I need to get away
Good thing I'm taking a vacay
Don't ever call me by my name
I don't think anyone cares, ayy
Either way, I need to get away
Good thing I'm taking a vacay
Don't ever call me by my name
I don't think anyone cares, ayy, ayy

"Fuck thatâ€”, fuck that dude Syringe, all he do is go scream and shit"
