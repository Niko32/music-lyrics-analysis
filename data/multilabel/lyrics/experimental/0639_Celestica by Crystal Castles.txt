As we fall into sequence
And we're eating our young
Remain silent and still for modesty
When the splints have been broken
And they can't help you now
Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally?

[Chorus]
Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care

[Verse 2]
If I'm lost please don't find me
If I drown let me sink
We descended from no one
With a wink
Do you pray with your eyes closed naturally?

[Bridge]
When it's cold outside hold me, don't hold me
When I choose to rest my eyes coax me, don't coax me
When it's cold outside hold me, don't hold me
When I choose to rest my eyes coax me, don't coax me

[Chorus]
Follow me into nowhere
Woven with the utmost care

And scrubbed behind the knees?
Has your body been hollowed by the breeze?

[Outro]
When I choose to rest my eyes
