It's true, in this life
I've never been the one in your eyes
I've never been the truth
All you saw was a broken mirror
And they told me to care
When tryin' to fix your heart
It's unfair
I'm tryin' to fix myself
And not care too much about you

[Verse]
It's true, in this life
I've never been the one in your eyes
I've never been the truth
All you saw was a broken mirror
And they told me to care
When tryin' to fix your heart
It's unfair
I'm tryin' to fix myself
And not care too much about you

[Outro]
He never really wanted me to be his wife
I was nothing more than a trophy
It was incredibly suffocating
I’d find myself wanting him
Rather dead than alive…You might also like
