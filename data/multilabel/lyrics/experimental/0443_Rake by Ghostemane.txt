Find me face down in a fucking gutter, throw me away
I'm so sick of waking up, I just might fucking stop
I've got red on my fingertips and I'll stay cursed 'til I fucking drop

[Verse]
Every morning feel like hell again
Fucking everything up, I don't know where to begin
Paralyzed, heartache took a toll on me again
Then I found a pretty bitch with that ghost white skin
Casper annihilate me 'til I'm dead
I need something to believe in again
I'm but a shell of myself with no head
I see it rolling away from me right into those (Hands)
Fuck 'til my dick fall off, ayy
Ate her 'til my face went numb
Hand around her throat, watch her pupils blacken
Then I'm back up in her soul 'til the cum flow go then her face go
(Red!)
Ayy, nails on my chest, blood flow
Shawty had me looking like a Freddy victim (Looking like a Freddy victim)

[Bridge]
1, 2, 3, go
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, ayy, ayy

One by one, you're all going down
I'll make you see
Traveling alone since birth and
I've never felt so liberated!

[Outro]
(Fuck!)
