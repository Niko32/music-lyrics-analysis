I think about when we die
Do we realize that we've already closed our eyes
So I hold everything
A little bit closer on this roller-coaster
Everything falls apart sometimes
But everything seems so fine in my mind
Time in time again I will find
Memories will climb my spine
Stealing everything that once was mine
Time and time again
I will find
Standing here under stars
To me, they seem so far
Tell me who they are
Tell me why do we go to the war

So I hold everything
A little bit closer on this roller-coaster

Everything falls apart sometimes
But Everything seems so fine in my mind
Time in time again I will find
Memories will climb my spine
Stealing everything that once was mine
Time and time again
I will find
