What's your favorite idea?
Mine is being creative
How do you get the idea?
I just try to think creatively

[Verse 1: The Notepad & Duck Guy]
Now when you look at this orange
Tell me, please, what do you see?
It's just a boring, old orange
Maybe to you but not to me

[Verse 2: The Notepad, Yellow Guy & Duck Guy]
I see a silly face (Wow)
Walking along and smiling at me
I don't see what you mean
'Cause you're not thinking creatively

[Verse 3: The Notepad, Red Guy & Yellow Guy & Red Guy]
So take a look at my hair (Cool)
I use my hair to express myself
That sounds really boring
I use my hair to express myself

[Interlude: The Notepad, Red Guy, Yellow Guy & Duck Guy, Red Guy & Yellow Guy]
Now when you stare at the clouds in the sky
Don't you find it exciting?
No
Come on, take another look
Oh, wait
I can see a hat
I can see a cat
I can see a man with a baseball bat
I can see a dog
I can see a frog
I can see a ladder leaning on a log

Think you're getting the hang of it now
Using your minds to have a good time
I might paint a picture of a clown
Whoa there, friend, you might need to slow down

[Verse 5: The Notepad & Yellow Guy & Duck Guy]
Here's another good tip (Yeah?)
Of how to be a creative whiz kid
Go and collect some leaves and sticks
And arrange them into your favorite color

[Verse 6: Red Guy, Duck Guy, Yellow Guy & The Notepad]
Blue
Red
Green
Green is not a creative color
There's one more thing that you need to know
Before you let your creativity flow
Listen to your heart, listen to the rain
Listen to the voices in your brain
Come on, guys, let's get creative

[Bridge: The Notepad]
Get creative
[Outro: The Notepad]
Now let's all agree
To never be creative again
