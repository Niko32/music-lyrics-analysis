I was crossed in the border, to old friend coincidence
I don't want any other, two old friend coincidences

[Pre-Chorus: Julian Casablancas]
Weekday, weekday, weekday
I don't wanna play any other game
Born a simpler day

[Chorus: Julian Casablancas]
It's not right, it's not true, it's not right
It's not how we used to do
It's not true, it's not right
It's not how we used to do
It's not true, it's not right
It's not how we used to do

[Bridge: Julian Casablancas]
What he does, he does well
He does well and he knows, he knows it
Lay down, just lay down

[Verse: 2: Julian Casablancas]
I was crossed in the border, we were waiting in a line
I don't want any other, two old friend coincidencеs
Voice inside my head, dinnеr's at mine or yours?

Weekday, weekday, weekday
I don't wanna say, what he wants to know
Born a simpler day

[Chorus: Julian Casablancas]
It's not right, it's not true, it's not right
It's not how we used to do
It's not true, it's not right
It's not how we used to do
It's not true, it's not right
It's not how we used to do
It's not true, it's not right (I won't need nothing, I won't need nothing)
It's not how we used to do (I won't need nothing, I won't need no-o-o-o-thing)
It's not true, it's not right (You won't mean nothing, you won't mean nothing)
It's not how we used to do (You won't mean nothing, you won't mean no-o-o-o-thing)
It's not true, it's not right
It's not how we used to do
It's not true, it's not right
It's not how we used to do
It's not true, it's not right
It's not how we used to do
