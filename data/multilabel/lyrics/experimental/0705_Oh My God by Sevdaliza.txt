Oh, my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to Hell
Oh, my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to Hell
Oh, my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to Hell

[Verse]
I've been through a lot in life
I lived, loved
Distant from it all
I view myself from above
Roamin' in the fields of hope
Will it make or break me?
'Cause my dreams are heavy, they outweigh you and me (잊지 마', спасибо)

Oh, my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to Hell
Oh, my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to Hell

[Bridge]
You, you're, you're not alone
You, you're, you're not alone
(Will it make or break me?)
You, you're, you're not alone
You, you're, you're not alone

[Chorus]
O-o-oh, my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to Hell
Oh, my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to Hell
[Bridge]
You, you're, you're not alone
잊지 마', спасибо
You, you're, you're not alone

[Chorus]
Oh, my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to Hell
Oh, my God
Who should I be?
What is it you want when you come for me?
Every time, you're another evil
Waiting for an angel that you bring to Hell
