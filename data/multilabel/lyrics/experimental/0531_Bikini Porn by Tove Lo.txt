Uh-uh
Uh-uh

[Verse 1]
Uh-uh, I'm all bikini porn
Uh-uh, layin' out in the sun
Oh, I got those marks on my body
You-ooh, you're looking pale as fuck
You-ooh, like you're all out of luck
Oh, you got those sad eyes for money

[Pre-Chorus]
Run around in your boring bubble
Scared to pop it, you think I'm trouble, na-na-na
Time to time, I know you'll be dreaming, na-na-na
"What would life be if I just go with her?"

[Chorus]
All I do is drink champagne all day, all day, all day
And I dance around my room naked, oh yeah, naked
Skinny dippin' in the pool with me, with me, with me
Take a day out from your life all day, one day, today

[Verse 2]
Uh-uh, I'm all bikini porn
Uh-uh, now my bikini's gone
Oh, I got you tangled around me
You-ooh, you quit your office job
You-ooh, half-naked, take it off
Oh, you rollin' free with no worries
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Run around in your boring bubble
Scared to pop it, you think I'm trouble, na-na-na
Time to time, I know you'll be dreaming, na-na-na
"What would life be if I just go with her?"

[Chorus]
All I do is drink champagne all day, all day, all day
And I dance around my room naked, oh yeah, naked
Skinny dippin' in the pool with me, with me, with me
Take a day out from your life all day, one day, today

[Bridge]
(Uh-uh) I don't pick up when the phone calls
(Uh-uh) I got glitter in my eyeballs
I got you tangled around me, uh, uh
(You-ooh) You don't need another minute
(You-ooh) Hit the skin and then you're in it
You rollin' free with no worries

[Chorus]
All I do is drink champagne all day, all day, all day
And I dance around my room naked, oh yeah, naked
Skinny dippin' in the pool with me, with me, with me
Take a day out from your life all day, one day, today
