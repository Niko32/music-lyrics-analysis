Nails
(I got nails on my side, I got nails on my back)
(I got nails on my side, I got nails on my back)
(I got nails on my side, I got nails on my back)
(I got nails on my side, I got nails on my back)

[Chorus]
I got nails on my back, scratched up like a cat attack
Throat grab, now she throw a jab, laying all blind and gagged
Life is a bitch tryna fuck (Tryna fuck)
But I don't wanna fuck, rather she suck on my dick and throw up

[Verse]
Bitch, you didn't give a fuck who I was (Who I was!)
'Til I got a bit of buzz but I'm still (Not really shit)
Fuck up anything that get up in the way of me being a level 11 mage
And I really wanna thank
(Crowley and light)
Why try? Do or die
I pretend I'm doing fine
Really, I want to get high
But I refrain 'cause it never did help me
Show a sign
That I'm meant to be alive
Looking, I can't find the light (Can't find the light)
I don't give a motherfuck about a bitch
Every bitch only want one thing from me
Back up, let me be alone
Let me self-loathe
Vulnerable soul, with nowhere to go
Nail me to the cross and watch me bleed out
I'm sick of living like I'm already dead!

I got nails on my back, scratched up like a cat attack
Throat grab, now she throw a jab, laying all blind and gagged
Life is a bitch tryna fuck (Tryna fuck)
But I don't wanna fuck, rather she suck on my dick and throw up
I got nails on my back, scratched up like a cat attack
Throat grab, now she throw a jab, laying all blind and gagged
Life is a bitch tryna fuck (Tryna fuck)
But I don't wanna fuck, rather she suck on my dick and throw up

[Outro]
I've got nails on my back
Hammering into me, when will it end?
