*crying*
Goodnight, guys
I miss you
Oh, somebody's sleepy!
Hehehehe, but that's silly!
No!
How can you be sleepy, if you don't know how to have dreams?
No, I don't want to know!
I don't want to know how to have dreams!
No!
NO!!!

[Verse 1: Lamp & Yellow Guy]
Dreams are movies that live in your head
Every night when you sleep in your bed
You can have a dream about riding a horse
Or you can have a dream about drowning in oil!
No, no, NO!
NO MORE SONGS!
Ah!

[Post-Verse 1: Lamp]
Oh! looks like somebody's having a bad dream?

[Spoken Word 1: Red Guy #1 & Red Guy #2]
Can you file these files please?
Uh, yeah. Sure
Hey
Wouldn't it be funny if, um
One of these files came alive
"I am a file, and you put documents in me"
Adoot doot doot doot
"I'm a file"
Funny, silly file
Adoot doot doot
You know, it did like a song
No
That sounds really boring

[Spoken Word 2: Red Guy #1, Red Guy #2, Red Guy #3 & Red Guy #4]
But I was like yeah
That's not even the same bucket
I am the cool guy I guess
Laid-back and sad
Nowadays
I hurt my leg today
*Red Guy walks up on stage naked.*
That's rude!
No clothes

[Verse 2: Red Guy & (Various Red Guys in the audience)]
What's your favorite idea?
Mine is being creative
How do you get the idea?
I just try to think creatively
Now when you look at this orange
Tell me please, what do you see?
*imitating Duck* It's just a boring old orange
Maybe to you, but not to me
I see a silly face (Boo!)
Walking along and smiling at me (Boo!)
*imitating Yellow Guy* I don't see what you mean
'Cause you're not thinking creatively! (I don't like it!)
So take a look at my hair (It's really not good!)
I use my hair to express myself (Boo!)
(It's not very good at all!)
*indistinct booing from multiple Red Guys*
(Boo!) (Go away!)
[Post-Verse 2: Microphone]
Don't stop now, friend!
Your voice is music to my face!

[Verse 3: Lamp]
You could have a dream about eating a drink
You could have a dream about buying a hat
You could have a dream about losing your friends
You could have a dream about burning your bread

[Verse 4: Clock, (Yellow Guy)]
Time is a tool you can put on the wall
Or wear it on your wrist
(Huh?)
The past is far behind us
(You?!?)
The future doesn't exist
Time went new and got old like history
Stuff from the past went into a mystery
(You made me die!)
But, look, a---

What's it all about, you have no idea
But everywhere you look
(NOO!)
All you see is hatred
And darkness, death, and---

[Verse 7: Steak Guy, Spinach Can, (Yellow Guy)]
---ice cream beef?
Ice cream beef makes your teeth go grey!
(AAAH!)
Doesn't matter, just throw it away!
Why not try some---
[Interlude: Duck]
---fish on my tray
WHAT? Where am  I---
[Verse 8: Space Guy, (Yellow Guy)]
We are in the universe!
(Huh?!)
Planets live inside the moon!
A rocket ship can go to space!
A rocket ship can go to the moon!

[Verse 9: Football]
Sports! Ball, let's play sports!
Cricket ball!
Red card

[Verse 10: Magnet]
I'm a magnet
And I'm friends with metal, I attract it
And it's my best friend

[Verse 11: Shovel, (Yellow Guy)]
Let's dig a hole
At the bottom of---
(MAKE IT STOP!!!)

[Verse 12: Saxophone]
Ababadoobop
I'll teach you how to buy a canoe!

[Verse 13: File Folder]
I am a file and you put documents in me

[Breakdown: Stoplight, Gel, Cigarette, Stereo, (Yellow Guy)]
---Green is for go
But red is for not go
You can be crushed by a bus---
Let's learn about gel!
I know about gel!
Stinky mouth!
Music is your favorite thing!
(Ah! No...
I don't like it...!
*scared yelling*)

[Outro: Red Guy & Notebook]
*A long yellow arm approaches the back of Red Guy. Red Guy turns around to see Roy.*
Oh!...
*Red Guy notices a long cord coming out of the side of the machine. He follows it and sees a plug. He grabs it.*
...I wonder what will happen
*Red Guy pulls the plug, rebooting the world*
