I was waiting for you, I was outside
Don't tell me what you want 'cause I know you lie
I see
I was waiting for you, on the outside
Don't tell me what you want 'cause I know you lie
I see the light
I was crying for you, on the outside
Don't tell me what you want 'cause I know you lie

[Chorus]
I'm a fallen alien
I never thought that you would be the one to tie me down
But you did
In this age of Satan
I'm searching for a light to take me home and guide me out

[Verse 2]
In the blazing sun I saw you
In the shadows hiding from yourself
When the lights are on I know you
See you're grey from all the lies you tell
Now you hold me close so tender
(I was waiting for you, I was outside)
In the shadows hiding from yourself
(I was waiting for you, I was outside)
When the lights are on I know you
See you're grey from all the lies you tell
(Don't tell me what you want 'cause I know you lie)
Now you hold me close so tender
When you fall asleep I'll kick you down
By the way you fell I know you
Now you're on your knees
I see the lightning flash

[Verse 2]
In the blazing sun I saw you
In the shadows hiding from yourself
When the lights are on I know you
See you're grey from all the lies you tell
Now you hold me close so tender
When you fall asleep I'll kick you down
By the way you fell I know you
(I was waiting for you, I was outside)
See you're grey from all the lies you tell
(Don't tell me what you want)
Now you hold me close so tender
When you fall asleep I'll kick you down
By the way you fell I know you
Now you're on your knees
I see the lightning flash
