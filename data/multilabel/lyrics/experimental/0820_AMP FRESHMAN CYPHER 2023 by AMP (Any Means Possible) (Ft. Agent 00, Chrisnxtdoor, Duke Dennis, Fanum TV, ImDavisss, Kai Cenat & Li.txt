(Kaysan)
(You know who did?)
(GOD DID, God Did, GOD DID)
(Lee, Kailer)
You know, when it comes to what I do
Everything I do, I do it serious, nigga
I don't give a fuck what I got going on
When it comes to this content shit, I don't play no games, nigga
I’ma give people what they want every single time and that's my all, you hear me?
Turn me up

[Verse: Kai Cenat]
One week, four cars, one team, six stars
Big Lambo' in the garage, court sittin' front yard
AP on the arm, I done came so far
AP on the arm, I done came so far
Shit like GTA and I ain't even got no mods (Damn)
Why the fuck you gon' tell me how to beat the odds?
Backcourt like MJ while I'm here throwin' lobs
Bitches throwin' it back like they throwin' on some rods
Five percent for the truck, yeah-yeah
She callin' my phone, talkin' bout she tryna fuck
How you tryna fuck when yo' baby daddy stuck?
Hold up, hold up, hold up, fuck that nigga
Bitch, I'm tryna fuck
Now, lets talk about this streaming shit 'cause niggas gettin' soft
I do my own thing and I'll put that on the cross
They offered me forty, I told them, "Double it for more"
Then Rumble came and started knockin' right on that door
Before you talk on me, ask yourself, "Are we the same?"
I'm not here to play any motherfuckin' games
Niggas come up and start turnin' lame
I would never switch up or go for the fame
Six watches, plus two homes
Now I got ten bitches and they all callin' my three phones
Neck say “AMP”, so you know we fuckin' all of these hoes
Like warfare, she givin' me dome (Like warfare, she givin' me dome)
Like warfare, she givin' me dome (Kaysan)

[Verse: Agent00]
Went to Alabama to fuck all of my cousins
Went to play with men overseas like DeMarcus Cousins
I'd buy it right now, but it's cheaper by the dozen
I'm not from Russia, why are we rushing?
Eh, all this extra cash, so I bought me a Benz
She tryna fuck with me because of who I am
Nuts like peanut butter but who's my jam?
Damn, I just got on a yacht, that's a big boat
I just put on a cozy Mink coat
I got my dill in her mouth, that's a pickle
Woo, Scooby-Doo, Scooby-Doo
I'm finna eat my bitch like a Scooby Snack
You can't run from me, bring that booty back
Hee, beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep-beep
I'm movin' on a highway, drivin' in high speeds
These niggas are my sons, I put 'em in a high seat
I'm crushin' on this hoe like orange, not like Hi-C
I'm hatin' on this nigga, someone get his IP
She drain me on my nuts, someone get the IV
Don't see no competition, yeah, your money's tiny
Ah-boo-da-ba, da-boo-da-ba, da-boo-da-ba, bee
He shoot like Ben Simmons, we gon' send him overseas
Hit her from the back, I like her better on her knees
Beat a nigga ass for talkin' shit in Japanese
Kono niga bagin!
I've been winnin' so long, since Rage was pluggin'
Shorty wanna go on dates, bitch, when we fuckin?
Minute man, three strokes, I think I'm cum— Eughh

(Ayy-Ayy Kevlar, that muhfucker fire)
(I wish Kevlar cooked the beat)
(Ooh, Hanna)

[Verse: Duke Dennis]
Boy, a nigga done made me mad, so I smashed on his momma and I'm fuckin' on his bitch
Almost fucked his baby momma too, that nigga ain't tried me since
Ridin' through the trenches, stand on business, five percent this tinted
If you my dawg, won't cross you out or backdoor, you a 'bout a bitch
If you my dawg, won't cross you out or backdoor, you a 'bout a hoe
One of ‘em rap, one of 'em act, I'm that nigga, I fucked 'em both
Really been chillin', might fuck up the city if my niggas with it
I'm outside, wrist and mouth be glistenin', cost a couple digits
Yo' IG crush be in my DM tryna fuck some
I put my chain around my neck whenever I fuck on her
Your bro a bitch, we use that nigga just for store runs
Come shoot your shot at me, I promise I won't say nun'
You let these hoes play in your face and then it's game over
I'm reppin' Dee Block, AMP, so I can't change on 'em
Can't stay the same, bro, I got brain while in the Range Rover
Stay in my lane, these niggas lame, so they be hatin' on me
I tell my young niggas to chill, so shit won't pop off
Ever since I put on Ritz, bitch, I’ve been feelin' like a rockstar
Baby, you are not my bitch, so I don't give a fuck 'bout your roster
If I'm not who you with, then I don't give a fuck about you
These internet niggas, they won't try me, 'cause they know what's up
You say my name, we do some shit, then you gon' know it’s us
I call Davo, and I call Dre, them niggas get to bustin'
Ain't with that soft shit, tell that bitch we can't hold hands in public
I'on fuck with IG hoes, 'cause them hoes don’t mind they business
They be all up in my likes, my comments, even in my mentions
I'on like the public or social media in my business
If I find out that you ran your mouth about me, bitch, you finished (Like, bitch, you gone, ayy)
(Get off my phone, ayy)
(Delete my number, bitch, you blocked, leave me alone, ayy)
(Like, bitch, you gone, ayy)
[Part IV: SCENIC]

[Verse: Chrisnxtdoor]
Say, gettin' money really is a mindset
I was livin' up in poverty, nigga, think my mindset
Nxtdoor, he next up, swear that nigga loadin' in
Only kids watch your content, you like Nickelodeon
Niggas pocket watchin' so, fuck nigga, watch 'em grow
Got that Cali Swag District, hit that dougie in your hoe
Ooh, ooh, I could ride off in a new coupe, vroom, vroom
See that envy in your face, like Charlamagne interview
Try and knock me off my balance, but I kept my solid
I'm no DJ Khaled, but I know that God did
Crib with a pool, court, skyline view, shit
Feel like Clark sisters, blessed than highly favorite
Brace and hit a nigga head like a Carti moshpit
She an animal, she eat the dick like ostrich

[Part V]

[Verse: Chrisnxtdoor]
Mhm, okay, mhm, uh, uh, okay
I been makin' plays so long, I feel like Gregg Pop'
Stayin' on my spurs, don't let that hate get to my headtop
That boy got that clock and my money stretch like Wemby
I could do anything, I got the Lord with me
I cut my ex bitch off, now she feel offended
She love me like anime hoes love CoryxKenshin
Uh, and that's the difference
Even if I had a clone I'd still be different
Mama said, "Please, don't lose your focus" I got used to poppin, I got hurt, now I got purpose
Damn, nigga, please shut the fuck up 'bout my damn knee
You don't get no hoes in your career, you just like A. C. Green
Hippopotamus was in the mud, now I'm super clean
Now my whole damn life is like a movie scene
Alright, lemme, lemme, lemme chill the fuck out, my, my, my
I think my dad might be watchin', I gotta stop cursin'

[Part Vl: KING OF THE CITY]

[Intro: ImDavisss]
I can't hear that well
I can't hear it
I can't hear that well, damn
(MikeFuture, you flying through)

[Verse: ImDavisss]
I'm at the top of the hill like, what? Bitch, I'm the king of the city
I'm at a steakhouse to eat brunch, I’ll take her out 'cause she pretty
They ain't believe in the kid from the start, but you know God did it
And you know God, what? Ayy, and you know God did it
Ayy, ayy, I ran it up like I’m Diddy, uh, know they talkin' down in your shit
Lucky I'm even attending, ayy, ayy
AMP on the pendant, ayy, niggas mad that we trendin', ayy
I just ran me another fifty, ayy
Fifty, fifty, fifty K and it’s gone, uh, that's a purse for my mom
No, we can't get along, all you bitches are wrong
Make the whole team rich, ayy
Pray my brothers never switch, ayy, pray my brothers never switch
(MikeFuture, you flying through)
Ayy, I been racking up, uh, see that how I made a milly in my second month
I see the hate comments, I don't really give a fuck
Woulda copped it, nigga, Elon, where my cybertruck?
I'm 'bout to switch up the flow
I might just give it a go
Everyday thank God, 'cause only God'll know
I been gettin' to it, never satisfied, I need mo'
They ain't hearin' what I'm sayin', so I guess I got to show 'em
Wake up in the mornin' and make a play
Only conflict I'm havin' is what I’m gon' wear today
I gotta concentrate, gotta get my mind straight
I ran it up, whole team get a plate

[Part VIl: IT JUST MAKES SENSE]

[Intro: Fanum]
(Kaysan)
Got that shit on me right now
(Nealante)
Wanum, Wanum, Wanum
Ayy
(Trill got that juice, nigga)

[Verse: Fanum]
Ayy, I always gotta eat good, I'm a food enthusiast
This is not an act, baby, I really do this shit
Never tote a high point, it's unreliable
I love me a Glock-19, that’s gon' fire on you
We got the drop on your lo’, yeah we had the bet that
7.62's, like Kai I'ma Cenat
I'm not tied to the streets, but I keep ties to the streets
Walk out the club with my chains on, she wanna ride with me
Throw the shades on, when I spit, I think I'm Pluto
Beat a nigga like karate, yeah, I'm talkin' judo
I never ate at Arby's, I am not Caucasian
I'm black, brown and proud and I fuck with Blasians
But I'm not a racist, I fuck on all races
I wear ride ups with Denim tears, then I fix my laces
I'm in Tokyo, my chauffeur Japanese
All this money got me speakin' that Guapanese
I got a happy endin', shorty on her knees
Kudasai, mhm, that mean she sayin' please
Damn, and it just make sense, I only like Benjamins, lil' nigga, you can keep the cents
Damn, and it just make sense
My lil' nigga, he'll crash out, he don't got no sense
It just make sense, damn
Ayy, I know when a nigga fake, I could feel it
I know when she ‘bout to nut, I could feel it
I only fear God, lil' nigga, I would never fear you
I pray you get your life together, shit, I dare you
I made a mill' off GTA, now I live like Michael
My niggas only wanna shoot, they don't wanna fight you
Police get up on my ass and I'ma get to swervin'
Why this bitch think I'm broke, I won't buy her a birkin
I know them old niggas mad, they ain't believe in me
They see me pop out with they hoes, they wanna be with me
I'm rawdogging my bitch, she gon' text me, she late
If you owe me some money, it’s cool, just don't be late
Goin' for a money jog in my big thirtys
I hate Twitter people, they weird, them niggas all dirty
I'ma go to the moon with this shit, call me Neil Armstrong
I bench 315 real easy, I really think my arms strong
I be doin' white lines, I ain't talkin' cocaine
All that money you gettin', it makin' you less lame
She got a girlfriend lookin' at me, I think she bisexual
I hate groupy niggas in the club, they try to get right next to you

[Outro: Fanum]
Yeah, that hard? (Kaysan)
Ayy, free Rio, nigga, free the inspiration, man
AMP shit, man, cypher shit, man
Fuck is wrong with y'all niggas?

[Verse: Lil Yachty]
Same nigga breakin' down hoes left and right (Yeah)
I was countin' up an M on a private flight (Yeah)
All this Chrome on my body like a medieval knight (Hmm)
I was fuckin' up a sack on that purple Sprite (Yeah)
All my bitches been official, even tote a pistol
Even blow up like a whistle, lie to officials
I'll drip you down in crystals if I know you're real (Mwah)
How you geekin' out your body off a pink pill?
I caught you lying, tell me and I'll fuck with you still (Damn)
So many properties I bought, I'm king of the hill
Fuck nigga need to learn his place, 'fore we put 'em in it
Steppin' and swaggin', I'm runnin' shit, I might run for senate
I got a bitch up in the kitchen, wearin' them coochie cutters (Yeah)
Free my doggy out that cell, straight up out the gutter (Sweet)
Been them niggas ever since the position needed fillin'
And I fear I didn't see it, it was just me and Dylan
You see, it was just me and Justin (Drive)
Grippin' her hair while she talkin', might give her concussion (Yeah)
I don't like discussions (Damn), I'm too rich for fussin' (Exactly)
Look her dead in her eyes and have that pussy bustin' (Yeah)

Lifestyle shit get twisted, I been livin' shady (Creep)
I been beatin' up that sack like I'm Devin Haney (Beat it)
I don't need a rock friend, I'ma step solo (Facts)
I try anything once the lifestyle YOLO
I don't wanna be posted on the blogs, I don't wanna answer calls
I did this shit for my dawgs, I just beat up the mall
I just beat up my wrist, I was duckin' IRS
I was takin’ that risk, I was takin' that bitch
I was flyin' Air Drake, so I was takin' that switch (Brrt) (Bitch, yeah)
They gave me M's at eighteen, ain't know what to do
I fuck a sack up at a jeweler, I was goin' stupid
Fell in love with a teller, I don't know cupid
Gotta tell my stepper "No'', 'cause he'll really do it
Anywhere, everywhere, he don't give a damn
Empty the clip, reload the clip, we call it sleight of hand (Yeah)
My memory bad, so I'm fuckin baby on cam'
Bottega coat, I copped, R.I.P to couple M's
That boy is not a kingpin, he sold a couple grams
He ain't no gangster, grew up better than Adonis Graham

[Outro: Lil Yachty]
It's us
