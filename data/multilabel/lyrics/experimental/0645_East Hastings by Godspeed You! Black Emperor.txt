God love this country, the United States, the world
And all the billionaires
If money could buy happiness, my love, then we'll have it
But praise God
It's only salvation, it's only Jesus Christ
Holy Hallelujah, holy Jesus Christ (Nah, I'm not up for this)
God give us peace, happiness, and love (I believe in Jesus!)
And joy in our souls
No matter what we have, no matter the money
No matter the riches of the world
It cannot buy, it cannot buy what we want—
Thank you
But the price of not realizing what we want
And what we need is the love of Jesus Christ
With the love of Jesus Christ
Hallelujah
I don't care what you have in the world
For if you don't have Jesus then we'd all be lost
We don't have the happiness and joy
If we don't have Jesus Christ, we don't have nothing
Nothing is alright in our life
Nothing-nothing, nothing-nothing
If we don't have Jesus in our life
