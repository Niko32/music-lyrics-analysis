The sunrise insists on gladness
But how can I be glad?
Now my flower is dead
Oh, Sun, I see you happy
You made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth
I don't want to believe you

[Verse 1]
The night has the power
To hold all your helplessness in
Heaven
The darkness and sadness
Hold to each other 'til tomorrow

[Chorus]
The sunrise insists on gladness
But how can I be glad?
Now my flower is dead
Oh, Sun, I see you happy
You made the morning dew
Now you're showing me the truth
But I don't want to believe you

[Verse 2]
Death, take me with you
I don't wanna live without my flower
Tomorrow, tomorrow
The time that it takes for love to effect a person
So deep, so deep
So deep
You might also like[Outro]
Oh Sun, oh Sun
Oh Sun, oh Sun
Oh Sun, oh Sun
I see you happy
Oh Sun, oh Sun
