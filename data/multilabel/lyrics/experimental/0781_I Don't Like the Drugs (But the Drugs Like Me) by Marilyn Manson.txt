I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs

[Verse 1]
Norm life, baby
"We're white and oh so hetero
And our sex is missionary"
Norm life, baby
"We're quitters and we're sober
Our confessions will be televised"

[Pre-Chorus]
You and I are underdosed and we're ready to fall
We're raised to be stupid, taught to be nothing at all
We're taught to be nothing at all

[Chorus]
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs

[Verse 2]
Norm life, baby
"Our God is white and unforgiving
And we're piss tested and we're praying"
Norm life, baby
I'm just a sample of a soul
Made to look just like a human being
Norm life, baby
"We're rehabbed and we're ready
For our 15 minutes of shame"
Norm life, baby
"We're talkshown and we're pointing
Just like Christians at a suicide"

You and I are underdosed and we're ready to fall
We're raised to be stupid, taught to be nothing at all
We're taught to be nothing at all

[Chorus]
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs

[Bridge]
"There's a hole in our soul that we fill with dope
And we're feeling fine"
"There's a hole in our soul that we fill with dope
And we're feeling fine"
"There's a hole in our soul that we fill with dope
And we're feeling fine"

[Interlude]
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs

[Chorus]
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs (Drugs)
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs (Drugs)
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs (Drugs)
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs (Drugs)
[Outro]
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs
I don't like the drugs but the drugs like me
I don't like the drugs, the drugs, the drugs
