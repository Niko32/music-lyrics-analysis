I'm on

[Chorus]
Chopper vendetta, I'm on, fucked up the whole game
Leandoer shawty, got 'em drugs in the hallway
Stars on my face, I'm letting go of them old ways
Chopper vendetta, I'm blown, she want my whole brain

[Verse 1]
Fendi bags up on my back, I'm stackin' 'til the whole roof falls
Italian drug deals, 1K euro for my wine and snow
Standin' with my brothers on a roof, I think I see the storm
Walk up in the store with my boo, we like, "Gotta have it all"
Stars upon my neck, I'm sippin' bourbon
Dropped out of school 'cause I was workin'
When they see me, they all scream my surname (Leandoer)
Been living out a suitcase for the curren' (The currency)

[Chorus]
Chopper vendetta, I'm on, fucked up the whole game
Leandoer shawty, got 'em drugs in the hallway
Stars on my face, I'm letting go of them old ways
Chopper vendetta, I'm blown, she want my whole brain

[Verse 2]
They all wanna throw (They all wanna throw)
Shade on me 'cause I blow (Shade on me 'cause I blow)
They all wanna know (They all wanna know)
How I pull up in a Rolls (How I pull up in a Rolls)
I've been fallin' down and climbin' up
Sixty on a foreign truck
Y'all boys ain't workin', out of luck
Four-wheelers in a desert, yup
Truck foreign, hoe like a spider, up and then I crawl in
Riding 'round with studs on me, spikes on my Rembrandt carpet
Texas chainsaw on me, baby, frightening
Don't need no flash, all my jewelry lightning
And I'm stylin', champagne on an island
I'm just trying to fade away, burn up like titans
Lean
You might also like[Chorus]
Chopper vendetta, I'm on, fucked up the whole game
Leandoer shawty, got 'em drugs in the hallway
Stars on my face, I'm letting go of them old ways
Chopper vendetta, I'm blown, she want my whole brain
