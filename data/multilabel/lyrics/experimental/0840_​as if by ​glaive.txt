Why do I have to listen to you when you have zero to say?
Because I'm young? All my life I've been young
So I never get a turn

[Verse 1]
Hyperaggressive if I'm honest, I can't stand to be alone
My friends are so progressive, they called me "faggot," a year ago
And I couldn't cut them off because then I'd be on my own
Being obsessive sounds depressing but it's just the way it goes, just the way it goes

[Chorus]
And will that ever fucking change?
As if I'm, as if I'm ever gonna change
As if I'm, as if I'm ever gonna change
As if I'm, as if I'm ever gonna change
(As if I'm—, as if I'm—) Gonna change
(As if I'm—, as if I'm—) Gonna change
(As if I'm—, as if I'm—) Never gonna change

[Verse 2]
My friends on fentanyl, I hope they're finding their peace
On life support for a week, I heard they died in their sleep
There's so much truth in the fiction, don't know what to believe
There's so much money in addiction that I'm dying to need
Something more (Something more, something more)
I'm just dying to be something more, something more
You might also like[Chorus]
And will that ever fucking change?
As if I'm, as if I'm ever gonna change
As if I'm, as if I'm ever gonna change
As if I'm, as if I'm ever gonna change
(As if I'm—, as if I'm—) Gonna change
(As if I'm—, as if I'm—) Gonna change
(As if I'm—, as if I'm—)

[Bridge]
(As if I, as if I) I wonder if I'll ever get it right
(As if I, as if I) I wonder if I'll ever find the words
(As if I, as if I) I wonder if I'll ever be enough
(As if I, as if I) I wonder if I'll ever fuckin' change

[Chorus]
As if I'm, as if I'm ever gonna change (I'll stay the same)
As if I'm, as if I'm ever gonna change
As if I'm, as if I'm ever gonna change
(As if I'm—, as if I'm—) Gonna change
(As if I'm—, as if I'm—) Gonna change
(As if I'm—, as if I'm—) Never gonna change

[Outro: Timothée Chalamet]
Everybody talks to me like I'm the one, you know, I should change
Why should I change? I've never even gotten to find out who I am
And you want me to change, that's crazy
You tell me I'm bad before I even get to be anything
What the hell is that? Original sin or something?
It's you that wants the A before you even start
But when I say I want the same thing, I'm nuts, right?
I'm not going to cry
I'm going to find my place in this world, count on it
