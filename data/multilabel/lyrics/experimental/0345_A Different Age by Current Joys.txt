Oh, you don't know me, 'cause I'm from a different age
And you can't see me, 'cause I live in a different age
And you could hurt me, but you wouldn't know what to say
But you should believe me, our dreams are all the same
Like a life without love
God, that's just insane
But a love without life
Well, that just happens every day
And I wish I could change, but I'll probably just stay the same
And I wish you could sing along
But this song is a joke, and the melody I wrote, wrong

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Oh, you can't hear me 'cause I sing to a different age
And you should fear me 'cause I believe in a different age
But I live in the city that lives in a different age
Oh, I live in a city that lives in a different age
Where all the poets are writing memoirs
And I'm still singing songs
Oh, all the poets are writing memoirs
And I'm still singing songs
They say, "There's nothing left for you here, kid
Why don't you just go home?"
They say "This city is useless
Oh, we've already done it all"
Oh, all the poets are writing memoirs
And I'm still singing songs
And I wish you could sing along
But this song is a joke, and the melody I wrote, wrong!
