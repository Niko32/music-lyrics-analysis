I've named this one JPEG, because I like JPEGs, uh
For the resolution, the color, the size of them, everything about JPEGs I like
Check

[Verse 1: Danny Brown]
Narcissists, arsonists in my arsenal
Caught carpal tunnel 'cause I was holdin' it awkward
Got the crib like Hogwarts, I work my magic
Livin' like the early '80s and I got a sex habit
Habitual bridge burners sicker than Bob's Burgers
Nice with the shit since ridin' a bike on Chalmers
Was broken and washed, stealin' change for Arnold Palmers
AC broke, yayo truck was armored
Now everything I drive, it ain't got no gas
Late night nigga, inner city since Arctic Blast
Bitch body out of this world, she got a Martian ass
You always with them niggas, be the sausage fest
We all gonna land back to steal on a D.O.T.'s
I see why you a bad rapper
Get the fuck up out my face befo' I smack the ass backwards
When you're average at life, they can't get much better, rapper (Louder)
"Truth prevail," like the king of pop said
Ain't fuck with no Percs since they found Prince dead
Nigga, no cap
The bitch got bald heads and you think it's all wraps
'Til them niggas all dead, old head
I'm out for that hog head cheese (Style)
I'm a legend from Michigan like Mateen Cleaves
Rest in peace Eric Garner, 'cause I can't breathe
Smokin' loosey's on the same corner, used to serve fiends
You might also like[Interlude: JPEGMAFIA]
Servin' up a mojito
Okay, look

[Verse 2: JPEGMAFIA]
The black Konami cheat code
More Mitch than the Rico
The toast mint condition like serving up a mojito
Overworked so all of my talent backs up my ego
Up the score, off the rebound, and-one with the free throw
Oh, she want the nerve with her? Go figure
Posed too hard for the image, she cropped yo' ass out the picture
Gave me the leg up and that ain't even a kicker
Dropping SCARING THE HOES, end' up terrifying the nigge​r— wait
I got this down to a T, sharp as a crewcut, uh
Tables turn like Serato with death queued up
Y'all made a race, so I did the mechanic suit up
And I drive sum' crazy whenever the autotune's up
Put Tony on the mic like Pacino
Good fella with the lines, bangin' like De Niro, wait
Let's get this clear yo, the flows is a-blazin'
Don't slip, don't slack, now Rothstein in Casino

[Interlude: JPEGMAFIA]
Ayy, let me get that one back
Uh
[Outro: JPEGMAFIA]
Men lie, women lie, but the numbers don't
With no machines, so my numbers go where your numbers won't
Nasty

[Instrumental Outro]
