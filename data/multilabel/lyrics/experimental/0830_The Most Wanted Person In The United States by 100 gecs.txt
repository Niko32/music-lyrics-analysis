I turned on the news, and it said that I was
The number one most wanted person in the United States
The United States
The most wanted person in the United States
In the United States
The United States
The most wanted person in the United States
Woo!

[Verse 1: Laura Les]
Yeah, I'm a real killer
I just killed Bobby, and then I ate his dinner
Then I took his car, and I crashed it in the rivеr
Always been cold, I was born in the winter
Yeah, but hot likе the summer
Don't cry to me, I am not your mother
Everybody shuts the fuck up when I'm passing
You can see me on the fuckin' news, and I'm laughing
(Ha-ha-ha)
'Cause shit's so funny
I just killed your dad, and then I took his money
Queen of California, hot like the heat is
Got Anthony Kiedis sucking on my penis

[Bridge: Laura Les]
Oh, is it hot like that?
Yeah, it's hot like that
Is it hot like that?
Yeah, it's hot like that
Is it hot like that?
Yeah, it's hot like that
Is it hot like that?
Yeah, it's hot like that
(Haha)

[Verse 2: Dylan Brady]
I got the gun in the backseat
Ready to go, don't need to ask me
I got the gun in the backseat
Ready to go, don't need to ask me
Yeah, you better watch out, 'cause I'm a real killer
Never fall asleep without my finger on the trigger
I just killed Bobby and I threw him in the river
Did it all again, then I made myself some dinner
Oh, now I'm most wanted
Ten thousand dollars for my body in a coffin
Driving towards the sun, with my pedal on the metal
I can hear them coming up behind me, and they're yellin'
But they'll never catch me
Sleeping in a barrel in the bottom of the sea
Goddamn
It's a riot when I come up to the top
Got dogs tryna kill me while I'm pissin' in the pot
