Silent are my heart strings
Icy is my body heat, yeah
Lonely is my hoping
Empty is my sweet thing
Aching is my laughter
Busy is my pastor
Telling is my silence
Blurring my horizon
Tired of my resistance
Smothered is my distance, yeah
Careful are my footsteps
Possessive is my daybed

[Verse 2]
Vacant are my nightmares
Rest becomes my nowhere, yeah
Twenty is my vision
Only when I listen
Lower is my ceiling
Pressing are my feelings
Active are my fingers
Faux my cunnilingus
Dirty are my dishes
Many are my wishes
Fearless are my cacti
Friendly are the fruit flies
Jaded is my father
Childlike is my answer

Careful are my footsteps
Possessive is my daybed
Jaded is my father
Childlike is my answer (Like a child)
Careful are my footsteps
Possessive is my daybed
Baby are my footsteps
Possessive is my daybed
Baby are my footsteps
Possessive is my daybed
