Did you just what? Is what you yes?
Did you whatever, whatever you I guess?
The stalking horse was hides the guy
And which the pony is a phony was a lie

[Verse]
You say, stuff is way
Way to go, go away
Who had you was? I yes, you would
It was catastro, catastro-feeling good
As it the drag that has you are
Is in the bag that you drag behind your car

[Chorus]
Did you just what? Is what you yes?
Did you whatever, whatever you I guess?
The stalking horse was hides the guy
And which the pony is a phony was a lie

[Verse]
You say, stuff is way (Is what you say, is stuff is way)
Way to go, go away (So way to go, so go away)
Who had you was? I yes, you would (Who had you was? I yes, you would)
It was catastro, catastro-feeling good (It was catastro, catastro-feeling good)
As it the drag that has you are (As it the drag that has you are)
Is in the bag  that you drag behind your car (Is in the bag that you drag behind your car)You might also like
