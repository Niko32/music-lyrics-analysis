Where are we?
What the hell is going on?
The dust has only just begun to fall
Crop circles in the carpet
Sinking, feeling
Spin me 'round again and rub my eyes
This can't be happening
When busy streets a mess with people
Would stop to hold their heads heavy

[Chorus]
Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines
All those years
They were here first

[Verse 2]
Oily marks appear on walls
Where pleasure moments hung before
The takeover, the sweeping insensitivity of this
Still life

[Chorus]
Hide and seek
Trains and sewing machines
Oh, you won't catch me around here
Blood and tears (Hearts)
They were here first
You might also like[Bridge]
Mm, whatcha say?
Oh, that you only meant well?
Well, of course, you did
Mm, whatcha say?
Mm, that it's all for the best?
Of course, it is
Mm, whatcha say?
Oh, that it's just what we need, and you decided this?
Whatcha say?
Oh, what did she say?

[Outro]
Ransom notes keep fallin' out your mouth
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs (Paper word cut-outs)
Speak no feeling, no, I don't believe you
You don't care a bit, you don't care a bit
Ransom notes keep fallin' out your mouth
(Hide and seek)
Mid-sweet talk, newspaper word cut-outs
Speak, no feeling, no, I don't believe you
(Hide and seek)
You don't care a bit, you don't care a, you don't care a bit
(Hide and seek)
You don't care a bit, you don't care a bit
(Hide and seek)
You don't care a bit, you don't care a bit, you don't care a bit
