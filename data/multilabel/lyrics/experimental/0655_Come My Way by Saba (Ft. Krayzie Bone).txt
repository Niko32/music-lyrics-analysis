Yeah, daydreaming thinkin' how to get some money
And then we good, and then we good, and then we'll be good
All I'm doin' thinkin' how to get some money
And then we good, and then we good, and then we'll be good
Daydreaming thinkin' how to get some money
And then we good, and then we good, and then we'll be good
All I'm doin' thinkin' how to get some money
And then we good, and then we good, and then we'll bе good (Uh, yeah)

[Verse 1: Saba]
This sound like tube socks on Madison Avе
Students actin' bad up in the class
Drop out, but family'll ask
Lie like you plan on going back
Ayy, we ain't got no time to relax
Work the only priority intact
Posted on the porch shootin' the shit
Had to run them niggas shootin' shit
I wish that the guys had shields
Stoplights, cleaning windshields
Fiends will do it free for a feel
Had the same friends since I was little
Used to hoop with Poppy and Jaleel
Spooky bent the block and dropped a tape
Talked to Walt and watched him fly away
Multiply my problems by the day
West Side chillin' with a faithful
Knock it out the park, it's like the base loaded
I'ma get it booming like I'm Metro
Me, I'm getting to it how I'm meant to
Blood, I mean a vessel
I'ma tell him to be careful 'cause a copper wanna kill him
And the family in the ghetto
From the bottom of the barrel, I'ma run it like a pharaoh
Nigga, this is for the peasants who be worried bout the peso

Yeah, daydreaming thinkin' how to get some money
And then we good, and then we good, and then we'll be good
All I'm doin' thinkin' how to get some money
And then we good, and then we good, and then we'll be good
Daydreaming thinkin' how to get some money
And then we good, and then we good, and then we'll be good
All I'm doin' thinkin' how to get some money
And then we good, and then we good, and then we'll be good

[Verse 2: Krayzie Bone]
Kray type love grindin' hard, so really, I'll be fine
Shinin', ballin' 'til the end of my time
Stuck in my prime, I'm always at my best
Sick in the mind, go all day, never rest
Keep 'em in line, the flow got 'em in check
Me and mine, you niggas gotta respect
Leisure time, for me, that don't exist
I seek to find my peace, so a nigga drift sometime
Never no worry from me 'cause I'm knowin' that I'm truly blessed
Caution my steps
If I see majority go to the right, I walk to the left, ayy
Truly innovative, even niggas that be hatin', they be motivated
'Cause I'm so creative, motivator
And the suckers, we could never relate to
Trust no faker, shakin' these snakes
Ain't no haters making me wait
All I gotta say is they gon' see me shine (See me shine)
They gon' have to bottle Kray
Ooh, don't come around my way
Bone did it in, yep, we go overtime (Overtime)
[Chorus: Saba]
Yeah, daydreaming thinkin' how to get some money
And then we good, and then we good, and then we'll be good
All I'm doin' thinkin' how to get some money
And then we good, and then we good, and then we'll be good
Daydreaming thinkin' how to get some money
And then we good, and then we good, and then we'll be good
All I'm doin' thinkin' how to get some money
And then we good, and then we good, and then we'll be good
