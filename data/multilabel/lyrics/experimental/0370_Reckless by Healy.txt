Beach Boys on the ride home
I can get there with my eyes closed
Exactly 34 minutes after I pull out your driveway
You dial my phone
Paper cover rock
Scripture cover Peter (Cover Peter, yeah)
Yeah I'm cutting off my locks (Off my locks)
And I'm changing my demeanor (No, no)

[Interlude]
It goes like this

[Chorus]
Pool days, high tops
With my blue face, ice pops (Ooh-na-na)
I'ma make a shoelace necklace
Yeah we whipping pop's old Lexus (Yeah)
And I'm skipping school days, mic drops (Oh no)
Eyes on summer like cyclops
Yeah we fallin' off the sidewalk
Mama wants you home before nightfall

[Verse 2]
Summer come and I ain't got a new car
Yeah I'm still getting scooped up
Call me by my first letter, "Ayy E, what's up?"
Every now and then, city need a refresher
Breaking up to Sufjan
Wake up on your futon
Why you in my crewneck, wait (I really like that shirt)
Jerry's line too long
Teenage mutant
Coming out of my shell, ayy

Uh

[Verse 3]
Yeah this be that cornerpiece, cornerstone
10 piece, Corner sto'
Skinned knees, cortisone
And ex links, chromosome
Summer feet, cobblestone
Momma leave, home alone
On my feet, Chuckie T's
On my sleeve, Coraz√≥n
'99 titans
Close to my goals, yeah
Look like Kevin Dyson when my curfew getting closer
Hand me downs, pick me ups
Dark side, shouts Ryan
In my hood, call it buck

[Chorus]
Pool days, high tops
With my blue face, ice pops (Ooh-na-na)
I'ma make a shoelace necklace
Yeah we whipping pop's old Lexus (Ooh-na-na)
And I'm skipping school days, mic drops
Eyes on summer like cyclops
Yeah we fallin' off the sidewalk (Na-na-na-na)
Momma wants you home before nightfall (Na-na-na-na)
(Bounce)
Pool days, high tops
With my blue face, ice pops (Ooh-nah-nah)
I'ma make a shoelace necklace
Yeah we whipping pop's old Lexus
And I'm skipping school days, mic drops
Eyes on summer like cyclops
Yeah we fallin' off the sidewalk
Momma wants you home before nightfall (Ooh-na-na-na-na)
(Na-na)
[Interlude]
Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na

[Outro]
You can't stand me, you legless
Might grow my hair long like Legolas
Yeah I'm feeling ruthless, reckless
