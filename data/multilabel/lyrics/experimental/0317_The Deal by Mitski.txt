There's a deal you can make on a midnight walk alone
Look around, listen close, hear it fall from above
It will ask what you'd give and what you'd take for it in return
I once went on such a walk and I found that I'd said

[Chorus]
I want someone to take this soul
I can't bear to keep it, I'd give it just to give
And all I will take are the consequences
Will somebody take this soul?

[Verse 2]
Then, of course, nothing replied, nothing speaks to you in the night
And I walked my way home, there was no one in sight
Save a bird perched upon a streetlight, watchin' mе
So, I stopped and let it watch 'til I found that it said

[Bridge]
Now I'm taken, thе night has me
You won't hear me singin', you're a cage without me
Your pain is eased but you'll never be free
For now I'm taken, the night has me
[Outro]
There's a deal that I made
There's a deal that I made
There's a deal that I made
There's a dealYou might also like
