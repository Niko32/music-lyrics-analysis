(Ah, ah)

[Verse]
I wanted to die
There ain't no questioning, why haven't I?
Figured a way to destroy my life
I never wanted a pain so bad
Living with memories that I once had
Joining the voices of ones we once had
Running around in a realm made of glass
Into unknown territory of mass
And I look out of the window
Same sunset forever
Forever, ah
Eh, eh, eh-eh-hehYou might also like
