[Philosophical Passage - Throughout song]
“Lets suppose that you were able every night to dream any dream you wanted to dream
And you would naturally as you began on this adventure of dreams, you would fulfill all your wishes

You would have every kind of pleasure, you see
And after several nights you would say, "well that was pretty great."
But now lets have a surprise, lets have a dream which isn’t under control
Well something is going to happen to me that i don’t know what it’s gonna be
Then you would get more and more adventurous, and you would make further and further out gambles as to what you would dream, and finally you would dream where you are now

If you awaken from this illusion
And you understand that black implies white
Self implies other
Life implies death
You can feel yourself, not as a stranger in the world
Not as something here on probation, not as something that has arrived here by fluke, but you can begin to feel your own existence as absolutely fundamental

What you are basically, deep, deep down, far, far in, is simply the fabric and structure of existence itself.” (–Alan Watts)You might also like
