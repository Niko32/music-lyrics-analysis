Love, I don't know what makes you move
I don't know what makes you move in these photographs
Love, I stare at these polaroids
I stare at these polaroids and you're staring back

[Pre-Chorus]
Deep sleep aviations, in conversations with constellations
Midnight trepidations, the detonations of self-deprecation
Oo-oo-ooh, I don't need you anymore
Oo-oo-ooh, I don't need you anymore

[Chorus]
But love, when I close my eyes
I'm lying next to you
And I don't want memories
To fade like pictures do
In these picture frames

[Verse 2]
Love, I don't know what makes you laugh
I don't know what makes you laugh in these sepia tones
Love, I can't help but make believe
I can't help but make believe that you're coming home

[Pre-Chorus]
White noise meditation, the hesitation to change the station
Radio resuscitation, the suffocation in contemplation
Oo-oo-ooh, I don't need you anymore
Oo-oo-ooh,I don't need you anymore
You might also like[Chorus]
But love, when I close my eyes
I'm lying next to you
And I don't want memories
To fade like pictures do
Someone I once knew
In these picture frames
