Pop, pop this, he-e-e
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pack on me-e-e (Give me that)

[Verse 1: glaive]
I'm not even jokin' when I say that I don't need her
At least I got a fuckin' woman, got a Glock if you wan' meet up
I'm with kurtains, I'm with Wido, in the back, we got a heater
I'm with pposture, I'm with p4rkr, I ain't talkin' 'bout no Peter
I don't like the confrontation
I'm a fan of conversations
Talk your shit, bro, I ain't breaking
Look at me, my drink, she laced it

[Verse 2: Wido]
Racks in my wallet, can't fold
Yeah, I'm off the horse then I start to lose control
Yeah, he talkin' shit, so we wipin' his nose
She got inside me, jump out of the fourth floor
'Bout to take my life, I'm going real low
Silver chain on me, so heavy, move slow
Three weapons on me, in my heart, oh, no
Weapon on me, hit my heart, oh, no-no

I-I-I got a game we could play, Russian Roulette
I'm ending lives, ain't No Russian, now his crew's dead
Yeah, these pills, they got me tired
Call up Wido, I'm taking back cover fire (John)
Ayy, who's that coming? D.O.A
What you do? Run away
Need pa-pack, ándale
Think I'm scared? No way
I'm sending bullets, both ways
Shut the fuck up and protect me
Tried to break inside of hell, but my angels wouldn't let me
I got one gold bullet if you try to fucking tempt me
Got a couple people in my state, I know they tryna end me
I cannot be friendly
Get them racks and plenty
Don't get happy endin'
You're stuck on pretending, yeah

[Chorus: kurtains]
Ching that cunt
Got a spinna to his throat
Ha-ha-had to use a bullet, bet he crying on the floor
Pop, pop this, he-e-e
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pack on me-e-e
Ching that cunt
Got a spinna to his throat
Ha-ha-had to use a bullet, bet he crying on the floor
Pop, pop this, he-e-e
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pack on me-e-e
(Oh, oh, oh)
[Verse 4: ONE YEAR]
I've been goin' stupid, goin' mental
Lil' boy said you in the friend zone
Shi-Shiny teeth fitted in my dental
Fuck a studio, record in my bedroom
Feel like kketamine by the way I've been racin'
Don't hit my DM if you don't got payment
I don't like to wait, yeah, I'm so impatient
I'ma need a facelift, Dior on my fragrance

[Verse 5: angelus]
Hold up, y-y-you just want a piece of me
Thirteen rounds in this Glizzy, I ain't talking 'bout Felicity (Sheesh!)
Talking shit all the time, lil' bro, you can't be friends with me
I've been up for a minute with the gang, it's so clear to see
I don't care 'bout your feelings, bro, I just want my commas
Everybody movin' mad fun, I don't care about the drama
I got hoes on my DM's, I ain't talking 'bout Mo Bamba
All black on my fit, yeah, bro, that's my favourite colour

[Verse 6: kuru]
Fuck this, I ain't dealin' with your bullshit
Know you're actin' goofy, so I'm emptying a full clip
On your head, I wish that I was dead
And I don't wanna speak at all
I don't like to talk unless it's in my favour
Trying somethin' new, I ain't fuckin' with the flavour
Yeah, you're goin' out sad, please don't try to chase her
And I'm posted in a cell, I don't care 'bout good behaviour
[Verse 7: kurtains]
Eyes on you, you got eyes on me
Shoutout quinn, SS03
With Olly, I'm with Kwuzi
Rolling off your body (Hee, hee, hee, huh?)
Bitch, I'm laughing 'cause you funny
Bitch-made bitch, you're a bitch
Talkin' shit, bitch ass bitch
And nothing else coming out your mouth
But a Glick and a dick (Shut up)
You ain't talking when I ching that cunt

[Chorus: kurtains]
Got a spinna to his throat
Ha-ha-had to use a bullet, bet he crying on the floor
Pop, pop this, he-e-e
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pack on me-e-e
Ching that cunt
Got a spinna to his throat
Ha-ha-had to use a bullet, bet he crying on the floor
Pop, pop this, he-e-e
Pa-pa-pa-pa-pack on me-e-e

[Outro]
Uh, uh
