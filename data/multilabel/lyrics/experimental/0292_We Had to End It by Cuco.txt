Me and my lover came to an end
I didn't want that
But I guess she did


Sleepless nights have only begun
Swear I thought she was the one
The girl of my dreams


All my nightmares came to ruin my life
Mercy had no time
And time had no mercy on me
I felt so dumb thinking one day you could be my wife
Never thought you would lie
When you said you loved me
Nothing can bring me back to life
After you left me to die
On a road far away

You might also likeLove and lies shine so bright
'Cause they both made me blind
And I crashed as I looked away


Ghost of my past haunts my present
As there he welcomed
My agony and pain


He said I'll be gone before you know
Just finish this song
And you'll be where you belong
