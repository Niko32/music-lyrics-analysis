What you want me for?
What you want me for?
What you want me for?
What you waiting for then?
What you want me for?
What you want me for?
What you want me for?
What you waiting for then?

[Bridge]
Yeah, I don't know how you do what you do
But damn
Yeah, I don't know how you do what you do
But damn

[Verse]
Sweeter than a sycamore tree
He was buzzing, buzzing just like a bee for it
He said he never met a girl who make it euphoric
He said he never met a girl like me
And no, I don't think you're lying
I see it in your eyes
You wanna compromise

[Chorus]
What you want me for?
What you want me for?
(Tell me what you want)
What you want me for?
What you waiting for then?
(Tell me what you want)
What you want me for?
What you want me for?
(Tell me what you want)
What you want me for?
What you waiting for then?You might also like
