I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away)
From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way)
Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain)
I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame)
Where will I end up? (Uh, uh, uh)

[Post-Chorus]
If I don't wake up tomorrow
I let the pain do me in

[Verse]
Wake him in the middle of the night, to find I'm all alone
Oh no, where did he go? Where did he go? (Sometimes I think I'll never know)
Speaking all the pain and all the things that made us hate him
"What an ego" (I guess I'm better off than I know)

[Bridge]
Not good enough, not good enough
Not good enough, not good eno-
(You're afraid, you're afraid, you're afraid)
(You're afraid, you're afraid, you're afraid)

[Chorus]
I don't know where to begin, I think I'm (Moments away)
From everything crumbling all around me, so (Show me the way)
Out of the deep end, now my back is (Bowing in pain)
I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' the gun, I might be jumpin' (Oh no, the shame)
Where will I end up? (Uh, uh, uh)

(Don't let the pain do you in)
