Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo, yo
Ayy, yo, yo, ayy, ayy, ayy
I got loyal, uh, but I need more, ayy
Yo, yo, yo, uh, ayy, ayy

[Chorus]
Yuh, ayy, I got loyal hoes, but I need more, uh
This feel more like a truck, uh, it speed, but it still run, uh
I miss that ho and I hate it, yeah, 180 on Lake Shore, uh
I can’t go back home, uh, I can’t do what I want, uh

[Verse]
Saw got it tatted, we Dash, uh, ain’t nothing else I know, uh
Can’t do see through whips, uh, niggas want me out my glo, uh
Bitch must want me dead, uh, told her I can’t live without her, uh
Perc 30 slurrin’ my speech, uh, I’m itchin’, it got me poutin’, uh
Love her ‘cause she never doubt me, uh, LA but it’s still cloudy, yuh
Can’t wait to go back home, uh, sick of bein’ ‘round out-of-towners, uh
Still mix flats with the downers, uh, sneaky hoes can’t come around us, uh
I been gettin’ high all along, ayy, Perc 30 straight to my bones, ayy

[Chorus]
Yuh, I got loyal hoes, but I need more, uh
This feel more like a truck, uh, it speed, but it still run, uh
I miss that ho and I hate it, yeah, 180 down Lake Shore, uh
I can’t go back home, uh, ayy, ayy, yo
Ayy, ayy, I got loyal hoes, but I need more, uh
This feel more like a, uh, it speed, but it still run
I miss that ho and I hate it, uh, uh, ayy
I can’t go back home, niggas want me out my glo, ayyYou might also like
