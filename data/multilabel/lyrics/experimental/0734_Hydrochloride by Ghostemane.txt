You've taken all my pain away and gave me shiny chains
You've taken all my doubts away, replaced it with this shame
You took away all my problems, yeah, you bet
And then you gave me a brand new set

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm not afraid

[Chorus]
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore

[Verse 2]
I thought I would ride the high so high until I can't be reached by gravity, you won't catch me, won't catch me, everyone except me
But I soon realized the rules apply to me, I'm sorely mistaken, aching now, takin' out all my rage

[Pre-Chorus]
And now I'm not afraid

[Chorus]
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore
I don't love you anymore (I don't love you anymore)
I don't love you anymore (I don't love you anymore)You might also like
