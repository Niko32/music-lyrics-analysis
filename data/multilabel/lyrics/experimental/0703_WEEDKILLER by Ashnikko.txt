Twiddlin' my thumbs, yeah, I've been patient
Lobotomize a bitch, yeah, their eyes vacant
There's nowhere to run in the simulation
I'm havin' fun, it's a celebration
Ah, ah, detonation
Peace, love, meditation
Take drugs, eyes dilatin'
I go Liam Neeson in the movie Taken, ah

[Pre-Chorus]
I've been iced in hibernation
My roots in the pavement
No stimulation, I'm gonna photosynthesize

[Chorus]
We always knew it would come to this
That I would be the one to eliminate you
Weedkillеr, runnin' with scissors
I made knives out of broken ribs
I will bе the one to eliminate you
Weedkiller, weedkiller

[Verse 2]
Wait, oh
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Junkyard, put you in a car crusher
Trump card, bitch, I'm a ball buster
Predator goin' for the jugular
Rip it out, tie it in a knot, yeah, yeah
Pray to God, say goodbye
Make amends 'cause it's time
Metal death with my scythe
Titanium spine
I ignite
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
I've been iced in hibernation
My roots in the pavement
No stimulation, I'm gonna photosynthesize

[Chorus]
We always knew it would come to this
That I would be the one to eliminate you
Weedkiller, running with scissors
I made knives out of broken ribs
I will be the one to eliminate you
Weedkiller, weedkiller

[Outro]
Photosynthesize, you're no friend of mine
Cryo-freeze and crystalize, woah
Cut the power lines, flora fantasize
Little weedkiller, now the lawn is mowed
I've been training for murder
I've been training for murder
(Weedkiller, weedkiller)
