Stay afloat
When it feels like it's all going nowhere
And you want it all
But the tide keeps trying to pull you under
Let it go
You can't fight the waves, boy, it's no wonder
If you wanna grow
Don't fight what's natural (it's only natural)

[Pre-Chorus]
La-la-la-da-da-di-da-da-dow
(Lose it to the rush, lose it to the rush)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-la-da-di-da-di-dow
(Lose it to the rush, lose it to the rush)

[Chorus]
Let it rush all over, let it rush
(Lose it to the rush)
Let it rush all over, let it rush
(Lose it to the rush, lose it to the rush)

[Verse 2]
Why do I do the things I do?
(Oh, oh, if you only knew)
¿Querías salvarte? Dímelo
(Papi, siento que es tan natural)
They've got so much to say (to say)
And I don't find that strange (that strange)
I'd never make you change
I'd never do that to you

'Cause time stops still
Feels like it's all going nowhere
Time's not real
And when it's drifting away
'Cause the time stops still
Feels like we're all going under
The tide's not real
And we're just drifting in space

[Pre-Chorus]
La-la-la-da-da-di-da-da-dow
(Lose it to the rush, lose it to the rush)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-la-da-di-da-di-dow
(Lose it to the rush, lose it to the rush)

[Chorus]
Let it rush all over, let it rush
(Lose it to the rush)
Let it rush all over, let it rush
(Lose it to the rush, lose it to the rush)

[Outro]
(Scatting)
