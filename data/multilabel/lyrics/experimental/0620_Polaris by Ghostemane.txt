Pardon my soul (Pardon my soul)
Welcome to the end of the rope
Here I am alone, wrote a note? No
Going back, I am the one to atone
Throw them motherfuckers off the lifeboat
Water fill their lungs 'til they won't float
Sink to the floor till you can't sink no more (Sink to the floor)
God left me on read
What is so wrong with me that I can't get him to tell me the way?
Fuck faith like I'm Biggie Smalls 'til her walls get swole, I'm an animal, a hand up on her mandible
Fuck faith, fuck faith, fuck faith, fuck!
I'ma pave my own way, then I'll never give a bit of credit to a deity, or nobody but me

[Chorus]
(I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking)
I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking
I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking about
I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking
I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking about
I want you to hate me, I want you to hate me
I want you to hate me half as much as I hate myself
I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking
I know what you're thinking, I know what you're thinking about

[Bridge]
Hexada, never let up, I'ma get up
Never give up, I'ma make elixir out of shit, I'm
Hexed and I'll, never let up, I'ma get up
Never give up, I'ma make elixir out of shit
Hexada, never let up, I'ma get up
(Fuck faith, fuck faith)
Never give up, I'ma make elixir out of shit I'm
(Fuck faith, fuck faith)
Hexed and I'll, never let up, I'ma get up
(Fuck faith, fuck faith)
Never give up, I'ma...
(Fuck faith...)
