What did you say you'd find
Then come, come, come, get the hell inside
You can close your eyes
Well, you might as well commit suicide
Wait for me 'cause I waited for you
No, that's not what you should do
Don't hate me 'cause I don't hate you

[Chorus]
Insane eyes
You made me realize

[Verse 2]
Something in you died
Well, no, no, no, no fault of mine
Something in you died
Well, no, no, no, no fault of mine
Make the hell out of what you can see
Maybe then you'll not hang beside me
Don't ask me 'cause I cannot see

[Chorus]
Insane eyes
You made me realize

What did you say you'd find
Then come, come, come, get the hell inside

Well, you might as well commit suicide
Wait for me 'cause I waited for you
No, that's not what you should do
Don't hate me 'cause I don't know you

[Chorus]
Insane eyes
You made me realize
