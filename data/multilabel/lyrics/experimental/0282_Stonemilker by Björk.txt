[Verse 1]
Moments of clarity are so rare
I better document this
At last the view is fierce
All that matters is

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, who is open chested and
Who has coagulated
Who can share and
Who has shut down the chances?

[Chorus 1]
Show me emotional respect, oh, respect, oh, respect
And I have emotional needs, oh, needs, oh, ooh
I wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, oh, ooh

[Verse 2]
What is it that I have
That makes me feel your pain?
Like milking a stone
To get you to say it
You might also like[Pre-Chorus 2]
Who is open?
And who has shut up
And if one feels closed
How does one stay open?

[Chorus 2]
We have emotional needs, oh, needs, oh, needs, oh, ooh
I wish to synchronize our feelings, our feelings, oh, ooh
Oh, show some emotional respect, oh, respect, oh, ooh

[Outro]
