If I walk out the door, it starts our last goodbye
If you don't pull me back, it wakes a thousand eyes
If I walk out the door, it starts our last goodbye
If you don't pull me back, it wakes a thousand eyes
If I walk out the door, it starts our last goodbye
If you don't pull me back, it wakes a thousand eyes
If I walk out the door
If I walk out the door (A thousand eyes)
If I walk out the door (A thousand eyes)
If I walk out the door (A thousand eyes)

[Interlude]
Out the door, it starts
Out the door, it starts
Out the door, it starts
Out the door, it starts
Out the door, it starts
Out the door, it starts
Out the door, it starts
Out the door, it starts

[Verse 2]
It's gonna be cold with all those
It's gonna be cold with all those eyes
It's gonna be cold without those
It's gonna be cold with all those eyes
I'm so cold with all those
I'm so cold with all those eyes
I gotta be cold with all those
I'm so cold with all those eyes
It's gonna be cold with all those
