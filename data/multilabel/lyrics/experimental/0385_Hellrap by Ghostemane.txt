I just wanna kill somethin'

[Chorus]
Ottawa, Prague, Warszawa, Thessaloniki, chinga la policía, caught up in Madrid
I'm a genre-hopper, and I'm vicious like Sid, I'm a genre-hopper, and I'm vicious like Sid, yeah
Ottawa, Prague, Warszawa, Thessaloniki, chinga la policía, caught up in Madrid
I'm a genre-hopper, and I'm vicious like Sid, I'm a genre-hopper, and I'm vicious like Sid, yeah

[Verse]
Yeah, fuck an opponent, overground and I own it, I don't give a motherfuck about underground credit
Genre-fluid and I'm the best to do it, look at all the frauds tryna copy, can't do it
I don't wanna ride a wave but I made a wave, cultivate a cult, look at me 'cause I'm a freak
Black and white mane with a face full of makeup, prettier than your girl, nails sharp like a razor
Motherfuckers think it's all glam, fans think I'm the man, but really, I'm just a sad band member with bands
But it don't matter so matter of fact, I'mma empty my bladder all over the track and imagine me disappearing without a tear
And I ain't seen my bed since the end of Feb', I ain't seen my mama since then, kinda' make me wanna kill somethin'

[Refrain]
Yeah, I just wanna kill somethin'
Yeah, I just wanna kill somethin'
Sometimes I just wanna kill somethin'
Yeah, I just wanna kill somethin'

[Chorus]
Ottawa, Prague, Warszawa, Thessaloniki, chinga la policía, caught up in Madrid
I'm a genre-hopper, and I'm vicious like Sid, I'm a genre-hopper, and I'm vicious like Sid, yeah
Ottawa, Prague, Warszawa, Thessaloniki, chinga la policía, caught up in Madrid
I'm a genre-hopper, and I'm vicious like Sid, I'm a genre-hopper, and I'm vicious like Sid, yeah
