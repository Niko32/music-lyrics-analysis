Oh, the loneliest girl in town
Is bought for pennies a price
We dress her up in lovely gowns
She's easy on the eyes
Her soul is black and it's a fact
That her sneer will eat you alive
And the buyer always brings her back
Because all she does is cry

[Chorus]
So take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't give a damn
Ask for forgiveness, never permission
Take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't givе a damn
It's in the blood and this is tradition
Ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Oh, the loneliеst girl in town
Was bought for plenty a price
Well, they dress her up in golden crowns
His smile hides a lie
She smiles back, but it's a fact
That her fear will eat her alive
Well, she got the life that she wanted
But now all she does is cry
You might also like[Chorus]
Take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't give a damn
Ask for forgiveness, never permission
Take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't give a damn
It's in the blood and this is tradition

[Bridge]
You can't take it back, it's good as gone
Well, flesh amnesiac, this is your song
And I hope what's left will last all summer long
And they said that boys were boys, but they were wrong

[Chorus]
Take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't give a damn
Ask for forgiveness, never permission
Take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't give a damn
It's in the blood and this is tradition
Take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't give a damn
Ask for forgiveness, never permission
Take what you want, take what you can
Take what you please, don't give a damn
It's in the blood and this is tradition
[Outro]
(It's good as gone)
