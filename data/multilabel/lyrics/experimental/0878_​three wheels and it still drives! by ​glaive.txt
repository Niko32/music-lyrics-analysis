[Intro]
(Okay, one, two, three, four)

[Verse 1]
It was Valentine's and you were smilin' 'til I broke the news
You must've hated to hear the truth, that I was leaving
'Cause now you're raising your voice and you're hiding your face
Even if I had a choice, I don't think that I would stay, I would go
My mom told me this morning that your dad might be coming home

[Chorus]
Right person, wrong time
You best believe when I say it
I haven't felt this way in a long, long time
6 Dogs by the seaside, think of you when they play it
For a, for a long, long time, and that's alright
My friends all ask what's on my mind
And I can't lie, it's you sometimеs
So I just smile, think of you and I

[Verse 2]
How do we always end up right back hеre
In my bedroom with windows that aren't quite clear?
I know that you regret the things you said
I hope that you're a mess and I'm upset
Oh no, I can't help but hate the cold
I told my mom this morning that I'm never coming home
You might also like[Chorus]
Right person, wrong time
You best believe when I say it
I haven't felt this way in a long, long time
6 Dogs by the seaside, think of you when they play it
For a, for a long, long time, and that's alright
My friends all ask what's on my mind
And I can't lie, it's you sometimes
So I just smile, think of you and I

[Interlude]
And I, I, I, yeah, fuck

[Part II]

[Chorus]
Then you called me up and said you hated me
Although I'm not upset, I'd love to reconnect sometime
We could chit and chat 'bout this and that
I could fuck with your head like you fucked with mine
Call me up, wish you had dated me
Although I'm not surprised, I wish you didn't have to lie
We go tit for tat 'bout each other's past
You can tell me you hate me, baby, that's just fine

[Verse]
The Black Paintings are on the walls
From the last time you gave me a call
Took my last dime, I really gave you it all
We used to pass time, now we're just strangers, oh God
I hate this part more than I thought I would
It's far too hard, I think I should
Go back to bed, go back to bed, go back to bed
[Chorus]
Then you called me up and said you hated me
Although I'm not upset, I'd love to reconnect sometime
We could chit and chat 'bout this and that
I could fuck with your head like you fucked with mine
Call me up, wish you had dated me
Although I'm not surprised, I wish you didn't have to lie
We go tit for tat 'bout each other's past
You can tell me you hate me, baby, that's just fine
