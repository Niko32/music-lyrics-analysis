Ayy, can you tell Charlie come turn this light off out here?
Ayy, ayy, take the reverb off
No echo, no reverb
Alright, yeah, alright there we go

[Verse 1]
Ayy
I got propane in my APC's
I know all about my plug, he's a lowlife
I know all about my bitch, she's a lowlife
I know all about myself, I ain't one of them
Them cross the street when you see them boys, I run with them
Fucking finesse the ride bouncer, I ain't come with them, ayy
I am hovering Xanax and downing substances, ayy
Keep trying to stop, withdrawal driving through my stomach man
Been anti-public man
High while made Alternative Trap
On my brothers and
My heir tryna get my homie back up on this block again
Free Paris, if he stabbed you in the back, I carved the knife for him
Ayy, ayy man that's fucked up
Facing 'Woods, chasing stains, it's me, Javon and Sawbuck
Tell them how I love a new bitch like every five months
It's gang, gang, baby, do the same thing baby
I'm Curt Henning perfect, what you sayin' Plain Janey
Bitch I'm bossy, boy, I'm gang when I'm talking to you
Girl these drugs don't feel the same when I bought 'em for you
Her school all up in your ear
But you ain't gon' own me shit boo
Girl these drugs don't feel the same when I bought 'em for you
Oh you heard about my tactics
Well I got a new playbook
Vibrating the groupchat, hoping your ass stay shook
Fifty-six in they boof pack
I think my face go
Hit my peak already man, I think I'm just gon' stay home
You might also like[Chorus]
I might find myself stuck in my head
And I might find myself lying, saying, "It's alright"
And you might myself stuck in your head
Do whatever to get high I'm a low life
I'm a lowlife
I'm coolin' with some lowlifes
Man, man, man
Ayy, look

[Verse 2]
I might just go, gone and rob bank today
I might superman this bitch and Bape towel the cape
I have just gone by myself and made mistakes
And I'm a selfish guy, delete your Instagram bae
And I'm still out west, good out south when it matter
Wicker Park legends on rooftops off ladders
Pound sign bitch I'm that boy
All he got a quarter pound
Take them down my cheese royal
Pussy hunnid twelve ducking, real running
Nunu pack, skate man, looking Lauren London
And check your homie dawg he talking to his sleeve youth
Check your homie dawg he talking to his sleeve too

[Chorus]
I might find myself stuck in my head
And I might find myself lost and, "It's alright"
And you might myself stuck in your head
Do whatever to get high I'm a lowlife
Yup, I'm a lowlife
I'm blacked out with some lowlifes
Lowlife, ayy
