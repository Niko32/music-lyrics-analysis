Define her abyss
Show it respect
Then a celestial nest
Will grow above

[Pre-Chorus 1]
When I'm broken, I am whole
And when I'm whole, I'm broken

[Chorus]
Our mother's philosophy
It feels like quicksand
And if she sinks
I'm going down with her

[Verse 2]
Locate her black lake
The steam from this pit
Will form a cloud
For her to live on

[Pre-Chorus 2]
When she's broken, she is whole
And when she's whole, she's broken
You might also like[Chorus]
Our mother's philosophy
It feels like quicksand
And if she sinks
I'm going down with her

[Verse 3]
Hackle this darkness
Up to the light
Where choreographed oxygen
Embroiders the air

[Pre-Chorus 3]
When we're broken we are whole
And when we're whole we're broken

[Outro]
We are the siblings of the sun
Let's step into this beam
Every time you give up
You take away our future
And my continuity and my daughter's
And her daughters
And her daughters
And her daughters
