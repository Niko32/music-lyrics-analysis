Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon
Yeah, it's seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah

[Verse 1: Dylan Brady]
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon
I got problems with my spending
All these horses in my engine
Doing eighty in a thirty
But I'm never in a hurry
Screaming, "La-di-da-di-da-di
All I wanna do is party"
Drinkin' bottles of Moscato
Takin' pictures with a model
Stayin' up until the morning
Wish that I was more discerning
Goin' wild like coyote
Where's the water? Something's burnin', yeah
You might also like[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon
Yeah, it's seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah
[Verse 2: Laura Les]
Ah, blow out the blunt smoke
Sound of the shotgun
I wanted smoke so I went out and I got some
Live in dog years and I feel twenty-six
Yeah, I'm old bitch but I learn new tricks
Better learn quick or end up like green bricks
You say you smoke real trees, they look like little sticks
We don't smoke trees, we smoke tree sized dicks

[Chorus: Dylan Brady]
Seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon
Yeah, it's seven-fifty-seven
Yeah, I'll never go to heaven
I've been smokin' since eleven
Told the devil he's a lemon, yeah
[Outro: Laura Les]
I smell the trees when I'm in Colorado
Interior gas station McDonald's
I left my cell phone dead at the house
I see the stars when the sun goes down
Somebody's making money off of my problems
The way that you're talking, you'd better wear a condom
I smell cowards and sons of a bitch
Everything quick all smells like shit
I smell the trees when I'm in Colorado
Interior gas station McDonald's
I left my cell phone dead at the house
I see the stars when the sun goes down
