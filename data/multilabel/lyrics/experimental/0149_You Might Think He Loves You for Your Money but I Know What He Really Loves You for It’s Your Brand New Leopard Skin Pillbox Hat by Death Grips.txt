Get so fuckin' dark in here
Come-come fuck apart in here
I die in the process
You die in the process
Kettle drum roll hard shit
Fuck I said fucker don't start shit

[Hook]
Come-come fuck apart in here, I
Come-come fuck apart in here, I

[Verse 1]
I hover above you
Life pulled out your mouth
I become you
Opening of the mouth
Unlawful possession
Jellyfish in cold sweat deep end
Hollow shell twitch disconnection
Pupils swell
My entrance
Hijacked no questions asked
Stretch you on like latex mask
My sigil's your epitaph
You might also like[Hook]
Come-come fuck apart in here, I
Come-come fuck apart in here, I
Die

[Bridge]
I'm not you, I'm not you, I'm not you

[Verse 2]
Fear
You wear it well
Mademoiselle
Here's to your destiny
Hysterics scream help
Don't worry, in a few you'll all be somewhere else
Prepare yourselves
Freelance motherfucker

[Refrain 2]
Get so fuckin' dark in here
Come-come fuck apart in here
I die in the process
You die in the process
Kettle drum roll hard shit
Fuck I said fucker don't start shit
Emerald tablet apartment toxic
[Hook]
Come-come fuck apart in here, I
Come-come fuck apart in here, I
