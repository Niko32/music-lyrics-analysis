True essence of the D-9 enterprises, man
Key to the city, man
Uh, uh

[Verse 1]
Secrets, killing me
Prada boots from Italy
Everything changed for me
It changed for me
It could do for you what it did to me
Look what it did to me
They didn't care about me, now you're into me

[Chorus]
Ecco, he keeps the party on him, rolling I'm rollin', rollin', rollin'
Live and we die about this shit you know it
Been getting money? I want you to show it
I got the key to the city
Twitter at me, it's @Bladeecity
It is me, just admit it
One hundred fifty just to kick it
We got to keep the party going
2019 it's how I'm coming
Caught up, caught up in a bad moment, take it as a omen
Put a mask on my face, now I look like an emoji
Sign on the door, it says "Drain members only"

How could I be so greedy?
I put myself first when you needed me the most
You can fool me so easy
Put myself down when you needed me so low
Was it all for no reason?
I think about you, I think about us sometimes
Clean the street with the bleach, and
Take my shoes off, walk with you somehow

[Chorus]
Ecco, he keeps the party on him, rolling I'm rollin', rollin', rollin'
Live and we die about this shit you know it
Been getting money? I want you to show it
I got the key to the city
Twitter at me, it's @Bladeecity
It is me, just admit it
One hundred fifty just to kick it
We got to keep the party going
2019 it's how I'm coming
Caught up, caught up in a bad moment, take it as a omen
Put a mask on my face, now I look like an emoji
Sign on the door, it says "Drain members only"

[Outro]
The true essence, man
The source of the drain, man
The one and only
