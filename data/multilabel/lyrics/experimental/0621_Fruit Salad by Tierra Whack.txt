Worry ‘bout yourself and don’t worry about nobody
Drinking’ water, eatin’ fruits, takin' care of my body
When you doin’ good, they want kick it just like Karate
Stealin’ swag, I know they mad, they tried to rob me

[Chorus]
They tried to rob me, they can't deny me
You can't define me, don’t need no ID
They want to rob me, they can’t deny me
You can't define me, I don’t need no ID

[Bridge]
I did, I did, I did (I eat all my vegetables)
I did, I did, I did (Lower my cholesterol)
I did, I did, I did (That fast food just make you slow)
I did, I did, I did (Lower my cholesterol)
I did, I did, I did (I ate all my vegetables)
I did, I did, I did (I just had to let you know)

[Chorus]
They want to rob me, they can't deny me (I did, I did, I did)
(That fast food makes you slow)
You can't define me, I don't need no ID
