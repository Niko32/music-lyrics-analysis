I'm in too deep, I know
In too deep, I know
In too deep, I know

[Chorus: Bladee]
I love to play the victim, I love to play the victim
I love to play the victim, I love to pass the blame
I love to play the victim, I love to play the victim
I love to play the victim, I love to pass the blame

[Verse 1: Ecco2k]
I made a promise not to eat forbidden fruits
Some like it sour, I want you to be my grapefruit
Some like it sweet, don't do it, it's not good for you
I really know I shouldn't do it, but I've got to
I've got to stop it, I've got to get a grip (I can't stop)
I've got to stop it, I've got to get a grip (I can't stop)
I've got to stop it, I've got to get a grip (I can't stop)
I've got to stop it, I've got to get a grip
I made a promise to myself (Promise to myself)
I made a contract with myself (Never rest in the hands of somebody else)
(Contract with myself)
I walk around, leave no footsteps, left, right, left
(Never rest in the hands of somebody else)
(I walk around, leave no footsteps, left, right, left)

I don't really think about it (I don't really think about it)
I don't wanna try to hurt nobody (I don't wanna try to hurt nobody)
I don't want to hurt my own soul too (I don't want to hurt my own soul too)
I don't wanna try to hurt nobody
I don't want to hurt my own soul too

[Chorus: Bladee]
(I know)
I love to play the victim, I love to play the victim
I love to play the victim, I love to pass the blame
I love to play the victim, I love to play the victim
I love to play the victim, I love to pass the blame
