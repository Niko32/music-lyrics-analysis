[Verse 1]
Yeah, bitch, I'm here to take that crown
Make you move it up and down
Pull up, pull out the tangerine dreams
Step out of that limousine
We walk in, and we flossy
Your B keep it bink, and we bossy
Hey, it's like I told you, song number one

[Pre-Chorus]
Take the crown, shut it down, 'bout to steal the show
Shooting star, I'm a boss, Marilyn Monroe
All the girls 'round the world, now we in control
All the girls 'round the world, one, two, three, let's go
Take the crown, shut it down, 'bout to steal the show
Shooting star, I'm a boss, Marilyn Monroe
All the girls 'round the world, now we in control
All the girls 'round the world, one, two, three, let's go
