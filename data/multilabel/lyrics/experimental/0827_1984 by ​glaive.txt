She's in a red beret in a nice caf√©
The Versace shades hide the tears on her face (It's like)
1984, we had like everything we wanted and fucking more
There were so many avenues to fucking explore
And there's this one little detail that I can't ignore

[Chorus]
I wasn't lying when I said that you meant everything to me
But I guess everything means nothing when you're lying through your teeth
And all those nothings, they meant everything when you were next to me
And I ain't fronting that my new girl, she'll do anything for me
And I ain't lying when I said that you meant everything to me
But I guess everything means nothing when you're lying through your teeth
And all those nothings, they meant everything when you were next to me
And I ain't fronting that my new girl, she'll do anything for me

[Verse 2]
I'm asking myself, "Why? Why are you like this?"
I try and try and try, and you don't mind it
You never seem to like all of the kindness
You never were one for all of the crying
You're fucked up in the head, I woke up in your bed
And I know that's a problem 'cause of all that you said
Like I'm a prick, I'm a dick, "He didn't ever give a shit"
I'm an asshole, telling it, my life is a fucking trip
You might also like[Bridge]
We're both crazy, but one of us is good at hiding it
But for right now, I ain't fucking hiding shit
And I fell in love with the finer things
The food, wine, and drink

[Chorus]
I still wasn't lying when I said that you meant everything to me
But I guess everything means nothing when you're lying through your teeth
And all those nothings, they meant everything when you were next to me
And I ain't fronting that my new girl, she'll do anything for me
And I ain't lying when I said that you meant everything to me
But I guess everything means nothing when you're lying through your teeth
And all those nothings, they meant everything when you were next to me
And I ain't fronting that my new girl, she'll do anything for me
