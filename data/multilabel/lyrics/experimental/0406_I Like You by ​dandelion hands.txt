I am scared to say I miss you
Last time I had you I should have kissed you
These feelings fester up inside
But how could I deny these butterflies

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope I'm not stuck on your waiting list
Because I dream of you in colors that donâ€™t exist
And I think it's high time for you to know

[Chorus]
I like you, I like you, I like you
And I hope you like me too

[Verse 2]
You've been there through all I've been through
Kept me sane and held my hand too
The way you make me feel alright
So how could I deny your lips on mine?

[Pre-Chorus]
I hope I'm not stuck on your waiting list
Because I dream of you in colors that don't exist
And I think it's high time for you to know
You might also like[Chorus]
I like you, I like you, I like you
And I hope you like me too

[Verse 1]
I am scared to say I miss you
Last time I had you I should have kissed you
These feelings fester up inside
But how could I deny these butterflies
