Yesterday was a million years ago
In all my past lives I played an asshole
Now I found you, it's almost too late
And this earth seems obliviating
We are trembling in our crutches
High and dead, our skin is glass

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm so empty here without you
I crack my xerox hands

[Chorus]
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll never say goodbye

[Verse 2]
And the dogs slaughter each other softly
Love burns its casualties
We are damaged provider modules
Spill the seeds at our children's feet

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'm so empty here without you
I know they want me dead
You might also like[Chorus]
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll never say goodbye

[Bridge]
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll never say goodbye

[Chorus]
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll never say goodbye
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll be together while the planet dies
I know it's the last day on Earth
We'll never say goodbye

[Outro]
We'll never say goodbye
We'll never say goodbye
