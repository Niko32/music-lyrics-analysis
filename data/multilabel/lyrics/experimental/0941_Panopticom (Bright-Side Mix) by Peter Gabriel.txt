In the air the smoke cloud takes its form
All the phones take pictures while it's warm

[Chorus]
Panopticom, let’s find out what’s going on
Panopticom, let’s see where clues are leading
Panopticom, won't you show us what's going on?
Panopticom, show how much is real

[Bridge]
And we pour the medicine down
While we watch the world around us
We got witness on the ground
Takin' in the evidence
And we reach across the globe
Got all the information flowing
You face the motherload
Tentacles around you
Around you

[Verse 2]
From above and deep below the ground
It was in Berlin that all the evidence was found
Look from the street and we look down from the skies
See through the barriers, we can see through all those lies
You might also like[Chorus]
Panopticom, let’s find out what’s going on
Panopticom, let’s see where clues are leading
Panopticom, won't you show us what's going on?
Panopticom, show how much is real

[Bridge]
And we pour the medicine down
While we watch the world around us
We got witness on the ground
Takin' in the evidence
And we reach across the globe
Got all the information flowing
You face the motherload
Tentacles around you
Around you
Around you
Around you
Around you
