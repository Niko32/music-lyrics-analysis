Giddy up, giddy up
Giddy up
Giddy up, giddy up

[Verse 1]
Wanna move into a fool's gold room
With my pulse on the animal jewels
Of the rules that you choose to use to get loose
With the luminous moves
Bored of these limits, let me get, let me get it like—

[Chorus]
—wow!
It's like, right now
It's like, wow!
It's like, right—
—right now
It's like, wow!
It's like, right now
It's like, wow!
It's like, right now
Oh, wow!

[Verse 2]
It's my life, your life
Live it once, can't live it twice
So nice, so nice
Smooth like a tidal wave, take you on a getaway
My friends, your friends
Livin' every day like it's just about to end
Now we're pissing in the wind 'cause it's so pine fresh
Right now
Yeah I, I wanna get it like—
You might also like[Chorus]
—wow!
It's like, right now
It's like, wow!
It's like—
(Giddy up)
—wow!
It's like, right now
Wow!
Wow!
Oh, wow, it's like, right now

[Verse 3]
It's your life
Falling like a hot knife
Call your wife; secular times, these times
My demon's on the cell phone
To your demons, nothing's even right or wrong
It's irrelevant, elephant in the room goes, “Boom,”
Standing on the lawn doing jiujitsu
Girl in a bikini with the Lamborghini shih tzu

[Bridge]
It's your life
You gotta try to get it right
Look around, don't forget where you came from
It's just another perfect night
We're gonna take it around the world
(Wow!)
We're gonna take it around the world
(Wow!)
Ride these wild horses
(Wow!)
Ride these wild horses
(Wow!)
We're gonna take it around the world
[Outro: Beck + child]
Like—
(Wow—wow!)
Giddy up, giddy up
Like—
Giddy up!
Wow! What a beautiful day!
