Left, right, left, right
Get that all night
Get it right
Get it right
New chain, you changed
Here's your receipt
Get it right
Get it right

[Verse 1]
Hello Kitty why the long face?
You keep on standing, standing, standing in the same place
New coupons, riding in the Chevrolet with big bass
You're deep on talkin, talkin' 'bout how we all lack taste

[Refrain]
Beamer, Bentley
Make me, spend me
New chain, you changed
Here's your receipt

[Pre-Chorus]
Bring me down, tear me up
Take my very last buck
Go to class, kiss my ass
It'll bring you good luck
Brighten up, lighten up
What is it they're fighting for?
Slow it down, speed it up
Here's the cake they're biting for
You might also like[Hook]
I'm not gonna be yours right now
Cause I'll never be yours no how
I'm not gonna be yours right now
Cause I'll never be yours no how
Cause I'll never be yours...

[Verse 2]
Hello Kitty why the long face?
You keep on standing, standing, standing in the same place
New coupons riding in the Chevrolet with big bass
You're deep on talking, talking,'bout how we all lack taste

New chain, you changed

Cause I'll never be yours no how
I'm not gonna be yours right now
Cause I'll never be yours no how
Cause I'll never be yours...
