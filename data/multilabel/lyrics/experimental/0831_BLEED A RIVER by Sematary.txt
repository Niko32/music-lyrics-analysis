Real Haunted Mound
Yeah
You can be my haunted girl, if you like my haunted guys

[Chorus]
Baby, I would bleed a river, just to see your pretty face
Baby, you know I keep a heater, but it's just to keep you safe
Baby, I know you got the shivers, my fire strong today
Baby, I’ll bleed you forever, and bury you by the lake
Baby, I would bleed a river

[Verse]
Fuck the world, I'll stay forever
My fire go higher, shawty make my shadow smile
When she barf up on my dick, I know I love her
Baby, I'd die for you, I love you till the end and after too
You can be my haunted girl if you like my haunted guys
Baby, I need your skull, and your blood run down my knife
Put your bеd up on my grave so we can fuck for all time
Ridе up in my Cadillac, I wanna burn with you alive
Gimme some sugar, baby, take my blood
I sleep when I wanna, can you stay up?
Can I take your skin, hang it on my wall?
Skellingtons in our arms in the mud

Baby, I know you got the shivers, my fire strong today

Baby, I would bleed a river

[Bridge]
I will feed your blood to the river
I won't leave, no, no, no, never
I will feed your blood to the river
I won't leave, no, no, no, never
I will feed your blood to the river
I won't leave, no, no, no, never

[Chorus]
Baby, I would bleed a river, just to see your pretty face

Baby, I know you got the shivers, my fire strong today
Baby, I'll bleed you forever, and bury you by the lake
Baby, I would bleed a river
