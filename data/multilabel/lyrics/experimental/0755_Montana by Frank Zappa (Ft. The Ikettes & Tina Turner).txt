I might be movin' to Montana soon
Just to raise me up a crop of dental floss
Raisin' it up, waxin' it down
In a little white box that I can sell uptown
By myself, I wouldn't have no boss
But I'd be raisin' my lonely dental floss
Raisin' my lonely dental floss

[Verse 2]
Well I just might grow me some bees
But I'd leave the sweet stuff to somebody else
But then on the other hand I would
Keep the wax and melt it down
Pluck some floss and swish it around
I'd have me a crop, and it'd be on top
That's why I'm movin' to Montana

[Refrain]
Movin' to Montana soon gonna be a dental floss tycoon, yes I am
Movin' to Montana soon, gonna be a mennil-toss flykune

[Instrumental Break 1:53 - 3:22]
[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I'm pluckin' the ol' dental floss that's growin' on the prairie
Pluckin' the floss! I plucked all day an' all nite an' all afternoon
I'm ridin' a small tiny hoss, his name is Mighty Little
He's a good hoss, even though
He's a bit dinky to strap a big saddle or blanket on anyway
He's a bit dinky to strap a big saddle or blanket on anyway
Anyway
[Bridge]
I'm pluckin' the ol' dental floss
Even if you think it is a little silly, folks
I don't care if you think it's silly, folks
I don't care if you think it's silly, folks

[Verse 3]
I'm gonna find me a horse just about this big
An' ride him all along the border line
With a pair of heavy-duty zircon-encrusted tweezers in my hand
Every other wrangler would say I was mighty grand
By myself I wouldn't have no boss
But I'd be raisin' my lonely dental floss
Raisin' my lonely dental floss
Raisin' my lonely dental floss

[Verse 4]
Well I might ride along the border
With my tweezers gleamin' in the moon-lighty night
And then I'd get a cuppa coffee and give my foot a push
Just me and the pygmy pony over by the dental floss bush
And then I might just jump back on
And ride like a cowboy into the dawn to Montana
