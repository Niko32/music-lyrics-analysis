You like control, well, I do too
Take off my clothes and watch me move
You can come closer, I'll let you hurt me
How you choose

[Verse 2]
Help me with the zipper on my skirt, it's stuck
As you kneel, I'll be watching you fix me
This view of you, of the top of your head makes me forgive you

[Chorus 1]
But how long, how long can we play this way?
I'm tired, I'm tired of not loving you
My heart, my heart wants to hold you
But I know, I know, I know the rules

[Verse 3]
Blue light, dark room, the white of your teeth
As you smile at my trembling shoulders
But your skin, did you notice your skin?
It cries a soft weep like mine

[Chorus 2]
I'll sell, I'll sell my whole to you
What's my, what's my, what's my price?
How 'bout, how 'bout just a part of you?
'Cause I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I want, I wantYou might also like
