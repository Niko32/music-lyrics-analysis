They want a story, I'ma tell 'em that
They wanna see, I got the visions
Want the change, I'll make the difference
And you know that I'll be searching 'til I bring it back
Yeah I went through hell and back to find myself
But I am not the same as who had left, no
I am not the same, I'm reinvented from the head-toe
Still, I'm on that same old
Still, I'm grinding just to reach a payroll
Since I was like yea-tall and yea-old
I was always cooking, you were feeding off the day-olds
I ain't really know it but I should though
I ain't really get it but I could though
Something bout the distance got me shook though
Head so full of "I don't care"s and "I don't know"s
But I been hiding from that part of me, still keep it close
My tired face my normal face, yeah, you know that ain't change
I got a goal, I got a check so you know I can't stay
Yeah, you know I can't stay

[Chorus: khai dreams]
And I see the sun, it sets down on my tired city
Wind blowing on my face, I wonder if it's drifting
To somewhere far away, I'd like to come along and
I'd like to come along and, oh I'd like to come along and
I see the sun, it sets down on my tired city
Wind blowing on my face, I wonder if it's drifting
To somewhere far away, I'd like to come along and
I'd like to come along and, oh I'd like to come along and

Woke up right side of the bed
Still broke, still Joe, but it's all on my head
I got hope, got love, got a spot on the edge
I got goals, got flows and I'm tryin' to wed
I might
Go deep, hoping it'll be okay
I can't wait until I see the day
No sleep, hold dreams in pillowcases
Now we gon' see it's so amazing
No choice but I ain't say it controllin' me
Holds me down to the ground when I'm feelin' so over me
Get surrounded by sounds thinkin' this how it's supposed to be
I ain't feelin' as lonely and I ain't hip with the rosary but
I got hope got faith in this
I feel great, feel dope tryna take a risk
With my friends, know foes gonna hate on this
See nice colors every day, no shade in this

[Chorus: khai dreams]
And I see the sun, it sets down on my tired city
Wind blowing on my face, I wonder if it's drifting
To somewhere far away, I'd like to come along and
I'd like to come along and, oh I'd like to come along and
