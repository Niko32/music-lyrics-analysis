One, two, three, four
You're calling me crazy
And that’s one thing I've been feeling like lately
I made attempts just to save my soul
And I'm afraid I have to let you go

[Chorus]
I could just fantasize
You said I’m not your type
I don't wanna waste your time
I'm stuck in this state of mind
I could just fantasize
You said I'm not your type
I don't wanna waste your time
I'm stuck in this state of mind

[Verse]
I saw that you called last night (Night)
You're depressed, but you don't know why (Why)
Spent a whole damn night online (Online)
I check-in, but you say you’re fine (You’re fine)
Baby, what do you need? (What do you need?)
Escape all your problems, only so long to sleep (So long to sleep)
I read all about it
I like you, you doubt it
Claw to the surface, I'm drowning
My memory’s cloudy
You always gotta be right
Only care about yourself
You don't need nobody else
You picked me up inside your A5
And now you taking off my belt
Tried to hide the things that you felt
Tried to dodge the cracks but you fell
Whoa, whoa
You might also like[Bridge]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Chorus]
I could just fantasize
You said I'm not your type
I don't wanna waste your time
I’m stuck in this state of mind
I could just fantasize
You said I'm not your type
I don't wanna waste your time
I'm stuck in this state of mind

[Outro]
I don't wanna waste your time, yeah
I don't wanna waste your time
