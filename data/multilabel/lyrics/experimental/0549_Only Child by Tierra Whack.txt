Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah

[Refrain]
You ain't never think about nobody but yourself
Selfish
Man, I really can't wait until you gon' need my help
Helpless
You ain't never think about nobody but yourself
Selfish
Man, I really can't wait until you gon' need my help
Helpless
(Help me, please)

[Chorus]
You must be the only child because you're so stingy
I just wanna go buck wild when you don't defend me
I been on the fuckin' prowl, I been countin' Benjis
You done turned my heart so cold, I should work at Friendly's
(Ain't shit sweet)
Darlin', darlin', I've been prayin' for you, for you
(I been prayin' for ya, I been prayin' for ya) For you
(I been prayin', I been, I been, I been prayin' for you)
Darlin', darlin', I've been callin' on God for you (Hope that He pick up)
No, for you (Jesus Christ, pick up)
(I'm hopin' that he pick up)

It's not your fault, it's how you were raised
Excuses, excuses really all that you say
Not here to play, you can't seem to share
Every other day, you forget how to care
About me, about me
What about me? About me?
Forgot me, what about me?
Used to be like P.B. (Help me, please)

[Chorus]
You must be the only child because you're so stingy
I just wanna go buck wild, but you don't defend me
I been on the fuckin' prowl, I been countin' Benjis
You done turned my heart so cold, I should work at Friendly's
(Ain't shit sweet)
Darlin', darlin', I've been prayin' for you, for you
For you

[Refrain]
You ain't never think about nobody but yourself
Selfish
Man, I really can't wait until you gon' need my help
Helpless
You ain't never think about nobody but yourself
Selfish
Man, I really can't wait until you gon' need my help

[Verse 2]
Every move you make, man, I swear it seem suspicious
Lyin' through your teeth, so I don't rush to give you kisses
Spiteful and malicious, hope that other chick got syphilis
Sick of this, hard to stomach, now that nigga shittin' bricks
Hypocrite, punch you in yo' lip, oh shit, you slippin', sis
Used to arch my back for you and now I'm your arch-nemesis
All men should be feminist, Donald Trump fucks immigrants
I don't want to work it out, so cancel our gym membership
I'ma leave this nigga, don't believe me, nigga?
I was make-believin', nigga, it was only one season, nigga
M.O.D., my nigga, money over dick
Money over dick, you should stop breathin', nigga

[Chorus]
You must be the only child because you're so stingy
I just wanna go buck wild when you don't defend me
I been on the fuckin' prowl, I been countin' Benjis
You done turned my heart so cold, I should work at Friendly's
(Ain't shit sweet)
Darlin', darlin', I've been prayin' for you, for you
(I been prayin' for ya, I been prayin' for ya) For you
(I been prayin', I been, I been, I been prayin' for you)
Darlin', darlin', I've been callin' on God for you (Hope that He pick up)
No, for you (Jesus Christ, pick up)
Ooh
