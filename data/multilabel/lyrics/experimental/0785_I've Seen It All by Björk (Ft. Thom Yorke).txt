I've seen it all, I have seen the trees
I've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze
I've seen a man killed by his best friend
And lives that were over before they were spent
I've seen what I was, and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all — there is no more to see

[Verse 2: Björk & Thom Yorke]
You haven't seen elephants, kings, or Peru!
I'm happy to say I had better to do
What about China? Have you seen the Great Wall?
All walls are great if the roof doesn't fall

[Verse 3: Björk & Thom Yorke]
And the man you will marry?
The home you will share?
To be honest, I really don't care

[Verse 4: Björk & Thom Yorke]
You've never been to Niagara Falls?
I have seen water, it's water, that's all
The Eiffel Tower, the Empire State?
My pulse was as high on my very first date
Your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?
To be honest, I really don't care

I've seen it all, I have seen the dark
I have seen the brightness in one little spark
I've seen what I choose and I've seen what I need
And that is enough, to want more would be greed
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be
I've seen it all —  there is no more to see

[Verse 6: Thom Yorke with Björk]
You've seen it all and all you have seen
You can always review on your own little screen
The light and the dark, the big and the small
Just keep in mind — you need no more at all
You've seen what you were and know what you'll be
You've seen it all — there is no more to see
