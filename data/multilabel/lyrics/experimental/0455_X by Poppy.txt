Ooh
Heavy

[Verse 1]
I wanna love everyone
Empty every bullet out of every gun
Please take me back to where we began
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba

[Chorus]
Get me, get me bloody, please get me bloody
Get me, get me bloody, please get me bloody
You can get down on your knees if you're naughty
(You can get down on your knees if you're naughty)
Get me, get me bloody, please get me bloody
(Get me, get me bloody, please get me bloody)

[Post-Chorus]
Poetry, poetry, poetry
Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy
Poetry, poetry, poetry
Ecstasy, ecstasy, ecstasy

[Verse 2]
Maybe we can save the world
From every evil boy and dangerous girl
Please make me believe in harmony
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba

(Get me, get me bloody, please get me bloody)

[Outro]
I wanna love everyone
Empty every bullet out of every gun
Maybe I can save the world
For every boy and every girl
Take me back
Take me back
Take me back to the place where we began
