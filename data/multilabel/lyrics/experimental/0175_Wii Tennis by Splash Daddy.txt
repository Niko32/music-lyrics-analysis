Damn, I have no socks. Damn, where are my socks?
I'm always fucking late 'cause I smoke a lot
If we had a date, yeah, I'm sorry, I forgot
Twenty minutes late, pullin' up to my job
Yeah, I smoke a joint just to roll a fucking blunt
Yeah, I'm rocking camo pants but I ain't tryna hunt
I-I haven't done my laundry in about a month
It-it's okay, I'd buy a whole new outfit just to stunt
Wai-wait you hate on me but at my show you're in the front?
Hold up, you're fake, hold up you're done

[Chorus]
Pull up in Corolla, purple drank, but it's soda
Stack it up just like this shit be pagoda
Bitch, I sense your fakeness like I'm motherfuckin' Yoda
Like I'm Yoda, ayy, yuh, like I'm Yoda
I can't fuck with you 'cause you don't fuck with me, ayy
You and your crew full of jealousy, ayy
I be so hot, hot just like some tea, ayy
Feelin' like the best playing tennis on the Wii
On the Wii
Got these motherfuckin' Nikes on my feet, ayy
I got the recipe I cook like Lil B, ayy
Watch me get it, ayy, yuh, you will see, ayy, yuh, you will see
Playing tennis on the Wii
Watch me fuckin' get it
You will see, ayy, you will see
Playing tennis on the Wii
You might also like[Chorus]
Pull up in Corolla, purple drank but it's soda
Stack it up just like this shit be pagoda
Bitch, I sense your fakeness like I'm motherfuckin' Yoda
Like I'm Yoda, ayy, yuh, like I'm Yoda
Pull up in Corolla, purple drank but it's soda
Stack it up just like this shit be pagoda
Bitch, I sense your fakeness like I'm motherfuckin' Yoda
Like I'm Yoda, ayy, yuh, like I'm Yoda
I can't fuck with you 'cause you don't fuck with me, ayy
You and your crew full of jealousy, ayy
I be so hot, hot just like some tea, ayy
Feelin' like the best playing tennis on the Wii
