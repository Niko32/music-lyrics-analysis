Get up
Beats 'bout waist deep
Swallowed by beats
I stay niche
I've seen footage

[Verse 1]
What's that? Can't tell
Handheld dream shot in hell
Deep space ghetto streets (Streets, streets)
Show me somethin' I ain't seen before
Mystery 'hind that death door
Juke step electrocute the floor
What's the science of flyin' that high?
Got a no-no goin' one time
Creeps up behind me
Over my shoulder
Turn around, try to see, but it's nowhere
Noided, noided, static on my blindside
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage
You might also like[Chorus]
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay-
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay- (Noided, noided)
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay-
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay- (Noided, noided)
I've seen

[Verse 2]
Everybody's knowin'
Where ya think you're goin', ain't goin' nowhere
Satellite, handle that
With a lead pipe
Who captures life
Who takes what's left, who stay
On that next, already know my gillicutti, like I told you
Don't touch me
What's up with it
(I stay noided) Stimulation overload account for it
Desensitized by the mass amounts of shit
(I've seen) I've seen it, I've been it
Can't delete it, feels like jail (Noided)
Full Moon in the klink
Shining, don't sleep
Surveillance post my bail
[Chorus]
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay-
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay- (Noided, noided)
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay-
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay- (Noided, noided)
I've seen

[Verse 3]
Armored cop open fire Glock
On some kid who stepped so
Fast was hard to grasp what even happened
'Til you seen that head blow
Off his shoulders in slow-mo
Rewind that, it's so cold (Noided)
Rewind that, it's so cold (Noided)
I've seen footage, I stay noided
Juke step with so much boy-rude looseness
Seem like no bones in him skin (Noided)
My jaw hit the floor, like, "This real footage
Gotta see that one mo' 'gain"
(I stay) Ambulance hit and run over pedestrian in Brazil
Little tiger, boy soldier
Twist cap back and kill (Noided)
[Bridge]
Seen crazy shit, man, crazy shit
Seen crazy shit, man, crazy shit, crazy
I've seen crazy shit, crazy shit, crazy shit, crazy shit
Crazy shit, crazy shit, crazy shit, crazy shit
I've seen crazy shit, crazy shit, crazy shit, crazy shit
Crazy shit, crazy shit, crazy shit, crazy shit
[Chorus]
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay noided
I've seen, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay noided (Noided, noided)
I've seen footage, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay noided
I've seen, I stay noided, I've seen footage, I stay noided (Noided, noided)
