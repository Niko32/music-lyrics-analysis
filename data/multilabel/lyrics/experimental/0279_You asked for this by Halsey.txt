I don't know what you want from me
When I'm sunburnt lips and summer feet
I'm tattered like these Levi jeans
Punch-wasted on redundancy
Now what the fuck does all this mean?
You know I'm still somebody's daughter, see
I spilled the milk you left for me
My tears are fallin' flawlessly now

[Chorus]
Go on and be a big girl
You asked for this now
Go on and be a big girl
Or everybody's gonna drown you out
Go on and be a big girl
You asked for this now
You better show 'em why you talk so loud

[Verse 2]
You wished upon a falling star
And then left behind the avant-garde
For lemonade in crystal glassеs
Picket fences, filе taxes
Who the hell is in your bed?
You better kiss goodnight and give some head
And then next, the morning comes instead
Well, is this the life that lies ahead now?
You might also like[Chorus]
Go on and be a big girl
You asked for this now
Go on and be a big girl
Or everybody's gonna drown you out
Go on and be a big girl
You asked for this now
You better show 'em why you talk so loud
Well, go on and be a big girl
You asked for this now
Go on and be a big girl
Or everybody's gonna drown you out
Go on and be a big girl
You asked for this now
You better show 'em why you talk so loud

[Outro]
I want my cake on a silver platter
I want a fistful in my hands
I want a beautiful boy's despondent laughter
I wanna ruin all my plans
I want a fist around my throat
I wanna cry so hard, I choke
I want everything I asked for
Ah
Ah, ah
Ah, ah
