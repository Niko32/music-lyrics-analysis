I saw your picture
Hanging on the back of my door
Won't give you my heart
No one lives there anymore
And we were lovers
Now we can't be friends
Fascination ends
Here we go again, oh-oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Robert Smith]
'Cause it's cold outside
When you coming home?
'Cause it's hot inside
Isn't that enough?

[Chorus: Robert Smith]
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love

[Verse 2: Robert Smith]
Could it be that
Time has taken its toll?
Won't take you so far
I am in control
And we were lovers
Now we can't be friends
Fascination ends
Here we go again, oh-oh-oh
You might also like[Pre-Chorus: Robert Smith]
'Cause it's cold outside
When you coming home?
'Cause it's hot inside
Isn't that enough?

[Chorus: Robert Smith]
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love

[Bridge: Ethan Kath]
(Now we can't be friends)
(Fascination ends)
(Here we go again, oh-oh-oh)
('Cause it's cold outside)
(When you coming home?)
('Cause it's hot inside)
(Isn't that enough?)

[Chorus: Robert Smith]
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
I'm not in love
[Outro: Robert Smith]
We are not in love
We are not in love
We are not in love
We are not in love
We are not in love
