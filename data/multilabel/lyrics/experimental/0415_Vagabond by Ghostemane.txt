It all started when ya'

[Verse 1]
Left me for dead, now I've been a wreck and mama told me daddy ain't gonna be back
And she told me I'm the man now, I guess I'm the man now, think I need a plan now, uh (A- a- ah)
Must've been nothing but a jit, buck teeth cut like a bowl so that you know
Started from the bottom fighting all the way up up, I never wanna go back down
Update, I felt great for a minute straight, call my shrink and tell him I made a mistake
If only I could delete all the pain and upload all the things I wanted to be
Bled from my lip, bit down on it, feel the pain and a taste so metallic
Soulless, I learned to live without it, but I'ma make it out of this so count on it

[Bridge]
It all started when I...
It all started when I...
It all started when I...
It all started when I...

[Verse 2]
Cut the black blood from your tongue like Lavinia
No more lies, no, not a one, I wasn't your favorite son
If only I could forget, if only I could delete
If only, if only I could delete my memory
I still would not upload everything you wanted me to be
No, truly, I'm happy you're deceased
I don't want nothing
I want everything, I want everything, I want everything

You left me for dead, all that died was my innocence
Ooh

[Outro]
Uh, it all started when you left me for dead, now I've been a wreck, mama told me daddy won't be coming back
Bled from my lip, bit down on it, felt the pain and a taste so metallic
