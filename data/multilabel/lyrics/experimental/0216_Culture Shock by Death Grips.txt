So softly a supergod dies...

[Verse 1]
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Useless information occupies every open space inside your skull
You know what's going on every day, every night
Everywhere, swear you're so international
Upside down cross on the Jumbotron
Wait up, hold on
Blowing anthrax off my palms
Say what, you're wrong
Switch stance, face plant
Napalm fire starters
Flatlander, plug puller
Nose dive turbulence chartered
You speak in abbreviations because real life conversation moves too slow
You're the media's creation, yeah, your free will has been taken and you don't know

[Refrain]
Cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

[Chorus]
Cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
(God blocker)
Cu-cu-cu
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
You need to vibrate higher—
Cu-cu-cu
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
(God blocker)
Cu-cu-cu
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
You need to vibrate higher—

Never seen without one hundred
She's a satanic priestess
Anarchy on ice freak flag
Flying faceless elitist
Crow on the down low end
Reppin' Orion's belt
Atlantis ancient vagina
Getting dusty on the shelf
Enter the pigs don't get it
No hands I'm shattering jaws
Double nickles on the dime
Fuck glam can lick my balls

[Refrain]
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

[Verse 3]
Whatchya gonna be when you're grown, young blood?
Gonna be a helpless drone
Won't ever have to think
No, your head'll be linked directly to your cell phone
The virus is alive, I can see it in your eyes
The infection is full blown
Cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu
Career killer, double-decker packed with suicidal brides
Four-armed fury in a filthy dream about splitting your bitches' thighs
Enters through unknowing eyes
Touch the keys, it's in your mind
Can't delete it and soon you'll find
How bad you need it all the time
[Chorus]
Cu-cu-cu
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

Cu-cu-cu
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
You need to vibrate higher—
Cu-cu-cu
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
(God blocker)
Cu-cu-cu
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
You need to vibrate higher—

[Verse 4]
Shiva slashin' through your flat screen
Is nowhere for you to hide
Strangled by anaconda thumbs to the soundtrack of world genocide
My thoughts tie knots in silver spoons
Vampire on the rise
Punk a chump with a cunt for brains platoon
In the zone and on the grind
[Bridge]
Dead matter disposer from the mountains without peaks
Catch and release (Release)
Time released horse capsule swallowed to wake the savage beast
Cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu
Keep up or get left behind
Cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu
Culture shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
Gotta get them outta here now
Infected, act so weird
How'd you get it? You're pathetic
Cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu-cu
Quarantine the virus, God blocker

[Chorus]
Cu-cu-cu
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
(God blocker)
Cu-cu-cu
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
You need to vibrate higher—
Cu-cu-cu
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself
(God blocker)
Cu-cu-cu
Culture shock, future shock
Fuck yourself, choke yourself

[Outro]
You need to vibrate higher so you can capture the opening of the portal that connects this earth of 3D to one earth of 4D or 5D
