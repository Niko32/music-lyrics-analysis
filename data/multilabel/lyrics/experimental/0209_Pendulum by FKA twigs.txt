I'm a sweet...
Little love maker
Finding time
To make my words better
Lately I'm...
Not so present now
Not enough
For your constant found

[Pre-Chorus]
I've got time, but you're tired of waiting
You only want me in open spaces
Can't fill your gaps with people
I know no-one

[Chorus]
So lonely trying to be yours
When you're looking for so much more

[Verse 2]
You forget...
How we fell in love
I'm your sweet...
Little love maker
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
You're younger than I am broken
I dance feelings like they're spoken
So my conversation's not enough

[Chorus]
So lonely trying to be yours
Running through sliding doors
So lonely trying to be yours
When you're looking for so much more
(More, more)

[Bridge]
(So lonely trying)
How does it feel to have me thinking about you?
Wishing my words were enough to consume you
(So lonely trying to be yours)
How does it feel to have me thinking about you?
[Chorus]
So lonely trying to be yours
Running through sliding doors
So lonely trying to be yours
When you're looking for so much more

[Outro]
To be yours
Ugh, to be yours
