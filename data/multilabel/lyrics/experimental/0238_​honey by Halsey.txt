She told me, "Open your mouth," she said, "I got a surprise"
And so I opened it wide and then she crawled inside
She's on the tip of my tongue, she's on the top of my thighs
And if I searched a thousand miles, I'd be dyin' to find

[Pre-Chorus]
Between my fingers, she leaves, then she lingers
If she's gonna go, well, then I'm goin' with her
I know that I won't forget

[Chorus]
She was sweet like honey
But all I can taste is the blood in my mouth
And the bitterness in goodbyе
Drippin' like honey
Down the back of my throat and on thе front of my mind
And well, she's impatient and I'm complacent
With just a little taste of wastin' time
Lookin' for honey
Well, she stings like she means it, she's mean and she's mine

[Verse 2]
Out and about without a reason or rhyme
And now she's dancin' on a table and she spins on a dime
But she's hell in a basket, just makin' a racket
I love every second, it's fuckin' fantastic
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Good things aren't easy to get
I know that I won't regret

[Chorus]
She was sweet like honey
And all I can taste is the blood in my mouth
And the bitterness in goodbye
Drippin' like honey
Down the back of my throat and on the front of my mind
And well, she's impatient and I'm complacent
With just a little taste of wastin' time
Lookin' for honey
Well, she stings like she means it, she's mean and she's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Between my fingers, she leaves, then she lingers
If she's gonna go, well, then I'm goin' with her
And I know that I won't forget

[Chorus]
She was sweet like honey
But all I can taste is the blood in my mouth
And the bitterness in goodbye
Drippin' like honey
Down the back of my throat and on the front of my mind
And well, she's impatient and I'm complacent
With just a little taste of wastin' time
Lookin' for honey
Well, she stings like she means it, she's mean and she's mine
