Who else?
I wonder how I'll find new love
Someone said "You've got to get help"
And I can't help asking myself, "Is this all there is to it?"

[Verse]
In the flesh
When no one's watching I'm someone else
(I cut my head off)
Talk out your neck, and no one listens
Who would've guessed?
(Grow a new face)
Chocolate will kill you softly
Dust in the air, it tastes like almond crush
I inhale, there's something else out there
I want to know what it feels like

[Bridge]
I want to meet someone (Ooh-ooh)
Oh, let's go have some fun (Ooh-ooh)
I want a human body (Ooh-ooh)
I want to be someone (Ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
Who else?
I wonder how I'll find new love
Someone said "You've got to get help"
And I can't help asking myself "Is this all there is to it?"
(New love)
You might also like[Bridge]
Ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I want a human body, yeah
I want it, huh, yeah
Oh, let's go have some fun

[Chorus]
Who else?
I wonder how I'll find new love
Someone said "You've got to get help"
And I can't help asking myself "Is this all there is to it?"
(New love)
