(Think about you, 'bout you all week)
Hey, I made you a mixtape
(Work hard, get my body, body lean)
Because when I feel you, I feel me
(Love plays, called hide and seek)
And when I feel me, it feels good
(That's why I've been standing in the bright lights for you)
(You want a get a bit of my mystique-stique?)
I'm still that mysterious bitch
(Play ooh-là-là, très chic)
'Cause no one does it like I do
(Been working in the studio all week)
I keep it moving, keep on dancing
(Think about you all week)
For you
So if you

[Chorus]
Really wanna kiss me, kiss me
(Do it quickly, do it, do it, do it, quickly, do it, do it)
Really wanna kiss me, kiss me, quickly, you
(Do it quickly, do it, do it, do it, quickly, do it, do it)
Kiss me, baby
Really wanna kiss me, kiss me, quickly, you
(Do it quickly, do it, do it, do it, quickly, do it, do it)
Kiss me, do it quickly
I've been waiting for so long
(Do it quickly, do it, do it, do it, quickly, do it, do it)

Waiting a minute for your love
When you gonna take me out to play?
There, there, at work all day
You got me feeling some type of way
But I got lovers waiting in a long line for me
You wanna get a bit of my mystique?
Play ooh-là-là, très chic (Get you a ticket)
Gets lonely in the studio all week
I'm the boss of my life, do I really have to boss in the sheets?

[Chorus]
If you really wanna kiss me, kiss me
(Do it quickly, do it, do it, do it, quickly, do it, do it)
Really wanna kiss me, kiss me, quickly, you
(Do it quickly, do it, do it, do it, quickly, do it, do it)
Kiss me, baby (Kiss me, kiss me)
(Do it quickly, do it, do it, do it, quickly, do it, do it)
Kiss me, do it quickly
I've been waiting for so long (Kiss me, kiss me)
(Do it quickly, do it, do it, do it, quickly, do it, do it)

[Outro]
Ride the dragon
'Cause I've been waiting for a minute
Waiting for an hour, now it's getting long
So if you really wanna kiss me
Do it quickly 'fore the end of the song
'Cause I've been skipping through the city
Feeling pretty with nobody to get on
So if you really wanna kiss me
Do it quickly 'fore the end of the song
Waiting a minute for your love
