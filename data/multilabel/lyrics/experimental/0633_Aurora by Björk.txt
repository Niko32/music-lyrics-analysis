Threading
The glacier head
Looking hard for
Moments of shine
From twilight
To twilight

[Chorus]
Aurora
Goddess sparkle
Shoot me
Beyond this suffer
The need is great
Aurora

[Chorus]
Aurora
Goddess sparkle
A mountain shade
Suggests your shape
I tumbled down
On my knees
Fill the mouth
With snow
You might also like[Verse 2]
The way it melts
I wish to melt into you

[Chorus]
Aurora

[Outro]
Spark the sun off (Spark the sun off)
Spark the sun off (Spark the sun off)
Spark the sun off (Spark the sun off)
Spark the sun off for me
