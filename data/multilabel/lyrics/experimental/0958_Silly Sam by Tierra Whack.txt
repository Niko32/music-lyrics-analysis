Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Mm-mm, mmm

[Chorus]
Silly Sam, what a man
Not a fan, oh yeah, damn
You play so many games
Tic-tac-toe, Mario
Dominoes, and Uno

[Bridge]
If you play your cards right, it’ll be alright
And if you don’t you’re in Trouble for Life

[Verse]
Sorry don’t live here, it ain’t sincere
Patty cake, Patty Cake, fuck Patty, Patty fake
Get a Clue, Guess Who, yes, you, that’s who
Checkers, Chess too, player one, I'm a player too

[Chorus]
Silly Sam, what a man
Not a fan, oh yeah, damn
You play so many games
Tic-tac-toe, Mario (And Luigi)You might also like
