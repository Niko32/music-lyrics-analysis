Sun pour, sweat drop, head high, heart stop
Winter drug, summer death (SUV my leg up)
Bed bug, insane, gang, I'm fed up
Get up off the pavement, give a fuck where I end up
Late night, send up, Rugrats, stand up
Riding in the Chevrolet, crack you like a chestnut
All bad get up, Willy Wonka colored bucks
World of snakes so these butterflies get corrupt

[Post-Chorus]
Wait up for me, hold on tight

[Verse]
Dead town, dead cops, head low, bedrock
Chopping teriyaki in the sushi shop, get chopped
My house, dead stop, knife shine, so sharp
Team of addicts and bosses, we bossed up (Bossed up)
Your gang so sus, no, you can't hang with us
Bigger than religion, I'm your sensei, I'm your mentor
Heads fly, head up, in Boston like the Red Sox
All-star, no face, ski mask my agenda
All-star, no face, ski mask my agenda
All-star, no face, ski mask my agenda

[Chorus]
Sun pours, sweat drop, head high, heart stop
Winter drug, summer death, SUV my leg up
Bed bug, insane, gang, I'm fed up
Get up off the pavement, give a fuck where I end up
Late night, send up, Rugrats, stand up
Riding in the Chevrolet, crack you like you chestnut
All bad, get up, dead town, dead cops
All-star, no face, ski mask my agendaYou might also like
