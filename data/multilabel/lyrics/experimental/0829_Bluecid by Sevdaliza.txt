Man with a cigarette
I'd always look around for his fitting threat
I'm torn between obsession and hate
For the mess that he made me make

[Verse 2]
Man with a cigarette
I'd always wonder if we'd benefit
I'm torn between the mess that you made
For the mess that he made me make

[Refrain]
And I could only have you in my dreams
Oh, so it seems, so it seems
And I could only have you in my dreams
Oh, so it seems, so it seems
And I could only have you in my dreams
So it seems
And I could only have you in my dreams
So it seems, so it seems
And I could only have you in my dreams
Oh, so it seems, so it seemsYou might also like
