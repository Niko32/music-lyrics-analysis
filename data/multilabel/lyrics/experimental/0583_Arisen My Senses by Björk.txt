Was all there is
Every cell in my body
Lined up for you
Legs a little open
Once again
Awaken my senses
Head topless
Arisen my senses
Just that kiss
Was all there is
My palms pulsating of
The things I want to do to you
Just that kiss
Is all there is
Weaving a mixtape
With every crossfade
For him a he
Is WWW
For him a he
Is WWW
Once again
Weaving a mixtape
With every song

For who I am
For, for, with love

Awaken my senses
Just that kiss
Once again
Was all there is
Just that kiss
Once again
Arisen my senses
Was all there is
Once again
Just that kiss
Arisen my senses
Was all there is
For him a he
Once again I'm made to merge
With him, for him a he
I'm made to merge
With him, for him a he
Am I keen, or keen, or not keen?
For him a he
Too keen, too seen, to be seen
Am I keen, or keen, or not keen?
Once again I'm made to merge
With him, by him, he sees me for who I
Am I keen, or keen, or not keen?
To be seen or not seen
With him a he
Am I keen, or keen, or not keen?
With him, him, he sees me for who I am
