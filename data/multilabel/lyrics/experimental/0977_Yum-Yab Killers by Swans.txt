I saw a white finger
On a barbed wire fence
I knew it was dangerous
But I took the risk
And yes it was sweet
So sweet to eat
Now see how the flesh
Is pricked and bleeds
Yeah, it bleeds
It bleeds, see how it bleeds
It bleeds, see how it bleeds

[Verse 2]
I saw a little baby
Crawling down the street
I said hey come over here baby
Cause you look beautiful to eat
I said come over, dear
You know what I'll do
Well I'll make you my mirror
Of the things that I chew

[Hook 1]

We are the wild
We are the risk
Come little Yum-Yab
Come slash your wrist
We are the wild
We are the risk
Come little Yum-Yab
Gimme a kiss
We are the wild
We are the risk
Come little Yum-Yab
Come slash your wrist
We are the wild
We are the risk
Come little Yum-Yab
Gimme a kiss

[Hook 2]
And blow your brains ah-out, ah-ah-out, ah-out
Blow your brains ah-out, ah-ah-out, ah-out

I'll blow your brains ah-out, ah-ah-out, ah-out
Blow your brains ah-out, ah-ah-out, ah-out

Now blow your brains ah-out, ah-ah-out, ah-out
Now blow your brains ah-out, ah-ah-out, ah-out
