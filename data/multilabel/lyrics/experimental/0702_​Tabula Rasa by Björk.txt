We are all swollen
From hiding his affairs
Let's put it all on the table
Let it all out
It is time
He mustn't steal our light

[Chorus 1]
Clean plate: Tabula rasa for my children
Clean plate: Not repeating the fuck-ups of the fathers

[Verse 2]
My deepest wish
Is that you're immersed in grace and dignity
But you will have to deal with shit soon enough
I hoped to give you the least amount of luggage
Got the right to make your own fresh mistakes
And not repeat others' failures

[Chorus 2]
Clean plate: Tabula rasa for my children
Let's clean up: Break the chain of the fuck-ups of the fathers
It is time: For us women to rise and not just take it lying down
It is time: The world is listening
You might also like[Interlude]
Oh, how I love you
Embarrassed to pass this mess over to you
But he led two lives
Thought ours was the only one

[Outro]
You are strong
You are strong
You are strong
You're so strong
