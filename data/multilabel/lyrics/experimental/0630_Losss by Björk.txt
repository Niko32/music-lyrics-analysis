We all are struggling, just doing our best
We've gone through the grinder, suffered loss
Lost to, to which everything flows, an absence which
Attracts floral blooming softly

[Verse 2]
Soft is my chest, I didn't allow loss
Loss make me hate, didn't harden from pain
This pain we have will always be there
But the sense of full satisfaction too

[Chorus 1]
I opened my heart for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically
We're finally vulnerable

[Verse 3]
Loss of love, we all have suffered
How we make up for it defines who we, who we are
It defines us, how we overcome it
Recover, repair from loss

[Verse 4]
Loss of faith just ignites survivors
They stare doubt straight into the eye
I forgive, the past is bondage
Freedom aphrodisiac
You might also like[Chorus 2]
I've opened my heart for you
Tied ribbons on my ankles for you
Drew orchids on my thighs for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically
Tied ribbons on my ankles for you
Drew orchids on my thighs for you
Your lower lip so heavy on you
My spine curved erotically
We're finally vulnerable
