I can't breathe when you’re not with me
Say your body on fleek, but I need to see
Girl, this an odyssey
All these problems in these sheets
Girl, said you'd never leave
But I never would believe, girl

[Verse 1]
'Cause I can’t breathe when you're not with me
Girl, hottest in the street, need to turn off your TV, girl
I took too many shots and they all get it now
I shot all of the cops, yeah, they ain't dealing with us
That was six o'clock but I had to call myself in, on the run
Lil' mama, she was done, she couldn't deal with the grudge
Your parents didn't mind, explain your love
Need to feel more touch, let the windows roll up
Let my niggas roll up, then we all roll up, oh

[Verse 2]
Though I fucking told ya, ooh
ERYS with the soldiers, ooh
No Land Rovers, ooh
'Bout to call Elon Musk
Going nuts in the club
Six blunts, six ****
Got umbrellas in the clut, ooh
In case they tryna keep up, ooh
They face looks stuck
They face fake as fuck
And my girl caked up
Wearing no make up, ooh
You might also like[Verse 3]
It’s a vibe, it’s a vibe, it's a vibe
Hypnotized by the moon and the sky
I just flew in from the six, no lie
Hit a swish we ain’t even have to try
Man, okay, pull up to the party, put the party on a wave
And I got the posse with me, partners and the gang
Niggas said we playing but we do a lot of things
Know your boy J got a seven tier race
Emirates to Dubai, sipping fly, same-same
Get it every time and we try same same
Teaspoon of vision make the pain go away
Got a beef with a nigga, please just say it to my face

[Non-Lyrical Vocal Interlude]

[Chorus]
I can't breathe when you're not with me
Say your body on fleek, but I need to see
Girl, this an odyssey
All these problems in these streets
Girl, said you'd never leave
But I never would believe, girl

[Breakdown]
I can’t breathe when you're not with me
I don't give a fuck, criss cross
Turn shit, disolve
And you done, no cap
Too strung and I'm ******, dude i did this on the plug
[Verse 4]
Label called said they want a hit, I give a fuck
Got some demons on my chest, I gotta get 'em off
Say you wanna ball but you not even in the park
When it's light out you be talking
When you wouldn't when it's dark

[Outro]
We're lost, we're lost, we're lost, we're low
When I'm with you, you make me feel at home
I care about you so much more than you know
I'm calling girl, but you don't answer the phone
I'm falling girl, my life is dominoes
