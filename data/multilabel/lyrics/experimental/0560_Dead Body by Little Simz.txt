We all have our demons
Our thoughts, our imperfections and our insecurities
None of which make us inhumane
This is our tale
The proton, the neutron and the electron
The positive, the negative and the ground
The trial, the person and the story of
Do you wanna see a dead body?
Prolly not

[Verse 1]
Real dark in the cemetery
Where the souls lie, oh my
What've I become, man, I’m so high
Quit killing my buzz
Love drunk in the maze like: "What have you done?
Where the hell are you taking me?
What are we running from?"
Demons in the back of my closet, don’t talk to them
You wouldn’t want to be me, 'cuz I’ve walked with them
And it wasn’t a nice walk: traumatised
Left me in a bad head space
Lookin' to Heaven’s door, I've been saved, or have I?
Asked for forgiveness, can I or will I?
Negative at heart, am I?
Or shall I explain what the world done to me?
You wouldn’t understand what I been through fully
And these dark thoughts never been new to me
And nobody lovin' me; everybody through with me
Everybody lookin' at me different
And nobody’ll listen
I can see you starin' at me: what do you envision?
No faith in me, should I resort to religion?
But even, I could never change the life I’m livin'
I’m a druggie, I’m a fiend
Neva' been clean
Soul’s always been tainted
Homeless: what'chu know about livin' on the street?
Cold nights, you know, right? Nothin' to eat
Figured that you wouldn't give me money anyways
Even though I hear the coins rattlin' in your jeans
I ain’t even beggin' no more
Fuck it! Maybe I’ll just beg a little more
But don’t judge me
God above me, why do you have me livin' like a junkie?
Fuck, man
Do you wanna see a dead body?
Prolly not
Dark clouds, nigga, fuck a rainbow
Nobody talk until I say so
I just might sell my soul, if it’s worth anything
But we’ll see how the day goes
You might also like[Chorus]
I just might sell my soul
Cause I don't feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?
Will anybody miss me?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Prolly not
I'mma sell my soul
Cause I don't feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?
Do you wanna see a dead body?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Prolly not

[Verse 2]
Ooh, mind’s on overload!
Hit straight to the face, might overdose!
This ain’t the life I chose: what would you know?
This ain’t the beginning: I ain’t even come close
Bare robbing, activity indulge
Is it very human? I don’t think I have a pulse
Blacked out in the night, nigga
Devil on both shoulders: ain't no motherfuckin' angel to my right, nigga!
Have you ever seen a grown man cry? Never me
Shit, I need that nicotine
Heals me like medicine
Gotta be aware all times
Better be dogs out here
Lookin' for a different pedigree
Know you see it
Never get too comfy
Me nuh' trust nobody
Feds always wanna roll on me
I ain’t done nuttin', I’m so sorry
You can take time, no hurry
Even though that I ain’t slept for days
My body’s aching, but my mind’s awake
Shit, the flow is crazy, I should rhyme for change
Oh, dear lady, gimme the time of day
See you a mile away
I can never own up to my mistakes
Perhaps, it’ll take me to a higher state
No escape, I’m tryin' to find a way
I’m the one that you was tryna save
Please, give up, you don’t have time to waste
This is real, I’ve been waitin' my whole life to feel
Do you wanna see a dead body? No chill
[Chorus]
I just might sell my soul
Cause I don't feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?
Will anybody miss me?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Prolly not
I'mma sell my soul
Cause I don't feel like I am a part of the world no more
Will anybody miss me when I’m gone?
Do you wanna see a dead body?
Have you ever seen a dead body?
Prolly not
