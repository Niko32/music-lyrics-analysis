And he's willing to do whatever it takes to give first love a second ch—

[Refrain]
I could be the one to take you home
Late nights, staring at your phone
I could make you feel like you're in love
I could be the one to make you quit
Late nights, when you feel like shit
I could make you feel so damn alone

[Pre-Chorus]
If you took my place
Would you change my ways?
Would you change my name?
Would you change my face?
If you took my spot
Would you change a lot?
Would you change it all?
Would you change it-it-it-it—

[Chorus]
Maybe this is what I get for leaving you out in the cold
Drag my body to the woods and let mе go
Paint a picture of my life into the snow
Pull thе trigger like I'd never even know
Maybe this is what I get for leaving you out in the rain
Pop the trunk and drop my body in the grain
Throw a shovel at me, yell to dig a grave
Put the pistol to my ear, I heard it say
In the black-on-black or the white-on-white
It don't matter what you wear when you die, right?
In the 605 or the 212
It don't matter where you go when I find you
You can run all day, you can run all night
But in the end, you know I'm always right, oh no
In the 605 or the 212
It don't matter where you go when I find you
It don't matter where you go when I find you

I could be the one to take you home
Late nights, staring at your phone
I could make you feel like you're in love (I could make you feel like you're in love)
I could be the one to make you quit
Late nights, when you feel like shit
I could make you feel so damn alone

[Pre-Chorus]
If you took my place
Would you change my ways?
Would you change my name?
Would you change my face?
If you took my spot
Would you change a lot?
Would you change it all?
Would you change it-it-it-it—

[Chorus]
Maybe this is what I get for leaving you out in the cold
Drag my body to the woods and let me go
Paint a picture of my life into the snow
Pull the trigger like I'd never even know
Maybe this is what I get for leaving you out in the rain
Pop the trunk and drop my body in the grain
Throw a shovel at me, yell to dig a grave
Put the pistol to my ear, I heard it say
In the black-on-black or the white-on-white
It don't matter what you wear when you die, right?
In the 605 or the 212
It don't matter where you go when I find you
You can run all day, you can run all night
But in the end, you know I'm always right, oh no
In the 605 or the 212
It don't matter where you go when I find you
It don't matter where you go when I find you
[Outro]
I could be the one to take you home
Late nights, staring at your phone
I could make you feel like you're in love
I could be the one to make you quit
Late nights when you feel like shit
I could make you feel so damn alone
