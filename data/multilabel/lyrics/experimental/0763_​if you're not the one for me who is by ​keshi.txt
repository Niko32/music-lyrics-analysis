Who? (If you're not the one for me, who is?)
Who?

[Verse 1]
Softly dream about the days (If you're not the one for me, who is?)
(No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no) Love me
(No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no)
And tell me that you'll stay (No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no)
(No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no)

[Chorus]
(I need you)
If you're not the one for me, who is?
(I need you)
If you're not the one for me, who is?
(Jesus, show yourself)
Who? (If you're not the one for me, who is?)
Who?

[Bridge]
You've made me (If you're not the one for me, who is?)
Don't leave me
In a sense (No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no)
It's feelin' like the end of innocence
(No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no)
It's feelin' like the end (No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no, no-no-no)

(I need you)
If you're not the one for me, who is?
(I need you)
If you're not the one for me, who is?
(Jesus, show yourself)
Who, who?

[Outro]
If you're not the one for me, who is?
(If you're not the one for me, who is?)
(Jesus, show yourself)
