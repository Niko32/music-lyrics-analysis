It's all for the gain
It’s all for the lovers tryna take the breath away
It's all for the gain
It's all for the lovers tryna chase the rush again
It’s all for the gain
It's all for the lovers tryna take the breath away
It's all for the gain
It's all for the lovers tryna chase the rush again

[Chorus]
But I'm never gonna give up
Though I'm probably gonna think about you all the time
And for the lovers who found a mirrored heart
They just remind me I'm without you

[Post-Chorus]
Did you want me all?
No, not for life
Did you truly see me?
No, not this time
Were you ever sure?
No, no, no, not with me

[Verse 2]
That's why it’s all for the gain
It’s all for the lovers tryna patch the pain away
Its all for the gain
It's all for the lovers tryna fuck away the pain
You might also like[Chorus]
But I’m never gonna give up
Though I'm probably gonna think about you all the time
And for the lovers who found a mirrored heart
They just remind me I'm without you

[Post-Chorus]
Did you want me all?
No, not for life
Did you truly see me?
No, not this time
Were you ever sure?
No, no, no, not with me
Did you want me all?
No, not for life
Did you truly see me?
No, not this time
Were you ever sure?
No, no, no, not with me, ooh

[Bridge]
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Ah, ah, ah

[Chorus]
But I'm never gonna give up
Though I’m probably gonna think about you all the time
And for the lovers who found a mirrored heart
They just remind me I'm without you
They just remind me I'm without you
They just remind me I'm without you
