Now Tommy's a good father
Two sons and a daughter
But he wakes up and he asks himself
"Why even bother?"
If he cannot feed his family
The wage he's paid's insanity
Every day he's dealing with a new calamity
Lost his old occupation
But it wasn't immigration
It was a machine, automation that replaced him
Politicians left him, corruption since the Recession
So he grabs his Smith & Wesson and says he'll teach 'em all a lesson like

[Chorus]
"Get down on the ground!
It's a stick up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”
“It’s a stick-up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”

[Verse 2]
Now first he'd lost his pension
Sunk into depression
Congress is defecting
It's been adding to the tension
Came back from war, and he's been post-traumatic stressing
Can't afford his medicine he took for his aggression
He needs help, relying on the system that rejects him
Took away his benefits, but left him with his weapon
Bought a one-way ticket
He's entering the thicket
To do the only thing that he's thinking will make a difference like
You might also like[Chorus]
"Get down on the ground!
It's a stick-up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”
“It’s a stick-up! Nobody make a sound!
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round!
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”

[Bridge]
There's a cold wind blowing
I'm just warning and preparing ya
There's a cold wind blowing
And it's coming for America!
And it's coming for America!
And it's coming for America

[Chorus]
"Get down on the ground!  (On the ground)
It's a stick-up! Nobody make a sound! (Make a sound)
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round! (Emptying a round)
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”
“It’s a stick-up! Nobody make a sound! (Nobody make a sound)
Don't even hiccup, or I'm emptying a round! (Emptying a round)
Oh, I’m done playing games, so I'm going down in flames
Let it rain over Washington!”
