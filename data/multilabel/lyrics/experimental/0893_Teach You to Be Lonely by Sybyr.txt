I can teach you to be lonely, just watch me (I can teach you like me, yeah)
And, baby girl, come and skin me, oh-so promptly (Skin me, skin me, skin me)
Say you runnin' from your demons, I'm not sorry
That ain't my business anymore, sippin' on hot tea (On hot tea)
I can teach you to be lonely, just watch me
And, baby girl, come and skin me, oh-so promptly
Say you runnin' from your demons, I'm not sorry
That ain't my business anymore, sippin' on hot tea

[Verse 1]
I could die at any time (Yeah), pray for death on me (Pray for death on me)
I just wanna ease your soul, so, I collect on me (So, I collect on me)
I know you're doin' better now, we can clearly see (We can clearly see)
I can see a trash can, come and piss in me (Come and piss on me)
Workin' double hours now (Yuh), pickin' pennies up (Pickin' pennies up)
I wanna relate to everyone, so I get double cups (I get double cups)
She said I was interestin', I told her, "We should buckle up" (Come and buckle up)
Told me, "Don't go runnin' 'round again," but, then I got the fuck (Then I got the fuck)
Tryna find my Tumblr (Yeah), but I deleted it (I deleted it)
Skyped her in the mornin', she said she hate my dick (She hate it)
I don't even care now (Yeah), I know I ain't shit
Turnin' on a sociopath (Yeah, yeah), I learned to love it (Yeah, yeah)

[Chorus]
I can teach you to be lonely, just watch me
And, baby girl, come and skin me, oh-so promptly
Say you runnin' from your demons, I'm not sorry
That ain't my business anymore, sippin' on hot tea
I can teach you to be lonely, just watch me
And, baby girl, come and skin me, oh-so promptly
Say you runnin' from your demons, I'm not sorry
That ain't my business anymore, sippin' on hot tea
