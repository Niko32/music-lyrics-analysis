They say love grows, but I've only seen it die
I'm too young to feel like I'm running out of time

[Chorus 1]
I get so scared
Thinking I'll never get over you
I'll always be making a compromise no matter what I do, ooh
And maybe I'll never get over you

[Verse 2]
I've heard no one controls what happens in our lives
The universe gets to decide
Our future is written up there in the sky

[Chorus 2]
And I get so scared
Thinking I'll never get over you
Everything I've imagined
And none of our plans coming true

[Bridge]
I met someone new, and now I'm scared to go all the way
I hear you in my mind, and can't let go of what you used to say
I'm freakin', it's repeating when you said there'll never be a day
When letting go feels right, but for tonight we're trying anyway
You might also like[Chorus 3]
And I get so scared
Thinking they'll all be just like you
All the ways that you hurt me
And all of the shit you put me through

[Outro]
But maybe they'll all be just like you
Or maybe, theyâ€™ll never come close to you
So maybe, I'll never get over you
Maybe
