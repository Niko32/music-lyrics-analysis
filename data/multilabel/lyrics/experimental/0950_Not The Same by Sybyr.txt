Fuck do you expect me to do?
Fuck do you expect me to fuckin' do? ('Ringe)
You fuckin' dumbass
So dumb
So dumb, so dumb
So dumb, so dumb
So dumb, so dumb
Mm

[Verse]
Tired of the world shovin' shit in my face
Don't worry 'bout me, bitch, I been out of place
My own fuckin' brain complicated, a maze
I don't feel a lot of shit, sorry, we can't relate
I'm not fuckin' sorry, ANTI-WORLD all the way
Already had enough, daily, day after day
Everybody hate opinions so I throw some ya way
Only thing you do is bitch and moan and complain
Not everythin' is complicated
People simple to the point, I go ragin'
Every second I seem very outrageous
Feel like this area is full of cages
Can't do this, can't say that, fuck your rules, bitch
If I cared, I would sound like the new kid
Fuck your ears, I make anythin' destructive
Hence the reason why I'm lovin' this bullshit

No, we not the same, no, no, hell no
I don't even like you, I thought you knew
No, we not the same, no, no, hell no
I don't even like you, I thought you knew
No, we not the same, no, no, hell no
I don't even like you, I thought you knew
No, we not the same, no, no, hell no
I don't even like you, I thought you knew
