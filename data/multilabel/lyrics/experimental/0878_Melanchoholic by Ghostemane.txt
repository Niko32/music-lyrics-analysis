Today I found a way out of my bed, yet I'm still stuck inside my head
I grit my crooked teeth to everyone who looks at me, as if it means a thing
I must be too fucked up to notice, am I too fucked up to notice?
I'm too fucked up to notice, just how decomposed I am
I'm sick of all the ways I think about myself, the poster child for lack of mental health, I-
I think I deserve to be at peace, I think I deserve to be happy now, don't you think? I deserve to be...

[Interlude]
Is it time to go home yet? Is it time to go home?
Is it time to go home yet? When do I get to leave this place? When do I get to go home?
When do I get to leave this place? Is it time to go home yet?
When do I get to leave this place? Is it time to go home yet? Is it?
