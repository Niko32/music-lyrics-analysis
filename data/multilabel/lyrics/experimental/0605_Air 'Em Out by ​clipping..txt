(Ride on, ride on, ride on)
(Ride on, ride on, ride on)
(Ride on, ride on, ride on)
(Ride on, ride on, ride on)
(Ride on, ride on, ride on)
(Ride on, ride on, ride on)
(Ride on, ride on, ride on)
(Ride on, ride on)
Should've made the noose a little tighter
'Cause it ain't nobody dead—
Yeah

[Verse 1]
We who are about to bang them drums (Bang)
Beating on a dead body, riding shotgun (Ah)
Talking that shit, bitch, bite your tongue
See that ship over your city, better run (Run), run (Run)
Your war is like a board game where he come from
Already bored, claiming you're gang, "Pyong!" go the gun
Boy, he on some other shit, check your solar system, bitch
Don't let a motherfucker catch you sleeping at the wrong sun (Wrong sun)
Son a hater, send him into orbit
Higher than these motherfuckers claiming is they purpose
Turned and asked your partner why he started acting nervous
Rrr-r-rat! Keep talking, that's lip service
Rats! Decided it was time to hit the surface
Cats! Sleeping on it, write 'em off like cursive
Drown a fucking hater, his experience immersive
Now that he can feel it, call the doctors and the nurses up
You might also like[Chorus]
What you gon' do about it? Ain't nothing new about it
Should've made the noose a little tighter
'Cause it ain't nobody dead, just some muh'fuckin' riders
Air 'em out (Let 'em breathe), air 'em out (Got the fire!)
Air 'em out (Wanna see?), air 'em out (No!)
Should've made the noose a little tighter
'Cause it ain't nobody dead, just some muh'fuckin' riders

[Verse 2]
Try to play a killer soft like silk (Soft)
Ol' Frelk-ass gotta pay for the milk
Lies high off these lows when they step up in the party
Where they got up in they O's like some fucking Oankalis
So it's whips and chains (Chains), that's they game (Yup)
Like it was in bulk, back when a mack could slang
With his partners, tryna make his fucking name in the traps
All the way from Panshekara to the Kefahuchi tract (Pack)
Snatch a hoochie with a smile, tap her from the back
If somebody try to stop you, tell that dick to back-back
Back-back, back-back, stack racks, invisible
Five deep, strapped, hanging out a black dirigible
Playing shit is critical, masses massive
Masked mass murderer, mastiff
Barking at the moon that done been walked on, hit the kill switch
Your ass still moving backwards when they choke you with that real, trick!
[Chorus]
What you gon' do about it? Ain't nothing new about it
Should've made the noose a little tighter
'Cause it ain't nobody dead, just some muh'fuckin' riders
Air 'em out (Let 'em breathe), air 'em out (Got the fire!)
Air 'em out (Wanna see?), air 'em out (No!)
Should've made the noose a little tighter
'Cause it ain't nobody dead, just some muh'fuckin' riders

[Verse 3]
Come up off your smooth talk, playa, this raspy (Ahem)
You stuck on Morse code, playa, this ASCII
Your birthright make you scared to get nasty
The keyword is "Kemmer"—that's what your ass need (Yup)
Anybody bugging, get it in the mandible (Shit)
Got a problem, better hit 'em on they ansible
Ain't nobody flying just because they fly here
You could trip sets—real playas trip lightyears
Tightrope time, twinkletoes, and what?
Is you riding or not? E'erybody's hands up
Who they want? (Who they want?) Game over (Game over)
Old leech calling anyone who ain't sober
Old leaking-ass man in the corner
Talking that shit to the sky is a warning
You might wanna pay attention what he saying
'Cause the Ekumen ain't everything and these killers ain't playing, ho!
[Chorus]
What you gon' do about it? Ain't nothing new about it
Should've made the noose a little tighter
'Cause it ain't nobody dead, just some muh'fuckin' riders
Air 'em out (Let 'em breathe), air 'em out (Got the fire!)
Air 'em out (Wanna see?), air 'em out (No!)
Should've made the noose a little tighter
'Cause it ain't nobody dead, just some muh'fuckin' riders

[Outro]
(Ride on, ride on, ride on)
