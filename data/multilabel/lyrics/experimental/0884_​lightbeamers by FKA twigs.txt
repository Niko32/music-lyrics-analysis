Did you give yourself away again?
Don't, don't, don't do it again
Don't, don't do it again
Pretty and sad
Did you ever feel this way before? Again?
Don't, don't do it again
Don't, don't do it again

[Chorus]
This is for the hard dreamers
Been sad for a while
All the indigo and light-beamers
Been sad for a while

[Post-Chorus]
And you running from your life?
Beat down 'cause there ain't nobody on your side?
Tell yourself you love you so
Lay down your fears, baby, ain't nobody die from a no
And you running from your life?
Beat down 'cause there ain't nobody on your side?
Tell yourself you love you so
Lay down your fears, baby, ain't nobody die from a no

[Verse 2]
When it hurts you like this, again
Don't, don't do it again
Don't, don't do it again
Pretty and sad
Did you give yourself away again?
Don't, don't, don't do it again
Don't, don't do it again

I'll tеll you what you're gonna do for tonight
Make a list of the truth
Put down thе things that make you you
When you smile, does your tongue come through?
When you cry, do you feel brand new?
Put yourself in the room
You're so beautiful, you are the perfect view

[Bridge]
Put it in your phone, read it when you're down and out (Pretty and sad)
Put it in your phone, read it when you're down and out (Pretty and sad)
Put it in your phone, read it when you're down and out
(Do it again, do it again, do it again)
Play it in your car, boom a little loud (Pretty and sad)
Play it in your car, boom a little loud (Pretty and sad)
Play it in your car, boom a little loud (Do it again)

[Chorus]
This for the hard dreamers
Been sad for a while
All the indigo and light-beamers
Been sad for a while

[Post-Chorus]
And you running from your life?
Beat down 'cause there ain't nobody on your side?
Tell yourself you love you so
Lay down your fears, baby, ain't nobody die from a no
And you running from your life?
Beat down 'cause there ain't nobody on your side?
Tell yourself you love you so
Lay down your fears, baby, ain't nobody die from a no
[Outro]
Pretty and sad
