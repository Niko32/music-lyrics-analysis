Outside there's a boxcar waitin'
Outside the family stew
Out by the fire breathin'
Outside we wait 'til face turns blue
I know the nervous walkin'
I know the dirty beard hangs
Out by the boxcar waitin'
Take me away to nowhere plains

[Pre-Chorus: Black Francis, Kim Deal, both]
There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

[Chorus: Black Francis & Kim Deal]
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

[Verse 2: Black Francis]
Big shake on the boxcar movin'
Big shake to the land that's fallin' down
Is a wind makes a palm stop blowin'
A big, big stone fall and break my crown

[Pre-Chorus: Black Francis, Kim Deal, both]
There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man

[Bridge: Black Francis]
Ay-yeah
Ay-yeah
Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh

[Pre-Chorus: Black Francis, Kim Deal]
There is a wait so long (So long, so long)
You'll never wait so long

[Chorus: Black Francis and Kim Deal]
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
Here comes your man
