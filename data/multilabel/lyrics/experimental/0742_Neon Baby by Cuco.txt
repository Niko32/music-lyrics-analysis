Me and her till night
Look at my baby's shining eyes
Look at her highlight shining brighter than bright skies
Under common hopes
I hope you could get to know
The green lights showed the unknowns
So exploring we should go

[Chorus]
Notice maybe
Neon Baby
You could sway me
Being wavy
Neon City Baby [x2]
Maybe you could sway me [x2]
Neon baby in her neon city [x2]

[Verse 2]
I've been looking for you and your absence was made clear
I don't even know you but I know I want you here
Pink cars take us far
Just if you know who you are
Dressed up like a star
You were staying after dark
You might also like[Chorus] [x3]
Notice maybe
Neon Baby
You could sway me
Being wavy
Neon City Baby [x2]
Maybe you could sway me [x2]
