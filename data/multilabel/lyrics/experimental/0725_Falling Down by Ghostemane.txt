Hey you, where'd you go?
Your side of the bed has been getting cold
And I haven't slept since you left, at all
My signals been in and out
And I've been trying to figure out
If you ever tried to call

[Chorus]
I'm doubting myself, morbid and conscious
Of the way I felt when you drove off
And I hope you found a way to forgive yourself

[Verse 2]
You're on fire, invincible
You're on top of the end of the world
But so alone (So alone)
Now you're getting high and falling down
And you're looking hard all around
For a piece of mind

[Chorus]
I'm doubting myself, morbid and conscious
Of the way I felt when you drove off
And I hope you found a way to forgive yourself
You might also like[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
