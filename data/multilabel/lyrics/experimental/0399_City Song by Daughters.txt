This city is an empty glass
Words do nothing
No one sleeps
This city is an empty glass

[Verse 2]
This city is an empty glass
Graciousness is lost
The betrayed yearn
This city is an empty glass

[Verse 3]
This city is an empty glass
Shops are closed
There is nothing
This city is an empty glass

[Verse 4]
This city is an empty glass
The buildings shriek
As everything weeps
This city is an empty glass

[Verse 5]
The trees hang their heads
And the wired wants faith, fray
The songs sing silently
Oh
This city is an empty glass (Clouds)
This city is an empty glass (Clouds)

In the air: shrieks (In the air: shrieks)
The breath is long (The breath is long)
For the fires are out (For the fires are out)
The waters sit still (The waters sit still)
This city
This city is an empty glass
In the air: shrieks
The breath is long
And the fires are out
The waters sit still
