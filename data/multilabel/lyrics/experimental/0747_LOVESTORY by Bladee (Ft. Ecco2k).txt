Everything came back to me
Every path leads back to you again
Everything came back to me
Every path leads back to you again

[Verse 1: Bladee]
Perfect, you got perfect details
Like my skin, baby, perfect
Perfect details
Everyone thinks it's so special
And it feels like
And it feels like I'm in a love story
Just like in a love st—
It feels just like in a love story

[Chorus: Ecco2k]
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story

Make the city smell like perfume
Make the street smell like flowers
Make a moment
Everyone wants to be perfect
And it feels like, and it feels just like I've been daydreaming
Just like in a daydream
Feels just like I'm daydreaming
It feels like

[Refrain: Ecco2k]
Everything came back to me
Every path leads back to you again
Everything came back to me
Every path leads back to you again

[Chorus: Ecco2k]
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story
Just like in a love story
