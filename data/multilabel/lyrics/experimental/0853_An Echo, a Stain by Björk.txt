She touched my arm and smiled
One of these days, soon, very soon
Love you 'til then, love you 'til then
Feel my breath on your neck
And your heart will race

[Chorus 1]
Don't say no to me
You can't say no to me
I won't see you
Denied

[Bridge]
I'm sorry you saw that
I'm sorry he did it
An echo
A stain
A stain

[Chorus 2]
I can't say no to you
(I can't say no to you)
Say nothing

[Outro]
Free falling
