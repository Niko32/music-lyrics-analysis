Ask your heart (Please ask your heart)
Bring it back to where it was (Back where it was)
Ask your heart (Your heart, please ask your heart)
So, I'm back in your arms (Bring me back in your arms)

[Chorus]
Ask (Your heart, please ask your heart)
Won't you ask? (Your heart, please ask your heart)
Ask (Your heart, please ask your heart)
Won't you ask? (Would you ask, would you ask it?)

[Verse]
Whatever you ask of me (What you ask)
I'll let you have (My heart, please have my heart)
Every last drop of me
I'll let you have it (I'll let you have it)
Someone come break my fall
'Cause I'm fallin' hard (I fall so hard)
I'll pray to any god (Pray to God)
To create someone (To hold my heart)
It won't last (It won't last)
But I tried so hard (I tried, I tried)
It won't last (That long, won't last that long)
Or it won't happen at all
You might also like[Chorus]
Ask (To God, I pray to God)
Won't you ask? (Someone, create someone)
Ask (Someone to hold my heart)
Won't you ask? (Your heart, please ask your heart)

[Outro]
To hold my heart
To hold my heart
It stops and starts
It tears apart
And paints the walls
