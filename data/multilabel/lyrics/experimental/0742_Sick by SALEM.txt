Yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah

[Chorus: Heather Marlatt]
Six car pile up, just a mile up, up
Sick-sick, sick, sick-sick, sick, sick-sick, sick-sick-sick
Six car pile up, just a mile up, up
Sick-sick, sick, sick-sick, sick, sick-sick, sick-sick-sick

[Verse 1: Jack Donoghue]
Arms on me, drugs on me, y'all waiting tables
While I am so able that shit don't sound stable
My label; I call this shit, I'm gon' take over this
Defy, I warned you, bitch, I'll make your tummy sick
I'm on some evil shit, own this shit, scheme this shit
Demons speak to me so that's who I'm leaving with
If you can't feed a bitch then you don't need a bitch
I will slit your wrist, I will slit your wrist
Deep cry, little lamb I need you for tonight
Why not take a ride with me? Naw, that's the wrong seat
First I tie your hands and feet, shh, don't make a peep
From the trunk they ain't see, then we bounce and hit the beach

[Chorus: Heather Marlatt]
Six car pile up, just a mile up, up
Sick-sick, sick, sick-sick, sick, sick-sick, sick-sick-sick
Six car pile up, just a mile up, up
Sick-sick, sick, sick-sick, sick, sick-sick, sick-sick-sick
Six car pile up, just a mile up, up
Sick-sick, sick, sick-sick, sick, sick-sick, sick-sick-sick
Six car pile up, just a mile up, up
Sick-sick, sick, sick-sick, sick, sick-sick, sick-sick-sick

Cars in a circle, little lamb in the middle
All the head lights, so bright, he ain't cast a shadow, uh
Cars in a circle, little lamb in the middle
All the head lights, so bright, he ain't cast a shadow, uh

[Verse 2: Jack Donoghue]

I come in and lick it and this shit so vicious
You giving to hold it but nah, you don't need it
But give that shit more, bitch you get that from me
Bite my neck [?]
You need it, you know you 'bout to fall like Saint Peter
And when I grow old and shit, ya'll bloods still know this shit

I'm on some dope and some coke, with that dopin' shit
Give me some codeine, pass on me that Cobra, bitch
Evil 'round, close around, peepin' the door and shit
Lookin' for hope and, bitch, I am so over it

[Chorus: Heather Marlatt & Jack Donoghue]
