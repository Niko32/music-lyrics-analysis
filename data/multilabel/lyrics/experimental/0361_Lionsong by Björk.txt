Maybe he will come out of this
Maybe he won't
Somehow I'm not too bothered either way

[Chorus 1]
Maybe he will come out of this loving me
Maybe he will come out of this
I smell declarations of solitude
Maybe he will come out of this

[Verse 1]
Vietnam vet comes after the war
Lands in my house
This wild lion doesn't fit in this chair

[Chorus 2]
Maybe he will come out of this loving me
Maybe he won't
I'm not taming no animal
Maybe he will come out of this

[Verse 2]
Once it was simple
One feeling at a time
It reached its peak then transformed
These abstract complex feelings
I just don't know how to handle them
Should I throw oil on one of these moods
But which one?
The joy peak
Humor peak
Frustration peak
Anything peak
For clarity
You might also like[Chorus 2]
Maybe he will come out of this loving me
Maybe he won't
I'm not taming no animal
Maybe he will come out of this

[Bridge]
Maybe he will come out of this
Maybe he won't
Somehow I'm not too bothered either way
Somehow I'm not too bothered either way
I refuse, it's a sign of maturity
To be stuck in complexity
I demand all clarity

[Outro]
Maybe he will come out of this
Or he will feel solitaire
Somehow I'm not too bothered
I'd just like to know
