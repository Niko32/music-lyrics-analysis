Sometimes I shouldn't text you
You act just like my ex do
You know I try my best to catch you

[Pre-Chorus]
She wanna be so perfect, so it's silicone
For the last two years, I've been all alone
For my last few peers, I hope you fucking choke
I'm on the brink of insanity inside my own home

[Chorus]
I wanna slam my head against the wall 'til I cannot feel at all
She doesn't really like me, she likes alcohol
I watched my idols fall, I might just end it all
I wanna slam my head against the wall 'til I cannot feel at all
She doesn't really like me, she likes alcohol
I watched my idols fall, I might just еnd it all

[Verse]
Serotonin
I need you bad, you know it
I know you mad, I'm gloatin'
I know you mad
I know you mad (And I know)
You might also like[Refrain]
Sometimes I shouldn't tеxt you
You act just like my ex do
You know I try my best to catch you

[Pre-Chorus]
And he has a wife but he loves his mistress
Blink twice and you might just miss it
So much jealousy, it's vindictive
I'm worthless, a pot to piss in

[Chorus]
I wanna slam my head against the wall 'til I cannot feel at all
She doesn't really like me, she likes alcohol
I watched my idols fall, I might just end it all
I wanna slam my head against the wall 'til I cannot feel at all
She doesn't really like me, she likes alcohol
I watched my idols fall, I might just end it all
