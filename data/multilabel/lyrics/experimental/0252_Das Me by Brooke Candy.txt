Uh, yo, yo, what up? It’s Brooke Candy
Mother fucking freaky princess
Brooke “The Bratz Doll” Candy is the queen of Italy
Madame Candy if the price is right
Double D's, these are real titties
Lady T-H-C, Betty Blow
The hoodrat Drew Barrymore
I'm reppin' fag mob all day
Mother fucking faggots taking over the industry
Mother fucking faggots running the world, uh

[Verse 1]
I'm a super bitch, I fuck it up, I do this shit
You say that I'm a slut, It ain't your business who I'm fucking with
A dude could fuck 3 bitches and they'd say that he the man
But I get it in with twins, “she's a whore,” that's what they saying
It's time to take the word back, "slut" is now a compliment
A sexy-ass female who running shit and confident
Lady who on top of it, a female with a sex drive
Lyrically don't fuck with me, the greatest in the world live
Living on my pussy, all my ladies let me hear you
I'm a CEO, Dream girl, Drug Dealer
Real just like my titties you can even cop a feel-a
Finger licking good, treat my pussy like a meal-a
Talk about my tit size, I need to see your dick size
Show me what you're working with, I better win a big prize
Next time they call you a slut Brooke Candy tells you not to give a fuck
You might also like[Chorus]
All the dudes wiggle your dick for Brooke Candy
All the hoes jiggle your tits for Brooke Candy
If you gotta blunt, bitch, don't let it pass me
Looking for the realest bitch? Tell the world das me
Tell 'em dats me, tell 'em, tell 'em das me
Tell 'em dats me, tell 'em, tell 'em das me
Looking for the realest bitch? Tell the world das me
Tell 'em dats me, tell 'em, tell 'em das me

[Verse 2]
Uh, I'm coming back in
I could kill a bitch, man, I'm so fucking crazy
Gotta gun to your dome, foaming mouth rabies
Baby that's some real shit, I'm a Mob Boss
Take a knife to your dick, I'm a cut your fucking loss
Don’t say a word, put the money in the bag
I'm a tie you up bitch, yeah I like it when you gag
Don't try nothing funny, bitch, I came for the money
I'm a rascally rabbit, rap game Bugs Bunny
Trust no hoe, bitches out to get ya
Staring at me so hard, you need to take a picture
It'll last longer, you're so fucking late
It's easy for you talking shit from that far away
I'm on top of the world, I'm on top of the game
They gon’ show me respect, you best remember my name
Brooke Candy, the haters love to doubt me
Candy is my name but there's nothing sweet about me, uh
[Chorus]
All the dudes wiggle your dick for Brooke Candy
All the hoes jiggle your tits for Brooke Candy
If you gotta blunt, bitch, don't let it pass me
Looking for the realest bitch? Tell the world das me
Tell 'em dats me, tell 'em, tell 'em das me
Tell 'em dats me, tell 'em, tell 'em das me
Looking for the realest bitch? Tell the world das me
Tell 'em dats me, tell 'em, tell 'em das me

[Bridge]

Feel this shit, feel this shit
Gotta blunt, roll it up
Liquor store, hold it up
Uzi in my hand, bitch
Blow it up, blow it up

Tight twat, white hot
Feel this shit, feel this shit
Gotta blunt, roll it up
Liquor store, hold it up
Uzi in my hand, bitch
Blow it up, blow it up
[Chorus]
All the dudes wiggle your dick for Brooke Candy
All the hoes jiggle your tits for Brooke Candy
If you gotta blunt, bitch, don't let it pass me
Looking for the realest bitch? Tell the world das me
Tell 'em dats me, tell 'em, tell 'em das me
Tell 'em dats me, tell 'em, tell 'em das me
Looking for the realest bitch? Tell the world das me
Tell 'em dats me, tell 'em, tell 'em das me
All the dudes wiggle your dick for Brooke Candy
All the hoes jiggle your tits for Brooke Candy
If you gotta blunt, bitch, don't let it pass me
Looking for the realest bitch? Tell the world das me
Tell 'em dats me, tell 'em, tell 'em das me
Tell 'em dats me, tell 'em, tell 'em das me
Looking for the realest bitch? Tell the world das me
Tell 'em dats me, tell 'em, tell 'em das me

[Outro]
Yo, it's the freaky princess, you know that's me
No shame, ladies, no shame
