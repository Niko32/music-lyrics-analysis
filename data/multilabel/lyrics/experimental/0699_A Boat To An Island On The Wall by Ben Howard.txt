To care
Or not to care
To be there
In the distant and uncertain
To be aware
In an old Iberian hotel room
That the devil
Is not behind the curtain

[Verse 2]
She said walk in small steps
And fear floating
We made a pact
As Saturn approaching
Leaned on the sky
And smoking a cigarette
Said it's late
You should be going
The wind is howling
The house is showing
(High numbers)

[Chorus]
Boat to an island on the wall
Hand striking in slow motion
Future singing in a field
Shooting season's open
You might also like[Verse 3]
To care
Or not to care
To be aware
In your absence, they made your choices for you
You were supposed to laugh
Said the fortune to his sailor
This is the black mountain path
Or these are the sunny shores to nowhere
Well

[Chorus]
Boat to an island on the wall
A hand striking in slow motion
Future singing in a field
Shooting season's open

[Chorus]
Boat to an island on the wall
A hand striking in slow motion
That's it, that's it all
Shooting season's open
