[Gibberish]

[Verse 1]
My healed chest wound
Transformed into a gate
Where I receive love from
Where I give love from

[Chorus 1]
And I care for you, care for you
I care for you, care for you
Care for you, care for you
I care for you, care for you

[Verse 2]
Split into many parts
Splattered light beams into prisms
That will reunite

[Chorus 2]
If you care for me, care for me
If you care for me, care for me
Care for me, care for me
And then I'll care for you, care for you
I care for you, care for you
I care for you, care for you
Care for you, care for you

Didn't used to be so needy
Just more broken than normal
Proud self-sufficiency
My silhouette is oval
It is a gate

[Chorus 3]
I can care for you, care for you from
I can care for you, care for you
I care for you, care for you
I care for you, care for you
I care for you, care for you
You care for me, care for me
Care for you
