Let me live
Through your vice
Mass appeal
I feel in ten breaths it's a miracle if we're still alive
Can you touch it? Is it real?
Paper cut it, I feel
The slightest rip is a river that's overflowing me

[Verse 2]
Something happened, just above me
I've a baby inside
But I won't give birth till you insert yourself inside of me
I hear you whining, baby lively
I am an angel (Hush now)
My back wings give the hardest slap that you've ever seen

[Bridge]
Figures of eight around your face (Hush now, hush now)
Elaborate, your eternity
You're so fucking fake that itâ€™s hurting me
I'm just jealous 'cause you're more alive than what I'll ever be
I take a step, I break my neck
Teach me how to lead with my middle finger (Hush now, hush now)
Boys growing, boys growing girls into women
Teach me how to live life like I'm not a singer
Three-three-three-three-three-three, hold that pose for me
(Hush now, hush now)

Let me live
Let me live
Let me
Hush now
