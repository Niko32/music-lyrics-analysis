Drain Gang, man
That's the word to CEO, man
Legendary Drain member, man
Stop signs and red lights
Drain Gang, man
Drain Gang

[Chorus]
Flash from a clear sky, let the fear fly
House party nearby, I'm bringing weird guys
I need some wet wipes and some Clear eyes
Stop signs and red lights outside Best Buy
Hit with the Maglite in my head twice
Hit the plug for the drugs, ain't tryna live a long life
I was born with the bad luck, I don't ask why
You don't want to see me out, that's a bad sign

[Verse]
I'm in London, I pass by on the Gray Line
In the cut, going snowblind under red skies
Give a fuck 'bout the next guy, might as well die
I won't fuck with you girl, bye, you're not my type
See my bros get a hundred thousand, I might cry
Might pull up in a Lexus but I can't drive
They say I won't make it but I might try
Need a glove on my hand if we gonna do a high-five
Glove on my hand if we gonna do a high-five
That's a goodnight
You might also like[Chorus]
Flash-Flash-Flash from a clear sky, let the fear fly
House party nearby, I'm bringing weird guys
I need some wet wipes and some Clear eyes
Stop signs and red lights, outside Best Buy
Hit with the Maglite in my head twice
Hit the plug for the drugs, ain't tryna live a long life
I was born with the bad luck, I don't ask why
You don't want to see me out, that's a bad sign
