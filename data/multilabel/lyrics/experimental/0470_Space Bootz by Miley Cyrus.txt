Sitting here with nothing to say
Looking out the window, it just rained, but the sun's up for the day
And there's probably a rainbow, but I don't care
'Cause all the colors left with you
Thinking 'bout driving around in your car
I never thought that we would take it very far
I just love talking and then parking
Then we'd go walking, I loved you so much
I just started watching TV
I get so high 'cause you're not here smoking my weed
And I get so bored
'Cause you're not here to make me laugh

[Interlude]
You're so cute in your space suit
In your space boots, space dude

[Verse 2]
Since you left, I started to drink
'Cause sometimes, now, when I do drugs, I'll start to overthink
Then I start crying, I think I'm dying
But I'm just tripping, start spiraling down this hole

[Chorus]
Oh, space dude in your space boots
I gotta be high to deal with your moods
But maybe it's me, I gotta change my view
Oh, space dude in your space suit
Our love, it takes us to the moon
But you leave me up there, I'm so marooned
Oh, space dude in your space boots
And your space suit, space dude
Space dude in your space boots
And your space suit, space dude
You might also like[Verse 3]
Every time we talk, I feel like shit
I guess I was just tryin' to avoid letting myself feel like this
'Cause it makes me feel like I might die
But every second, I'm doing that anyway
My biggest fear was not being with you
The pain seems so excruciating, I don't know what I'd do
We're both vegan, it makes it easy
To think you'd never hurt anything living intentionally

[Chorus]
Oh, space dude in your space boots
I gotta be high to deal with your moods
But maybe it's me, I gotta change my view
Oh, space dude in your space suit
Our love, it takes us to the moon
But you leave me up there, I'm so marooned
Oh, space dude
Oh, space dude
