So cold

[Verse 1]
This place, this late, take me on a ride, yeah
What I'd do for ya, uh, what I'd do for ya (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
Live fast, die young, glad you're here tonight
Yeah, what I'd do for ya
Yeah, what I'd do for ya
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know me all too well
I'm not one to be afraid
Not one to go and give it up 'fore you put it down

[Chorus]
You should pull me up closer
Turn the heat up in your Rover
Why don't you take it out on me?
If you think you're so cold, brrr
You should pull me up closer
Get your rocket outta holster
Why don't you take it out on me?
If you think you're so cold, brrr

You can come and get it, have your way
When you say it, say it, say it with a little attitude
I can take it, take it, take it just to what you gotta do, yeah
Oh, what I'd do for you

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't know me all too well
I'm not one to be afraid
Not one to go and give it up 'fore you put it down

[Chorus]
You should pull me up closer (You should pull me up close)
Turn the heat up in your Rover (Oh)
Why don't you take it out on me?
If you think you're so cold, brrr
You should pull me up closer (Closer)
Get your rocket outta holster (Oh)
Why don't you take it out on me?
If you think you're so cold, brrr

[Outro]
Brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr, brrr
