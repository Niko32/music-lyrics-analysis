Hmm-mm-mm-mm
Excuse me, my voice is a little raspy
Yo bitch like it though, huh, huh, yuh!

[Chorus]
5k, no, 10k, what I made today (Okay, okay)
Bitch, I'm from the South (Drop top)
Tell a nigga, bitch, come run my fade (From my South)
Slide straight to your crib, just like Chucky
Bitch, come out n' play (Bitch, come out)
Bitch, come out n' play (Bitch, come out)
Bitch, come out n' play (Ayy, ayy)
5k, 10k, what I made today
Bitch, I'm from the South
Tell a nigga, bitch come run my fade (Water)
Slide straight to your crib, just like Chucky
Bitch, come out n' play, yuh
Bitch, come out n' play, yuh
Bitch, come out n' play, ayy

[Verse]
Demolition on these bitches, I'm gon' break her walls
I call myself Sharkboy, eat these niggas like it's Jaws
Pussy, keep my foot up on they neck and hurt they jaw, uh
Kingdom Hearts is what I are
My keyblade swing like Ars
Out of the darkness, bitch, inside my heart and shit
So just like a carcass in the wilderness, you little bitch
Or maybe just at me (Maybe)
Heard you that nigga, heard you just might be
They say that my flow is scary 'n' frightening (They say)
Because it strike hard like some lightning (Water)
I just might pick up the pieces just like I'm Poseidon
Like bitches, you ride it 'cause we never hide it
And I know the prophecy just like the Mayans, bitch (I-I-I know)
I know your girl everywhere, she still get me excited (Yup)
I'm not like Al-Qaeda, bitch, more like a viking (Yup, yup)
And in your bitch, we could get very violent (Bitch, stay off)

5k, no, 10k, what I made today (Okay, okay)
Bitch, I'm from the South (Drop top)
Tell a nigga, bitch, come run my fade (From my South)
Slide straight to your crib, just like Chucky
Bitch, come out n' play (Bitch, come out)
Bitch, come out n' play (Bitch, come out)
Bitch, come out n' play (Ayy, ayy)
5k, 10k, what I made today
Bitch, I'm from the South
Tell a nigga, bitch, come run my fade (Water)
Slide straight to your crib, just like Chucky
Bitch, come out n' play, yo
Bitch, come out n' play, yo
Bitch, come out n' play, ayy
