Shawty, you know what it do
Wrist laser when I come through
I'm finna take off to the moon
I fly up like a balloon
All white linen, painted true
Shawty, you know what it do
Smokin' double, give me two
Shawty, you know what it do

[Verse]
I don't give no fucks 'bout you
I take it all, can never lose
Only myself and my truth
Lovin' this shit since I was two
Got helicopters on my roof
I'm out here far away from you
Sad Mobb, we don't fuck with fools
I'm in the zone, sippin' Grey Goose
Double G's on my shoe, G's on my shoes

[Chorus]
Shawty, you know what it do
Wrist laser when I come through
I'm finna take off to the moon
I fly up like a balloon
All white linen, painted true
Shawty, you know what it doYou might also like
