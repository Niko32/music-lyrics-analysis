I wanna churn like Amish butter
I wanna move out of your way
I wanna find what's there in your stomach
If it's the same dark and it's too late

[Chorus]
What if it's the same dark coming?
The same dark
What if it's the same dark coming?
The same dark
Oh, fuck it all then

[Verse 2]
I spent the summer trying to be sweeter
I spent the summer staying in
I ran a mile and then another
Spent my nights by hospital beds

[Chorus]
What if it's the same dark coming?
The same dark
What if it's the same dark coming?
The same dark
Well then, fuck it all
Fuck it allYou might also like
