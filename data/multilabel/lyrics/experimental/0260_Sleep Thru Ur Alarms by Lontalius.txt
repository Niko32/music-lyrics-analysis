Thoughts that go like bullets through you
The time you told me that you wished you were dead
What's a broken arm when you can't stop choosing
To sleep through your alarms, man, you're losing your head

[Chorus]
(But I guess I'll go home and dream instead)
The thoughts that go like bullets through you
The time you told me that you wished you were dead
(But I guess I'll go home and dream instead)
What's a broken arm when you can't stop choosing
To sleep through your alarms, man, you're losing your headYou might also like
