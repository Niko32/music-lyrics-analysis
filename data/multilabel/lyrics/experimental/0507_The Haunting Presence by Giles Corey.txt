Giles Corey, bloody and gory
We will redress your wrongs
Bloody and battered, nothing matters
Somehow, just makes it worse
And I don't care if I live or die
Because I ain't ever going to no other side
There ain't no heaven and there ain't no hell
But I am a sinner so it's all just as well

[Refrain]
There's a devil on my back
There's a devil on my legs
There's a devil on my chest
There's a devil on my neck
There's a devil on my back
There's a devil on my legs
There's a devil on my chest
There's a devil on my neck
There's a devil on my back

[Bridge]
And of a wicked physick came
All the heavy stones
To fall with crushing weight upon
All of those who can't become a ghost
And of a wicked physick came
All the heavy stones
To fall with a heavy weight upon
Those who cannot become a ghost

I've been wailing like a child at the bottom of a well
I've been pacing like a man in a prison cell (I wanna die!)
I am buried above the ground
And no-one knows anything
(There's a devil on my chest)
[Incomprehensible yelling]
Fuck!
Fuck!
