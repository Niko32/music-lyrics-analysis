Woo

[Verse]
If you think I'm stupid now, you should see me when I'm high
And I'm smarter than I look, I'm the dumbest girl alive
I took ten Advils today, I've got bruises on my thighs
Plus I gave away my brain, I'm the dumbest girl alive
I've got lightning in my veins, walk around like Frankenstein
I did science on my face, I'm the dumbest girl alive
Never ask me what I think, don't know why you even try
'Cause I always get it wrong, I'm the dumbest girl alive
Money comin' from my mouth, money comin' from my eyes
And I keep on losing count, I'm the dumbest girl alive
And I'm picking up the pacе, I'm so happy, I could die
Put emojis on my grave, I'm thе dumbest girl alive
And I feel so dangerous, but you say I'm doin' fine now
Guess that's how it goes, I'm the dumbest girl alive
Text, text, text, text, like you're tryna start a fight
Yeah, I'll fuckin' text you back, I'm the dumbest girl alive

[Outro]
Why you wanna pout?
Is there something in your eye?
Can you show me how?
Can you show me how to
