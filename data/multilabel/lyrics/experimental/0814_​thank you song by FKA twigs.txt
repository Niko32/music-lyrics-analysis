I wanted to die, I'm just being honest
No longer afraid to say it out loud
So, I put my ear on your chest till I hear the answer
Love in motion seems to save me now

[Chorus]
Love in motion, my heart's open
Thank you, thank you, I'm okay
'Cause you care, I made it through today

[Verse 2]
I once had a dream that shadows took over
(Tears were fallin' like rain)
I must've cried out 'cause you were awake
(You're the only one who really cares what I say)
You turned on the light as you pulled me closer
(All I know is that no one loves me like you)
Love in motion seems to save me now

[Chorus]
Love in motion, my heart's open
Thank you, thank you, I'm okay
'Cause you care, I made it through today

[Bridge]
(Like you, like)
No one loves me like you (Like)
(Like) No-no-no-no (You)
No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no, (Like) no-no-no-no (You)
No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no, no
You might also like[Chorus]
Love in motion, my heart's open
Thank you, thank you, I'm okay
'Cause you care, I made it through today

[Outro]
No-no-no-no
No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no
No-no-no-no, no-no-no-no-no
