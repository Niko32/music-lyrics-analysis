Try to take my swag, I will try to take your life
If you fuck around with Bladee, I will turn into a knife
I see your secrets, I am on you like the wind
There's too much evil, I let everything begin
Suicide doors, Lamborghini, Porsche, no skateboard
We don't play war, no fake swords
I got seal sewers, put them to your sword
Make you feel the real force
I got no remorse, driving foreign vehicles
Pink walls, waterguns, drink those
I turn your whole life to a sinkhole
Fold up clothes, got new clothes
No new friends in my new phone

[Chorus]
I was on so many, so many drugs
Because I don't know what it's like to be loved
I was on so many, so many drugs
Because I don't know what it's like to be loved
Like to be loved
Like to be loved
Like to be loved
What it's like to be loved
Like to be loved
Like to be loved
Because I don't know what it's like to be loved
Like to be loved

Inhale fairytale, realisation
Dream life over real life, I ain't waiting
You're amazing, outside and it's raining
Money is the only thing I'm making, I hate it

[Chorus]
I was on so many, so many drugs
Because I don't know what it's like to be loved
I was on so many, so many drugs
Because I don't know what it's like to be loved
Like to be loved
Like to be loved
Like to be loved
What it's like to be loved
Like to be loved
Like to be loved
Because I don't know what it's like to be loved
Like to be loved

[Verse 3]
Easy to forget, I was Jesus on her neck
I'm uneasy when I rest, I don't know what happens next
I drink Fiji when I text, how to put this through your vest?
All these faces make me stressed, Bladeecity, you're a guest
Black city, I'm a ghost
Have you ever felt the cold?
I can see you try to go
But I know you know I know
I wear new, I see that's old
I have everything you own
I am bound to be alone
Blood magic in my stones
