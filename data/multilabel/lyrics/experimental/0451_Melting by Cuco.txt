You are my church, you are my place of worship
I heard you're the plug, can I be the circuit?
When I got court, I hope that you're the verdict
When you're around, my insides turn inverted
My blood starts to rush when I see you, darling
I know you're nearby and I know your purpose
Take one look at you, you're heavens incarnate
What is this spell, baby? Please show some mercy

[Chorus]
Melting like an ice cream
When you smile
Melting, you're a daydream
Stay a while

[Verse 2]
I pray that I can learn to be funny
I'm watching every stand-up comedy
Just hoping that you will rub off on me
So you'll smile at everything I say
You got some soft lips and some pearly whites (Pearly whites)
I wanna touch them at the dead of night (Dead of night)
Your smile ignites just like a candlelight (Candlelight)
Then somehow I know everything's alright
You might also like[Chorus]
Melting like an ice cream
When you smile
Melting, you're a daydream
Stay a while

[Instrumental Outro]
