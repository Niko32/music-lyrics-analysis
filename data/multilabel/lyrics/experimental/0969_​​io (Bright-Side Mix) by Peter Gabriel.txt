I'm just a part of everything
I stand on two legs and I learned to sing
It's not what was said and it's not what I heard
I walk with my dog and I whistle with the bird
Stuff coming out, stuff going in
I'm just a part of everything
Stuff coming out, stuff going in
I'm just a part of everything

[Verse 2]
So we think we really live apart
Because we got two legs, a brain and a heart
We all belong to everything
To the octopus' suckers and the buzzard’s wing
To the elephant’s trunk and the buzzing bees’ sting
Stuff coming out, stuff going in
I'm just a part of everything
I'm just a part of everything

[Chorus]
​​i/o, i/o
I'm coming out, I'm going in
​​i/o, i/o
I'm just a part of everything
You might also like[Verse 3]
I learn like a baby, I learn like a seed
Spread out my tubers wherever I need
I find any way to attach and connect
And I run like water, no cause or effect
I got stuff coming out, stuff going in
I'm just a part of everything
Stuff coming out, stuff going in
I'm just a part of everything

[Verse 4]
When the panting is over and the warmth has run out
Love will be flowing, I have no doubt
With the vehicle in neutral and the ground to be faced
I’ll be all laid to rest in my proper place
Into the roots of an old oak tree
Where life can move freely in and out of me
I'll have stuff coming out and stuff going in
I'm just a part of everything

[Chorus]
​​i/o, i/o
I'm coming out, I'm going in
​​i/o, i/o
I'm just a part of everything
[Chorus]
​​i/o, i/o
I'm coming out, I'm going in
​​i/o, i/o
I'm just a part of everything
