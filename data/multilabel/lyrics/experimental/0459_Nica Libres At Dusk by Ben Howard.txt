Door is locked, my gums are bleeding
Outside she reads, outside she is reading
The evacuation procedure
Out loud

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Clothes are off, my health receding
Somewhere she dreams, somewhere she is dreaming
Of Caribbean Nica Libres
At dusk

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
While the faithful dispose of a generation
And all of the mountains whisper knowingly
I order a colada and sit to count my dollars
And watch eagles soar in circles
Perpetually

[Instrumental]

[Verse 3]
Door is locked, my gums are bleeding
Outside she reads, outside she is reading
The evacuation procedure

[Verse 4]
Out loud
Clothes are off, my health receding
Somewhere she dreams, somewhere she is dreaming
Of Caribbean Nica Libres
At dusk

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
While the faithful dispose of a generation
And all of the mountains rumble knowingly
I order a colada and sit to count my dollars
And watch eagles soar in circles
Perpetually

[Bridge]
Forever, forever
Such a beautiful thing

[Chorus]
Now I am older, I don't look over my shoulder
I know what is there in front of me
Ten Marlboro cigarettes
The rolled the butts into the bottle tops
Today I will stare at the sea
'Til my eyes have had enough
[Instrumental]

[Outro]
Enough, enough
Is that enough?

[Instrumental]
