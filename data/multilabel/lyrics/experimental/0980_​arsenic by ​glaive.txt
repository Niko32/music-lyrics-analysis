One, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Ayy, and I hold my breath
Ayy, so I hold my breath
And I don't wanna be here
Ayy, ayy, I don't wanna
I don't wanna be here, I want to hide away
And like, I'm not even nervous I could die today
Or like I could disappear, won't happen either way
And there's this girl named Astrid with a time and date

[Chorus]
So I hold my breath 'til my lungs collapse
And I bleach my teeth so I can smile and laugh
And she's like Artemis with arsenic inside of her bag
And he's a narcissist, but part of him really miss his past
And I hold my breath 'til my lungs collapse
And I bleach my teeth so I can smile and laugh
And she's like Artemis with arsenic inside of her bag
And he's a narcissist, but part of him really miss his past

[Verse 2]
And there's this rich white girl that works inside a department store
Guess that she ain't rich no more, her mom and dad got a divorce
She say that she's fine, she sits alone and cries to Paramore
And if I'm being honest with the process, I don't care no more
And the trees don't grow where the sun is low
Let me tell you a lil' story 'bout where we don't go
And there's this forest on the eastside where all the evil beasts lie
And I cannot deny that my brain buzzin' like a beehive
And move out to the seaside, oh my God, it must be nice
And I met this girl named Persephone, I think she'll be mine
You might also like[Chorus]
And I hold my breath 'til my lungs collapse
And I bleach my teeth so I can smile and laugh
And she's like Artemis with arsenic inside of her bag
And he's a narcissist, but part of him really miss his past
And I hold my breath 'til my lungs collapse
And I bleach my teeth so I can smile and laugh
And she's like Artemis with arsenic inside of her bag
And he's a narcissist, but part of him really miss his past
