I'd weigh a million pounds if you were gravity
I'd take a billion pills if it gave me sanity
Time has passed me by
Shred my grief with vice
For granted taken eyes
We appeared underneath the light

[Chorus]
The flaws that perfect us
And all the affections
As they infect us, love couldn't help us
Ooh, you crawl underneath me

[Verse 2]
I'd die a million deaths, and you'd resurrect me
I'd fall a billion times, but you wouldn't let me
You wouldn't let me

[Chorus]
The flaws that perfect us
And all the affections
As they infect us, love couldn't help us
Where would I go?
Where would I go?
Where would I go?
Where would I go?You might also like
