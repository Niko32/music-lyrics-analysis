You're up in my mind, you're all I can see
Looking at you looking back at me
With you, I feel something real true
Talking about what I'm gonna do to you
You don't give a fuck when I'm drunk like a skunk
Always thumbs up, never putting me on the gronk
But I'll tell you something that I think is true

[Chorus]
I think you're real cool, yeah-hey
I think you're real cool
Oh, come for a swim in my pool
I think you're real cool

[Verse 2]
Let the Cavalier Tung kiss ya, it's the Mista Tung Twista
Pumpin' a rhythm, a lyrical styler
Tongue'll be flingin' a funky pile o'
The lyrical rhymes that's breakin' 'em off in the mind
Oh, like petroleum
Kicking about the run will make 'em sweat like petroleum
Oh, slowly I'm
It's the rhythm, a lyrical texture
I'm above her, you can never get next to her, next to her
I think you're real
You might also like[Chorus]
Yeah, see, I think you're real cool
I think you're real cool
Oh, come for a swim in my pool, yeah-hey
I think you're real cool, yeah, yeah

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
I think you're real cool, yeah-hey
I think you're real cool
Oh, come for a swim in my pool
I think you're real cool
