You'll be in the air
In some hours you'll be over the sea
Lost in the other passengers on the plane
But if you just moved your arms

[Verse 2]
Then you could tell that you are in the air
You'd feel the yawning gulf grow wider
And you'd feel the dwindling fuel for your lungs
And your breaths would slow

[Verse 3]
You'd be in the air
You'd feel the hot blowing rock filled winds
And the clouds of ash would fill your skies
And you smoothly glide

[Bridge]
Over the cold river basin where we spend the night
And again, your gaping gap is pink in foggy light
When I wake up, your pet will pounce on me, I'll meet the day
You'll be in the air, I'll be in your bed when I'm awake

[Verse 4]
And can you tell that I'm down here?
Can you feel my hot lungy wind?
Was it intense to smell my skin
And not lose yourself?

I'll look pinkly out your window in the fog
And loud and clearly, I'll pick out your resounding roar
You'll be in the air
You'll bear fruit, your bare feet
Your bare arms in the heat
You'll be able to feel your might
