Guess it's Mecha on the beat
Drama, drama, baby

[Chorus: Bladee]
Drama, baby, drama, baby
Ooh, let you do what you do (With your attitude)
Drama, drama, drama, baby
Ooh, let you do what you do, what you do
All summer baby, ooh, all night, all night
Who could save me? Maybe you, yeah, you, yeah, you
Be like water, flow through, flow through into white
Drama, baby, drama, baby, ooh, let you do what you do
All summer baby, ooh, all night, all night

[Verse: Bladee]
Drama baby, ooh, let you do what you do, what you do
Who could save me? Maybe you, yeah, you, yeah, you
When the bells of glory toll, come home, inside
Be like water, flow through, flow through into white

[Bridge: Bladee]
Drama, baby, ooh, let you do what you do, what you do, what you do
(Drama, drama, baby)
Who could save me? Maybe you, yeah, you, yeah, you
You might also like[Chorus: Bladee]
Drama, baby, drama, baby
Ooh, let you do what you do (With your attitude)
Drama, drama, drama, baby
Ooh, let you do what you do, what you do
All summer baby, ooh, all night, all night
Who could save me? Maybe you, yeah, you, yeah, you
Be like water, flow through, flow through into white
Drama, baby, drama, baby, ooh, let you do what you do
All summer baby, ooh, all night
