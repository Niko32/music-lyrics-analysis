Well, I won't die for love
But I've got a body here to bury
And if truth be told, it's scary
'Cause my shoulders are heavy already
And, yeah, I know
The parts of myself that I've hated
And I can't tell which ones are mine
And which I created

[Chorus]
But I won't die for love
But ever since I met you
You could have my heart
And I would break it for you
And I won't die for love
But ever since I met you
You could have my heart
And I would break it for you

[Verse 2]
Take onе in the temple, my tonguе is a vessel
I try to be careful with the thing inside my chest
You shoot for the memory so you can forget me
I'll leave if you let me, ooh
You might also like[Chorus]
But I won't die for love
But ever since I met you
You could have my heart
And I would break it for you

[Bridge]
Please don't leave (I'm runnin' out of time to tell you)
Don't leave me in the shape you left me (I'm runnin' out of things that I regret)
Please don't leave (I'm runnin' out of time to tell you)
Don't leave me in the shape you left me (I'm runnin' out of things that I regret)
Please don't leave (I won't ever)
Don't leave me in the shape you left me (You told me)
Please don't leave (Forever)
Just leave me in the place you found me safe and soundly

[Chorus]
I won't die for love
But ever since I met you
You could have my heart
And I would break it for you

[Outro]
Well, I won't die for love
But ever since I met you
You could have my heart
And I would break it for you
