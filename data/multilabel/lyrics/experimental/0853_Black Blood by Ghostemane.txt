I think I was born in the wrong generation
Nobody talks to me, nobody is relating
Am I so invisible, or am I so hated?
We swing our fists and kick our legs to know we're still breathin'
I know what it's like when you're all alone
Just look in my eyes, we are so alike

[Chorus]
Black blood
Black blood

[Verse 2]
They won't drag me to the ground
Up against the world
Fucked at birth
What's a life worth?

[Chorus]
Black blood

[Refrain]
You can kill me, but I'll never fucking die

[Interlude]
