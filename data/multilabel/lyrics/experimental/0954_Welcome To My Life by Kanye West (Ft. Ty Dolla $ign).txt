I know I can beat her
You know—
Very confident
I'm very confident
You say it so easily, why?
Cause I believe it
What she said, she said it with so much confidence the first time
But you keep going on and on...
But we can't keep interrupting, I mean, if you want—
You've got to understand that you're dealing with a image of a 14-year-old child
And this child gonna be out there playing when your old ass and me gonna be in the grave
When she say something, we done told you what's happening
You're dealing with a little black kid, and let her be a kid
She answered it with a lot of confidence
Leave that alone

[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign]
Watching the people, don't know what to do
Wonder where we go, from here
You had some questions, make some suggestions
One day you'll realize, what's real

[Refrain: Ty Dolla $ign]
So, keep on, don't let up, keep on you better
Keep up keep coming to keep up with my life

Watchin’ who you know, watch for the psuedos
Watchin’ what you're doin'
Welcome to my life
Welcome to my—

[Verse 1: Kanye West]
What it mean to be black now?
Who got the culture on they back now?
Ooh, he about to hit him with that grrah now
And if I tell her bring it over, she coming right now (Rah!)
Ooh, they about to black out
Soon as we bring up quantum black on blacks out
Couldn't afford a polo, that was facts now
Remember when the credit card maxed out?
PJ choppy, but I know God got me
Living room got nothing, you ain't heard of Wabi Sabi?
Used to be a miracle to have a Murakami
Now going dummy like Cole told Tommy
They tried to lie about the money
Prescribed drugs to numb me
Set the bar low, I moved the goal post sunday
Now we're taking off on a Gold Coast Runway (Blat!)
You weren't in Japan with Tadao Ando
You ain't finished "Runaway" at George Condo's condo
We set the whole world on a whirlwind
Remember I found out my assistant was both me and Virgil's girlfriend
[Chorus: Ty Dolla $ign & Kanye West]
Watching the people, don't know what to do
Wonder where we go, from here
You had some questions, made some suggestions
One day you'll realize, what's real
(Blat!)

[Verse 2: Ty Dolla $ign]
Can't take the pressure
I want to know who's in for the long road
Helpless a neighbor, goin' after Jamal
Came at the wrong time
Hey, yeah, yeah
They laughed at my statements, put debt on my payments
Now this is all mine

[Refrain: Ty Dolla $ign]
So, keep on, don't let up, keep on, you better
Keep up, keep coming to keep up with my life

[Outro: Kanye West]
Welcome to my life
