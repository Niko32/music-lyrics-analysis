There's something cold and blank
Behind her smile
She's standing on an overpass
In her miracle mile

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away, today
Today, to run away

[Chorus]
A pill to make you numb, a pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself

[Verse 2]
Her mouth was an empty cut
And she was waiting to fall
Just bleeding like a polaroid
That lost all her dolls

[Pre-Chorus]
You were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away, today
Today, to run away
You might also like[Chorus]
A pill to make you numb, a pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself
A pill to make you numb, a pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself

[Bridge]
You were from a perfect world
A world that threw me away, today

[Chorus]
A pill to make you numb, a pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself
A pill to make you numb, a pill to make you dumb
A pill to make you anybody else
But all the drugs in this world
Won't save her from herself
