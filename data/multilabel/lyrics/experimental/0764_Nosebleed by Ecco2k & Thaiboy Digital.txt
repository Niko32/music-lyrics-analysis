How she got me fallin'
How she got me fallin'
How she got me fallin'
How she got me fallin'

[Chorus: Thaiboy Digital]
How she got me fallin'
I shouldn't have went all in
She got me all bawlin'
She got me all ballin'
On my phone, she callin'
On my phone, she callin'
How she got me fallin'
How she got me fallin'

[Verse 1: Thaiboy Digital]
Shawty, she a baddie and her body tastes like candy
Thaiboy not her daddy but for shawty, I'ma spend it
Shawty, I'ma spend it
If you want one, I'ma give you ten, ten
Thaiboy never mad, I just wanna win
She would never be sad, she just like to chill
She and me, we racing for a mil'
She and me, we pull up for the kill
Shawty is my bae, she keep it real
She driving me so crazy, but it's chill, chill
Just one look, and she know how I feel
That's how I know that this shit is real
That's how I know that this shit is real

Make a call to Thaiboy Goon, let's reunite
Drinking Smirnoff Ice, pour pollution in the clean Sprite
Nissan GT-R standing at a green light
In the sky, now I'm feeling like a G5
You remind me of someone, it doesn't feel right
Stainless steel knife, show you what it feels like
No sleep, two keys made my nose bleed
Lately I've been feeling ghostly
And I can't believe in anything you've told me
You don't know me, why you tryna hold me?
Silver charms around my throat so I'm choking
Blood is on me, hope nobody noticed

[Chorus: Thaiboy Digital]
How she got me fallin'
I shouldn't have went all in
She got me all bawlin'
She got me all ballin'
On my phone, she callin'
On my phone, she callin'
How she got me fallin'
How she got me fallin'
