Eve, I never thought it would get like this

[Verse: Willow & Jaden]
He lost his way and found it in the dark
(If you come close, you'll learn we might not survive the night)
The gold and diamonds, creators of his pride
(Don't think, don't act, boy, I gave you this side of life)
They warned him, "One day you might lose your spark"
(If you come close, you'll learn we might not survive the night)
They made us walk right out of Eden's gate
No, no, no we can't go home, so we gon' walk down this lonely road
Lonely road, walk down this lonely road
When I saw Eve looking up at that tree
I told her, "No, he'll teach us how to think"
(I used to love you)
He took his glass and filled it with the sea
(Ohh, with diamonds dancing on a hill)
I had one drink and everything turned pink
(I had one drink and everything turned pink)

[Bridge: Willow]
We were running through the stars
We were sitting in the garden
Bathe in the Euphrates, back to where we started
My heart fluttering for you, with no remedy
It's all pulling on my body like it's meant to be
You're my muse, watch all your moves
(I gotta see it through)
It's me and you

Hear my voice, it's unprescribed
I can't describe your units
He took his glass and filled it with the sea
(With his diamonds dancing on a hill)
I had one drink and everything turned pink
