I notice everything
But lack the voice to tell you what I see
This permamute is driving me crazy
You'd fall for anything
A place to sleep, a home to call your own
When you're up all night
You repeat on the phone

[Chorus:]
Let's get away
Drive out in the rain
Let's get away
Climb inside my brain

[Verse 2:]
You say you'll never sing
Punishing the one who made you whole
Lacking perfection isn't good at all
Don't treat me like a king
Hang me like the sinner that I am
Your words repeat in my head
Like you give a damn

[Chorus:]
Let's get away
Drive out in the rain
Let's get away
Climb inside my brainYou might also like
