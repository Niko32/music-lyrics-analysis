We are each other’s hemispheres
I am fine tuning my soul
To the universal wavelength
No one is a lover alone
I propose an atom dance

[Verse 2: Björk]
Our hearts are coral reefs in low tide
Love is the ocean we crave
Restlessly turning around and around
I am dancing towards transformation
Learning by love to open it up
Let this ugly wound breathe
We fear unconditional heart space
Healed by atom dance

[Refrain: Björk]
When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me
We are each other’s hemispheres

[Verse 3: Björk & Anohni]
We aim at peeling off
Dead layers of loveless love
No one is a lover alone
Most hearts fear their own home
Most hearts, they fear their own home
Becoming themselves fully
It scares them off
You might also like[Refrain: Björk]
When you feel the flow as primal love
Enter the pain and dance with me

[Chorus: Anohni]
No one is a lover alone, lone
Most hearts fear their own home
You are my second hemisphere, hemisphere
The atoms are dancing, dancing

[Chorus: Björk & Anohni]
No one is a lover alone, lone
Most hearts fear their own home
You are my second hemisphere, hemisphere
The atoms are dancing, dancing

[Interlude: Björk]
Atoms are laughing at last
Atoms are laughing at last
At last, at last
Atoms are...

[Chorus: Björk & Anohni]
No one is a lover alone
No one is a lover alone, lone
Most hearts fear their own home
You are my second hemisphere, hemisphere
The atoms are dancing, dancing
