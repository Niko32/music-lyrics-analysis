If I told you I was yours, you'd probably label me a "bore"
Maybe I'm just trying way too hard to keep you
You're an angel and I'm blessed
So I am trying to do my best
Want you to know how very nice it was to meet you
So much time I spend to find something that I could call mine
Something real, out of all these phony people
And I know our past is tainted
It is a shame, now baby, ain't it?
But I'm willing, if you're willing
I'll be see through

[Chorus]
Can you take this chance on me?
(You won't regret it, c'mon and get it)
Love is like the lottery
(Yeah, we had issues, can we dismiss those?)
Can you take this chance on me?
(You won't regret it, c'mon and get it)

[Verse 2]
You're the only one I see
Yeah, we had issues
Can we dismiss those?
If to you I am indebted, don't expect you to forget it
But it's only gonna stop us if we let it
Yeah, it hit me like a gunshot
And from then 'til my burial plot
I'mma roll these dice until I hit the jackpot
Baby, I know I learned my lesson
Love was never my profession
I'm just learning as we're growing and progressing
No, I never meant to hurt you
It's myself, I didn't virtue
Now my mind is ready to give our love nurture
You might also like[Chorus]
Can you take this chance on me?
(You won't regret it, c'mon and get it)
Love is like the lottery
(Yeah, we had issues, can we dismiss those?)
Can you take this chance on me?
(You won't regret it, c'mon and get it)

[Outro]
You're the only one I see
Yeah, we had issues
Can we dismiss those?
