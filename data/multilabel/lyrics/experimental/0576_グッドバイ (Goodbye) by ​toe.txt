I don't go out, I will keep silence
Everyone is mania in general
You don't have
To know others

It's more complex than how I used to thought
But already I know
The start is the end
Everyone is mania in general
You don't have time to sleep
For to know others

うまく届かないんだ
また 次の不安か?
A disruption and blinder (Hm)
その先はないんだ (Hm)

[Instrumental]
