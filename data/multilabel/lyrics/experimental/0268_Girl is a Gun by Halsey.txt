I feel lighter in the waistline
With no hands around me, no spit in my teeth
No, I'm not your daydream, I won't have your baby
Stop 'cause you're killin' my vibe
It's a shot in the dark, I'm not a walk in the park
I come loaded with the safety switched off
This girl is a gun and we've been havin' some fun
And I can show you if you turn the lights on

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep waitin' for luck to come swallow me up
I feel better when the boys stop callin'
I keep fallin' in love, but this measurin' cup
Is overflowin' with the same damn problems

[Chorus]
This girl is a gun, before you know it, it's done
And you'll be wishin' that you crossed your fingers
Oh, but God, is it fun when you can have more than one
So let me show you how to touch my trigger

[Verse 2]
My newest baby's testin' me lately
Makin' me crazy from mornin' to evenin'
I cannot take it, I love it, I break it
Need it, leave it if I believe it's a waste of my
Time is a blessin', to me, it's a lesson
And I can't be stressin' to give you attention
'Cause, oh, it's never enough, so I'm givin' you up
And you'll be better with a nice girl, darlin'

I keep waitin' for luck to come swallow me up
I feel better when the boys stop callin'
I keep fallin' in love, but this measurin' cup
Is overflowin' with the same damn problems (Yeah)

[Chorus]
This girl is a gun, before you know it, it's done
And you'll be wishin' that you crossed your fingers
Oh, but God, is it fun when you can have more than one
So let me show you how to touch my trigger

[Pre-Chorus]
I keep waitin' for luck to come swallow me up
I feel better when the boys stop callin'
I keep fallin' in love, but this measurin' cup
Is overflowin' with the same damn problems (Yeah)

[Chorus]
This girl is a gun, before you know it, it's done
And you'll be wishin' that you crossed your fingers
Oh, but God, is it fun when you can have more than one
