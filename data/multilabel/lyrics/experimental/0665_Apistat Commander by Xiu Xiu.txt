Oh, along the rocks
It's good, it's not so hard now
Oh, I bite my tongue, who cares?
This chance to drop off

[Chorus]
All that you left, you left for someone
All of this hurt that's wilted off
All this relief, it's the oddest thing
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
All that you left, you left for someone
All of this hurt that's wilted off
All this relief, it's the oddest thing
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God

[Verse 2]
Chen, he'll never come
That's fine, I lost my thought
Wei Huai could talk me down
Still, still, this chance to drop off

[Chorus]
All that you left, you left for someone
All of this hurt that's wilted off
All this relief, it's the oddest thing
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
All that you left, you left for someone
All of this hurt that's wilted off
All this relief, it's the oddest thing
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God

[Chorus]
All that you left, you left for someone
All of this hurt that's wilted off
All this relief, it's the oddest thing
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
All that you left, you left for someone
All of this hurt that's wilted off
All this relief, it's the oddest thing
Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God
