Min warb naseu
Wilr made thaim
I bormotha hauni

Hu war (hu war)
Hu war opkam har a hit lot

Got nafiskr orf
Auim suimade
Foki afa galande

Hu war (hu war)
Hu war opkam har a hit lot

[Chorus: All]
Min warb naseu
Wilr made thaim
I bormotha hauni

Hu war (hu war)
Hu war opkam har a hit lot

Got nafiskr orf
Auim suimade
Foki afa galande
Hu war (hu war)
Hu war opkam har a hit lot

[Bridge: Christopher Juul and Kai-Uwe Faust ]
What am I supposed to do
If I want to talk about peace and understanding
But you only understand the language of the sword
What if I want to make you understand that the path you chose leads to downfall
But you only understand the language of the sword
What if I want to tell you to leave me and my beloved ones in peace
But you only understand the language of the sword
I let the blade do the talking
So my tongue shall become iron
And my words the mighty roar of war
Revealing my divine anger's arrow shall strike
All action for the good of all
I see my reflection in your eyes
But my new age has just begun
The sword is soft
In the fire of the furnace
It hungers to be hit
And wants to have a hundred sisters
In the coldest state of their existence
They may dance the maddest
In the morass of the red rain
Beloved brother enemy
I sing my sword song for you
The lullaby of obliteration
So I can wake up with a smile
And bliss in my heart
And bliss in my heart
And bliss in my heart
You might also likeCoexistence, Conflict, combat
Devastation, regeneration, transformation
That is the best I can do for you
I see a grey gloom on the horizon
That promises a powerful sun to rise
To melt away all moons
It will make the old fires of purification (of purification)
Look like dying embers
Look like dying embers
Look like dying embers
Look like dying embers
Look like dying embers
Look like dying embers
Look like dying embers
Look like dying embers
Look like dying embers
Look like dying embers

[Chorus: All]

Hu war opkam har a hit lot

Min warb naseu

I bormotha hauni

Hu war (hu war)
Hu war opkam har a hit lot
