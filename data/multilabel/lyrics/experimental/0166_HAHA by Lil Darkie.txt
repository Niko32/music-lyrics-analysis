"Darkie, why you looking so sad?"
Go and take a walk or write a song up on your notepad
For what you have, you should be grateful, why aren’t you more glad?
“Yo, keep on killing shit” “I'll see you later” “Oh, for sure man”
It’s been a fat ass minute, ain't been feeling right
A hypochondriac dissatisfied, my room got no light at times
Fuck all of the people judging you got, no right
And neither do I, the sight of new eyes, a side of you cries
Man, it’s been a minute, I been feeling bad
But I been fighting, I’m enlightened to the fact that I have limited time
I get to spitting these rhymes and lay a shit in your mind
They want my lips intertwined so they can leave me behind
But I will not submit, I will survive
Go make a difference while you are still alive
To be the bigger man requires that you standing high
The bigger man, the more time he fall before he die
There will always be a clown here to fake a smile for you
Running through the town laughing, I despise you too
(Hahahahahaha) Oh, did I surprise you cool?
“Get up,” “Do I gotta?” “Why don’t you arise, you fool?“

[Chorus 1]
Look at me, I put a face on, wow
Look at me, I put a show on when I go
"HA HA HA HA HA HA HA"
Laugh at the clown and his makeup
How does he feel when we wake up?
I don’t know and I don’t care
I’m unaware of how he faring
Glaring, staring at him so intently
At the fair inside the tent
You might also like[Verse 2]
He dance for the people, dance like you mean it
Motherfucker, everybody be too pussy to move
But grip they dick in they room
How the fuck did we ever put a stick in our moon?
It’s funny I’m a cartoon
But keep it realer than a bitch or her nigga that wanna feature
Lemme teach ya how I deal with these reachers that tryna leech us
Keep the fuck to my self and my spiders we throw a circus
For the good of my health, I make entertaining the purpose of it

[Chorus 2]
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
Sing along, have a ball
When the clown slip and fall
HA HA HA HA HA
HA HA HA HA HA HA HA
When the jester get mad
Put a gun in his hand
BA BA BA BA BA BA

[Outro]
Rest in peace to Robin Williams
Here to act for God and Villains
Brightest person, darkest feelings
Interfere with Satans' dealings
Yeah, yeah!
