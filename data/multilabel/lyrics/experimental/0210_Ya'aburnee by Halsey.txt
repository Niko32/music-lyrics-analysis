I get undertones of sadness
When I think about the moments
That I never got to spend with you
I can't decide
If I love you more in morning
Or I love you more at night
With its luminous lux tides
Maybe in the daylight
All its pretty madness
And the complicated status
'Cause the moon don't pick sides
And the sun won't resign
Until you're by my side
Because the longing leads to leaving
And the loving leads to bleeding
And your beauty is a blessing
And I never got to tell you how
I lovе the way my eyes makе yours look green too

[Chorus]
I think we could live forever
In each other's faces 'cause I'll
Always see my youth in you
And if we don't live forever
Maybe one day, we'll trade places
Darling, you will bury me
Before I bury you
Before I bury you
You might also like[Verse 2]
I'll never know
If there's danger in confession
Or it's memory that presses
Like a blade against my throat
Another word and I could choke
But what's worse?
Tellin' you my feelings
Or to die without revealing
That you crawled inside my head
And set a fire there instead?
Letting all my insecurity
Devour me with certainty
That love is just a currency
So take my pockets, take me whole
Take my life and take my soul
Wrap me in a wedding ring
You know I swear I'd give you anything

[Chorus]
And I think we could live forever
In each other's faces 'cause I'll
Always see my youth in you
And if we don't live forever
Maybe one day, we'll trade places
Darling, you will bury me
Before I bury you
Before I bury you
