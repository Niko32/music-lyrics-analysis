I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita
Vishnu was trying to persuade the prince that, he should do his duty
And, to impress him, takes on his multi-armed form, and says, "Now I am become death, the destroyer of worlds."

[Chorus]
Oh, how can this be? I've finally found peace
Just how long 'til she's stripped from me?
So come on, baby, in time we'll all freeze
Ain't no stoppin' that entropy

[Verse 1]
Am I just a dog who's found me a bone
Or perhaps if I've found a home?
Been sniffin' around all over the town
I just can't stop settlin' down

[Pre-Chorus]
His eye's on the sparrow, eyes is on me
More eyes than the KGB
Sometimes I'll suffer, sometimes I'll bleed
Not all at once, time flows linearly
Only forwards, never backwards
Seek the darkness, seek the laughter
Raise my jersey to the rafters
Let moths consume me in the light
You might also like[Chorus]
Oh, how can this be? I've finally found peace
Just how long 'til she's stripped from me?
So come on, baby, in time we'll all freeze
Ain't no stoppin' that entropy

[Verse 2]
So maybe my ego's out of control
Can that be avoided? I don't know
I hated myself when I was a boy
Now that I don't, they're tryna take my joy

[Pre-Chorus]
His eye's on the sparrow, eyes is on me (Eye's on the sparrow)
More eyes than the KGB (KGB)
Sometimes I'll suffer, sometimes I'll bleed (Sometimes)
Not all at once, time flows linearly (Flows)
Only forwards, never backwards (Backwards)
Seek the darkness, seek the laughter (Laughter)
Raise my jersey to the rafters
Let moths consume me in the light

[Chorus]
Oh, how can this be? I've finally found peace
Just how long 'til she's stripped from me?
So come on, baby, in time we'll all freeze
Ain't no stoppin' that entropy
Drifting towards the deep freeze
[Outro]
Thermodynamics, there's no escape
The good Lord he gives, the Lord he takes
No life without energy
Drifting towards the deep freeze
Thermodynamics, there's no escape
The good Lord he gives, the Lord he takes
No life without energy
Drifting towards the deep freeze
