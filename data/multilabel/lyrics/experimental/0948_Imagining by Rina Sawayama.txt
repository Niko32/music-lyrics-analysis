Could we be imagining?
Could we be imagining?
Could we be—

[Verse 1]
Wide awake
Didn't mean to lose my precious mind today (Mind today)
Sick and tired of waking up so far away (So far away)
I don't know if Mercury's in retrograde
Am I okay? Nah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna get too close, shit gets complicated (Ah)
I don't wanna take it off, emotionally naked (Ah)
Really don't feel too good, fake it till you make it (Ah)
I don't wanna talk right now, got me agitated

[Chorus]
I'm imagining
So tell me, what the fuck is up? What's happening?
Right now, my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging
I-I-I-I-I, I'm imagining
So tell me, what the fuck is up? What's happening?
Right now, my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging
I-I-I-I-I (Oh)
You might also like[Post-Chorus]
Could we be imagining?
I-I-I-I-I

[Verse 2]
B-bellyachеs, lidocaine
Suddenly, I find it hard to concentratе, yeah
Struggling to recognize the sight of me, ooh
I just wanna short-circuit the night away
Am I okay? Nah

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna get too close, shit gets complicated (Ah)
I don't wanna take it off, emotionally naked (Ah)
Really don't feel too good, fake it till you make it (Ah)
I don't wanna talk right now, got me agitated

[Chorus]
I-I-I-I-I-I-I'm imagining
So tell me, what the fuck is up? What's happening?
Right now, my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging
I-I-I-I-I, I'm imagining
So tell me, what the fuck is up? What's happening?
Right now, my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging
I-I-I-I-I, I'm imagining
So tell me, what the fuck is up? What's happening?
Right now, my sanity is gone, it's vanishing
I know I do this to myself, it's damaging
[Outro]
Could we be imagining? (Could I be imagining?)
Could we be imagining? (Could I be imagining? I-I-I-I)
Could we be imagining? (Could I be imagining?)
Could we be imagining? (Could I be imagining?)
Could we be imagining? (Could I be imagining? Yeah)
Could we be imagining? (Could I be imagining? Yeah)
Could we be imagining?
Could we be imagining?
–ing, –ing, –ing, –ing (Could I be imagining? Yeah)
(Could I be imagining? Yeah)
