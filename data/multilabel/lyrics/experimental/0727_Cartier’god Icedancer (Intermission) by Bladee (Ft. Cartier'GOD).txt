Yeah, Ocean Gang shit (Ooh, Cartier)
Yeah, you already know, shit, you know?

She loves the ocean, she loves the water
When that water turns to ice
Everything twice as nice (Woah)

You gon' dance on me 'cause I'm warmin' you (She dance on ice, don't come outside, yeah)
If dancin' on ice what she wanna do

You gon' dance on me 'cause I'm warmin' you (Oh)
