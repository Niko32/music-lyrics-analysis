I'm hauling an outdated shell
Help me let go
The walls around me are so close
Cavin' in, oh no
Some of the friends that I thought were forever
I now wanna sever the ties
The seeds have been sproutin', I'm no longer doubtin'
I think that it's finally time

[Chorus]
Pluto, destroy me
Kill me off slowly
I'll bathe in my ashes
Rise like a phoenix
Show me who I am becoming
Pluto, transform me
Turn off my lonely
I'll sit with my silence
Fix all my conflict
Show me the demons I'm hiding

[Verse 2]
I'm turnin' to expirеd routes
Help me movе on
There's nothing in this tired town
For me no more
What once was a home is a hell I can't manage
So send me to packin' it up
Everything's blurry, I don't wanna worry
The pain from this growing is rough, oh
You might also like[Chorus]
Pluto, destroy me
Kill me off slowly
I'll bathe in my ashes
Rise like a phoenix
Show me who I am becoming
Pluto, transform me
Turn off my lonely
I'll sit with my silence
Fix all my conflict
Show me the demons I'm hiding

[Outro]
(Show me the demons I'm hiding)
(Show me the demons I'm hiding)
Show me the demons I'm hiding (Pluto, destroy me)
Show me the demons I'm hiding
