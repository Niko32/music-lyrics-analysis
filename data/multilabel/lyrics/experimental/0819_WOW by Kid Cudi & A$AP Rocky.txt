Had this trippy dream, I was flyin', I was flyin', flyin' gone

Told the devil, "Wait a minute, I ain't ready" (Uh), anyone feel hopeless? You're at war
And I'm sittin' while I roll one, furthermore
Realest nigga in the cold, watch me surfin' (Yeah)
Heaven knows I'm just a soul who's on his search to find his home, know my angels got me, yeah
Drinkin', playin' sad songs, somethin' strange is goin' on, somethin' strange is goin' on
Seen the devil tryna creep up on me, dawg, and I got nowhere else to go, swimmin' all alone
And I'm stickin' to the code, no feelin' low (Yeah)
