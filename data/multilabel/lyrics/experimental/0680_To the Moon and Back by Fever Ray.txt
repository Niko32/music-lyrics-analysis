Hey, remember me?
I've been busy working like crazy
I know you like tangerine
And your kiss is sweet and creamy

[Verse 2]
Oh, can you imagine
Our friend's fixed for us to bump in
Oh, I'm done looking
Now things can start happening

[Verse 3]
Hey, remember me?
I've got so much, just come and get me
I played something catchy
You leaned forward and kissed me

[Verse 4]
First I take you then you take me
Breathe some life into a fantasy
Your lips, warm and fuzzy
I want to run my fingers up your pussyYou might also like
