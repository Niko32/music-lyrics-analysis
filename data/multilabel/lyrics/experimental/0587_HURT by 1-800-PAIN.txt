Hello pain

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm pissed off and I wanna start swingin'
I'm running faster and I summoned all my demons
I clenched my fist so hard I think it started bleeding
I'm pissed off and I wanna start swingin'

[Chorus]
Wanna see you
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, wanna see you
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, wanna see you

[Verse 1]
Bitch, if I die then you better say rip
Keep a .45 by my motherfuckin' hip
Got all the sauce, do you wanna take a sip?
Choppa turn you into salsa, break you off like a chip
Hundreds all blue like a motherfuckin' Smurf
Pussy wet, HM03, it's on surf
Better not catch you on my motherfuckin' turf
Choppa make 'em dance, make a motherfucker twerk
You might also like[Chorus]
Wanna see you
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, wanna see you
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, wanna see you

[Verse 2]
I can see your heart beating through your shirt
Aiming from an angle like I'm motherfuckin' Kurt
Clock in nigga, it's time to go to work
I'm about to bring the pain and I'm tryna make you hurt

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm pissed off and I wanna start swingin'
I'm running faster and I summoned all my demons
I clenched my fist so hard I think it started bleeding
I'm pissed off and I wanna start swingin'

[Chorus]
Wanna see you
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt
Wanna see you
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, wanna see you
[Verse 3]
Bitch, if I die then you better say rip
Keep a .45 by my motherfuckin' hip
Got all the sauce, do you wanna take a sip?
Choppa turn you into salsa, break you off like a chip
Hundreds all blue like a motherfuckin' Smurf
Pussy wet, HM03, it's on surf
Better not catch you on my motherfuckin' turf
Choppa make 'em dance, make a motherfucker twerk

[Chorus]
Wanna see you
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, wanna see you
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
Hurt, hurt, hurt, hurt
