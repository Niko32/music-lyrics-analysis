Don't come close, don't come close
You don't even know me, you think you know me
Don't come close
Don't come close (Oh, oh)
Don't come—, don't come—
Don't come close
[Verse 1: SZA]
Ice under my heels, I hear it breaking
Under my heels, I hear it cracking (Cracking)
Foolish of me to think I had it (Of, think I had it)
Emmanuel, how foolish of me (—Lish of me)
To think I had it (I had it)
I hear your voice behind me (Behind)
Moving up my neck, hear you— hear you talking
Creeping up my shoulder, breath— breathing
In my head, I hear you screaming (Screaming), just do it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you talking
Yeah, yeah, yeah, feel you moving
Yeah, yeah, let's do it, yeah—yeah
Yeah, yeah, oh (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 2: XXXTENTACION & SZA]
Don't come close, don't come closeYou don't even know me, you think you know me
Crucifixion, crack rock love, feeding my addiction
Pessimistic, feed her all the lies, and get self-infliction
Blood stains in my gold plates, without a soul, and pure hate
Insecure, ayy, couldn't love another at the same time
Ice cold, see my lover through the grapevine (Ah! Ah!)
History, mystery (Ah), hate her, fuck him
What's meant to me (Uh)? was it pure green?
But this ice can't melt (Fuck!), Ice Hotel

Chances, chances, chances, chances
Chances, chances, chances, chances
Chances, chances, chances, ice, ice, ice
Chances, chances, chances, chances
Ice, ice, ice, ice
Ice, ice, ice

[Outro: XXXTENTACION]
Feel the love in the air, hate what consumes from rates of the air
Hopped off, legislate for eight, seven virgins
Swerve and converge, her rapes lurking, curtain
Covered sins soon rest unwritten
Ice Hotel, Ice, Ice Hotel, Ice, Ice Hotel
