There's a woman, she fails him every time
She can't come down, she lives to be declined
There's a woman, she's every fantasy
And no reality in one

[Verse 2]
There's some gravity pullin' her essence down
There's a remedy for them motherfuckers around
There's a woman, she's every fantasy
And no reality in one

[Chorus]
It brings me back to life
How can I suffer without the pain?
Can we struggle without the shame?
It brings me back to life
How can I suffer without the pain?
Can we struggle without the shame?

[Refrain]
I wish I could cry
I wish I could die
I wish I could cry
I wish I could die
I wish I could cry for him
I wish I could cry for him
I wish I could cry for him
I wish I could cry
I wish I could die
I wish I could cry
I wish I could dieYou might also like
