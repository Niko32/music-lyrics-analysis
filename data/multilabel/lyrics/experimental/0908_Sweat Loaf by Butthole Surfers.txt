"Daddy?"
"Yes, son?"
"Wh-wh-wh-wh-what does regret mean?"
"Well, son, a funny thing about regret is
That it's better to regret something you have done
Than to regret something you haven't done."
"And by the way, if you see your mom this weekend
Would you be sure and tell her; Satan! Satan! Satan!"

[Chorus]
Oh!
Rape of desire (of desire, of desire, of desire)
Rape of desire (of desire, of desire, of desire)
Rape of desire (of desire, of desire, of desire)
Rape of desire (of desire, of desire, of desire)

[Bridge]
Oh!
Heads up
Believe me her
I ain't gonna lie
(Laughter)

[Chorus]
Oh!
Rape of desire (of desire, of desire, of desire)
Rape of desire (of desire, of desire, of desire)
Rape of desire (of desire, of desire, of desire)
Rape of desire (of desire, of desire, of desire)
Rape of desire (of desire, of desire, of desire)
Rape of desire (of desire, of desire, of desire)
Rape, rape, rape rape rape
Oh!
