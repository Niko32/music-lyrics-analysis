Ayo, Lil Mexico, pass the gas

[Chorus: Fat Nick]
I got real smoke, Xanax boats
Won't jump the porch without my pole
Serving out the Texaco
Smokin' Pemex, Lil' Mexico
Got big juice overflow
Wokeisha that I'm 'bout to pour
Hollows hit 'em in his throat
Jungle Boys smoke incredible
I, I, I got real smoke, Xanax boats
Won't jump the porch without my pole
Serving out the Texaco
Smokin' Pemex, Lil' Mexico
Got big juice overflow
Wokeisha that I'm 'bout to pour
Hollows hit 'em in his throat
Jungle Boys smoke incredible

[Verse 1: Shakewell]
Shoutout to Hades, I was out in Greece smokin' 80s
Peel the brown pack, all this OC-30 lately
Why they hate me? I been feelin' like the black sheep
Got this Glock 17, cold steel, hot heat
Let it burn, told that fuckboy go wait your turn
She gon' fall in love wit' it, way I make that pussy churn
When you gon' learn? Talkin' all that shit gon' get you hurt
If I pull up with the stick that mean you get put in the dirt
You might also like[Chorus: Fat Nick]
I got real smoke, Xanax boats
Won't jump the porch without my pole
Serving out the Texaco
Smokin' Pemex, Lil' Mexico
Got big juice overflow
Wokeisha that I'm 'bout to pour
Hollows hit 'em in his throat
Jungle Boys smoke incredible
I, I, I got real smoke, Xanax boats
Won't jump the porch without my pole
Serving out the Texaco
Smokin' Pemex, Lil' Mexico
Got big juice overflow
Wokeisha that I'm 'bout to pour
Hollows hit 'em in his throat

[Verse 2: Fat Nick]
They be sayin' they want smoke but don't want pressure, smokin' mid
And all my homies really shooters, facts, they only aim for heads
I'm fuckin' rollin, Xanax, Percs, I bought 'em, still 'bout rich as shit
And if you really gettin' money, don't be worried 'bout the next
This is south side, yeah, we will ride, yeah
We tote fire, yeah, this 30 play outside, yeah
We ride these foreign whips, and bro you broke as shit
And now Iâ€™m worth 'bout 7 figures so go catch a bitch
[Chorus: Fat Nick]
I got real smoke, Xanax boats
Won't jump the porch without my pole
Serving out the Texaco
Smokin' Pemex, Lil' Mexico
Got big juice overflow
Wokeisha that I'm 'bout to pour
Hollows hit 'em in his throat
Jungle Boys smoke incredible
I, I, I got real smoke, Xanax boats
Won't jump the porch without my pole
Serving out the Texaco
Smokin' Pemex, Lil' Mexico
Got big juice overflow
Wokeisha that I'm 'bout to pour
Hollows hit 'em in his throat
Jungle Boys smoke incredible
I, I, I got real smoke, Xanax boats
Won't jump the porch without my pole
Serving out the Texaco
Smokin' Pemex, Lil' Mexico

Wokeisha that I'm 'bout to pour
Hollows hit 'em in his throat
Jungle Boys smoke incredible
