You took a knee and put some food in my cage
And then you taught me how to sit and behave
You told me: "Lick your fingertips for a taste"
And then you smack me and you call me a waste

[Verse 2]
I guess you gave me a little surprise in my drink
Stumbled through the hall and hit my face on the sink
Woke up in panic and unable to see
The pain intensified consequently

[Chorus]
Haven't I been such a good good boy?
Haven't I been such a good good boy?
Haven't I been such a good good boy?
Haven't I been such a good good boy?
[Verse 3]
You took a knee and put some food in my cage
Then you taught me how to sit and behave
You told me: "Lick your fingertips for a taste"
Then you smack me and you call me a waste

[Chorus]
Haven't I been such a good good boy?
Haven't I been such a good good boy?
Haven't I been such a good good boy?
Haven't I been such a good good boy?
