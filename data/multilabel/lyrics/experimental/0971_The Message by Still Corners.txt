I love to drive the highways
The skyways just to get lost
I pass so many places
But won't brake 'cause I can't break your heart

[Chorus]
Drivin' till dawn
Call you from the station
Leavin' you a message that I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

[Refrain]
Gone
I'm gone
I'm gone

[Verse 2]
Seasons change so fast
They don't last
And the leaves always fall
Today is a new day
And there's a clear way
And the road is long

[Chorus]
Drivin' till dawn
Call you from the station
Leavin' you a message that I'm gone
You might also like[Bridge]
Oh I'm keeping on
Oh I'm keeping on
Oh I'm keeping on
Oh, oh

[Chorus]
Drivin' till dawn
Call you from the station
Leavin' you a message that I'm gone
Drivin' till dawn
Call you from the station
Leavin' you a message that I'm gone
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone

[Refrain]
That I'm gone
That I'm gone
