[Verse 1: SOPHIE]
Visions
Visions in my head
Visions of you and me, we're in love
Ecstasy
Feelings
Feelings in my skin
Feelings I want to know, want to hold
Broken free

Part II: Pretend World

[Distorted Vocals: SOPHIE & Cecile Believe]

[Cecile Believe]
I feel so cold
Is this the way I feel?
All along
You were just faking
Or was it all me
I could suffer
[?]
Tried to resist myself
I pretended for you
Was acting out this pretend fulfilling
It was just pretend, pretend, pretend
But it's so real for me
You were just pretending
You don't make me feel loved
You were making feelings
You made me up
Were we just pretending?
You're the reason I'll be there
In the bad times and the good times
I'll stand by you
I would choose you anywhere
