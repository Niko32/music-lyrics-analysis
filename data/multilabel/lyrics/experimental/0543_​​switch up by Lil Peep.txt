[Verse]
I had everybody hatin' on me on last year
Baby, that was last year, now I'm blowin' past, yeah
Whole squad with me smokin' on that Gas, yeah
Pass that over here, bitch, I'm tryna disappear (Poof)
I'm a ghost in my city, in your city I'm the most loved
All the young bitches fuckin' with me (Damn)

[Chorus]
I could never switch up on my brothers (Nah)
I put that on my mother
I could never switch up on my brothers (Nah, nah)
I put that on my mother (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I could never switch up on my brothers
I put that on my mother
I could never switch up on my brothers (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
I put that on my mother, know I love herYou might also like
