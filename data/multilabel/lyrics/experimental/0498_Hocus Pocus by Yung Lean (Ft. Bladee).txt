Skrrt, skrrt

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
All I roll is potent, we stay golden
We gone, hocus pocus, they think they know us
I'm flyin' in a Lotus, in a Range Rover
Is my life over?

[Post-Chorus: Yung Lean]
Take, take, take, take
Take control of, take control of me
Take control of Lean, take control of me
Yeah, it takes control of me

[Verse 1: Yung Lean]
White powder like a hill, take control of me (Take control)
When it hits my body, you know there's no stoppin' Lean
I don't like red, paint the roses green
Put a price up on my head, there's no controllin' me
I thought I was dead, but I'm livin' free
Walk up in the spot, bitch, it's SBE
Stack the money green, turn it into leaves
Six Air Force on my feet just like a centipede

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
All I roll is potent, we stay golden
We gone, hocus pocus, they think they know us
I'm flyin' in a Lotus, in a Range Rover
Is my life over? Is, is it over?

She don't want to understand, but I have a plan
Mixing alcohol and Xans, with my, with my gang
You can find me where I stand, Disney wonderland
I don't ever get attached, doesn't work like that
Doesn't work like that
Black bracelet, never show faces
Two pills runnin' round in the Matrix
Never show faces, never show faces
Two pills runnin' round in the Matrix

[Chorus: Yung Lean]
All I roll is potent, we stay golden
We gone, hocus pocus, they think they know us
I'm flyin' in a Lotus, in a Range Rover
Is my life over?
All I roll is potent, we stay golden
We gone, hocus pocus, they think they know us
I'm flyin' in a Lotus, in a Range Rover
Is my life over?

[Outro: Yung Lean]
Take, take, take, take
Take control of, take control of me
Take control of Lean, take control of me
Yeah, it takes control of me
