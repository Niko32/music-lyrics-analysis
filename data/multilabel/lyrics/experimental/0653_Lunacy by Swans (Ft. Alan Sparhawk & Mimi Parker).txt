In the mind of no one
Forming sun, forming love
Break the chain, hide within
Innocence, not innocent
Innocent in no sense
Eat the beast, keep him in
Take the blame, speak the name

[Refrain]
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy

[Verse 2]
Hide beneath, your monkey skin
Feel his love, nurture him
Kill the truth or speak the name

[Refrain]
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
Lunacy, lunacy
