Play me some of that suicide pimpin', man

[Verse 1: Black Window & Duck Boy]
It's the most wanted, most hated, most haunted
Boys that paid the cost, slowly dyin' but I'm flossin'
Looking good, ain't he? Boy bounced back from the dead
My business still shady, I still tiptoe on the ledge
That shit ain't ever changin' (Scarecrow)
I take my chance riding dirty while speedin', lane swangin'
I fuckin' made it to 30 without my neck breakin'
My gun that's holdin' a 30 that got his legs shakin'
Meanwhile his girl in the room with my picture masturbatin' (Ooh-ooh)
Yeah, slowly crawling out the dirt (Ahh-ahh)
When it comes to death I like to flirt (Wha⁠— Wha⁠—)
My hills have eyes and a smirk (Yeah, yeah)
My cuz got blues and he got that syrup, boy (If I, if I)

[Verse 2: Duck Boy]
If I keep it up, all these 30s 'gon kill me before thirty (Yeah)
Another day wasted up my nose and it's still early
Don't you worry (No), I'm always in a hurry (Yeah)
So I copped a foreign coupe (Skrrt)
Slidin' 'round town 'til I gotta pull up to the court at noon (Objection)
Snort another blue
Now I'm feeling sorta blue, nothin' new, one of the chosen few
The rest of y'all, give him some room (Yeah)
It's best if y'all didn't assume (Yeah)
That he is destined for imminent doom
Unless he is ready to get in the tomb (Uh-huh)
Ruby's such a bum but he make it look good
Trunk in the front, yeah, that's what's under the hood
Talking' all this shit, mane, I wish y'all really would
Another million plays, mane, I wish y'all really couldYou might also like
