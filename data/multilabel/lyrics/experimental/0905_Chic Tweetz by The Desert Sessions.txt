Chic Tweets
Yeah, super cool
Yeah, well, y'know, I think I've probably eaten a lot of, uh
A lot of paste

[Verse 1 - Töôrnst Hülpft & Matt Berry]
All right, yeah

I sent you chic tweets
Unanswered for weeks
I want to take peeks in those cheeks

I sent you this hot fax
And you gave me de ax
I said I would wax all your cracks
What's with that?

Nice ass!
Well, give it a grasp
You better move fast
I've got gas (he's got gas)

You've got a big nose
Oh beat me with a hose (with hoes)
Put me in dispose or dat pose
We'll see how it goes
You might also likeMilkin' sheep teats
These goddamn sheep
I shave 'em and count dem to sleep

Send me some nude pics
Or let's make naughty flicks
Just cram me in your mix
I got tricks

What's with these hot nights?
I'm wearing these tights
They're so chunky tight at night

You made a big stink
Now you get da wink
Maybe pour me a drink, mein schmutzfink?

For spite I wore these tights
You jealous, you little hamstring man?
Vell come and get me

[Chorus - Töôrnst Hülpft]
Chic tweets
For planting the seed
Chic tweets
Let's do the deed (I’m a tiger!)
Chic tweets, chic tweets, chic tweets, chic tweets
[Post-Chorus - Töôrnst Hülpft & Matt Berry]
Is this the reggae?
I realized at this point, I'd made a terrible mistake
Matt!
I was playing very bad organ
Matt! Matt?
And I needed a way out
Schnell inner monologue!
I couldn't see the door

[Verse 2 - Töôrnst Hülpft]
You've made me go "ouch"
Unt smashin’ mein pouch
I was just lying on the couch, you big grouch

The dumb shark, you go to ze park
And then... uh... go to ze park, I guess

Chic tweets, I sent you
Chic tweets, those are mine

Huge feet, like boats in ze fleet
Your toes are like meat, it's so sweet

Timeline, that's... going fine
Matt, those are mine (those are his)
Bring those over here
Thanks a lot

Matching tattoos
Now, here is the news
I'm getting both of yous on a cruise
You know we can't lose

[Outro - Töôrnst Hülpft & Matt Berry]
Shit, I thought it was going great
You stopped them chunky jam
Matt, that was great
Yeah, that was great, yeah
You must be thankful
Hah, I am
Got to appreciate the good things in life
That was good
That's a huge jam
"Timeline, those things are mine", that was the best
Well, they are mine, so I take them with me to Lapland
