Big bags, push it, push it
Big bags, push it, push it, vision
Big bags, push it, push it (Can you see the vision?)
Big bags, push it, push it (Can you see the vision?)

[Verse 1: Jaden]
SYRE died in the sunset, don't be like him
ERYS was born in the dark, then was handed a s****
A lot of shit I'm thinkin' 'bout I never plan to admit
That's why I had to make the canvas in brick
I understand they don't get it
They just wanna see the flick of the wrist
All the raps, pink pistols and drip
They in the stands and they trippin', man
They don't listen, but it's simple as shit
Give me a minute while I paint this picture
Man, no one figures it was ERYS and the boys in the city doin' chores
'Cause you know he gotta push that vision
Idea connoisseur, our protector with the scorch, no remorse
Man, you get it homie, business is business
There's a lot of fire for all when your city's fair share of our collisions got hot, almost turned to a scrimmage
I had to run around the block, young nigga was winnin'
So when I'm whippin', switch plates and the windows is tinted
Man, this shit is so different
Los Angeles it's all fake and ERYS a young genius
He's gonna take it
No traces on the clothes, gotta pack it naked
As-Salāmu Alaykum pray to God I make it
We run the city with these vision laces
New mayor, if they break it, I'ma renovate it
I just push the pen to the haters
Got demons but I been a slayer
ERYS flex like Menelaus
They just need to switch behavior
'Cause this is what I call
You might also like[Chorus: ¿Téo?]
Chase, run 'em down, fuck it up
Run, run it down, fuck it up
Run it, running 'round, fuck it up
Yeah, set it up, fuck it up (Woo)
Yeah, give 'em loud, fuck it up
Yeah, say it loud, fuck it up
Run it, run around, run it, run it up

[Verse 2: Jaden]
Them boys got a line around the corner, probably shut down
We don't ever see 'em when the sun is out
Lotta pink shine when I'm runnin' 'round
And I'm still waitin' on the hunnid thou'
Really, out here helpin' people you don't give a fuck about
Lift off for the clique, they pissed off
Crystal, sip, sip, let them niggas talk
Young boy, i-drip-or-is, I been the one
Jeweler hit my line he said "What color for the neck?"
I told him "Pink"
Flood me with that dummy shit, more water than the sea
Honey, I speak it to so-and-so, I'm rollin' up my sleeve, jeez
If I'm honest, we the hottest by the beach, see
Shit, they don't believe, so I had to let her—

[Refrain: Tyler Cole & Jaden]
Another young nigga gone in the sunset
We were shootin' down the drones, we were upset
They was comin' for my fam, homie, fuck that
We was runnin' from the feds in the garden (In the)
[Bridge: Jaden]
From the pink
Flood me with the dumbest shit, that drippy in my drink
Take a straw when I sip it, got a hit me, I'm a beast (Let's go)
Couple pillies feelin' trippy, feel like shootin' in the streets
Niggas silly, they don't feel me, so I gotta let em' see it

[Refrain: Tyler Cole & Jaden]
Another young nigga gone in the sunset
We were shootin' down the drones, we were upset
They was comin' for my fam, homie, fuck that
We was runnin' from the feds in the garden

[Outro: ¿Téo?]
Oh, my rebel child, another died today
Oh, my rebel child, the sun is gone away
Oh, my rebel child, watch your back tonight
Oh, my rebel child, you might lose your light
Oh, my rebel child, another died today
Oh, my rebel child, the sun is gone away
Oh, my rebel child, watch your back tonight
Oh, my rebel child, you might lose your light
