Father, forgive me, for you know, that I'm always sinning
And I, and I, mhm, mhm-mhm
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Excuse my language, that's a hang-up on how shitty I'm feeling
And I to-o-old, uh
I'm sorry, I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute
And I, and I survived the night
So, Father, forgive me, for you know, that I'm always sinning
I take no interest partying with liquor, fucking up my system
Oh, why'd you lie? You lied, you lied, you lied, you lied
Excuse my language, that's a hang-up on how shitty I'm been feeling
Realize, that this life
I'm sorry, I feel no attraction, I know that it's been a minute
So—

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can, but you can't hide
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can

[Post-Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Inner soul, dark and light fight for the control
Nobody knows
Inner soul, dark and light fight for the control
Don't anyone know? Don't anyone know?

I take a Perc' then I take me a nap
Take a sip of the syrup, so I could go relax
Bitch, I'm ready for war when the demons attack
Hell yeah, believe that

[Pre-Chorus: Juice WRLD]
One to the face, don't fuckin' hesitate
I'm high as Heaven's gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down
One to the face, don't fuckin' hesitate
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven's gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven's gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down (Realize that—)
Bitch, I'm high as Heaven's gates
Ain't no comin' down, comin' down

[Chorus: Juice WRLD]
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can, but you can't hide
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can, but you can't hide
Realize your dark side collides inside
You run as fast as you can
