Stop playing with those other girls
It makes me jealous, baby
I want to be the only one
The only one, the only one

[Pre-Chorus]
Stop playing with those other girls
You know it drives me crazy
I'm feeling like a loaded gun
And when it's done, I'm the only one

[Chorus]
I'm your doll
Wind me up, I'm your doll
Dress me up, I'm your doll
Love me rough, I'm your doll
I'm your doll, I'm your doll
Wind me up, I'm your doll
Dress me up, I'm your doll
Love me rough, I'm your doll
I'm your doll

[Verse 2]
Complete, I'm here
Just hoping that you want me too
Look into my eyes, my eyes
Complete, I'm here
I'm here, I'm here
Look into my eyes
And tell me that you're here too
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
Stop playing with those other girls
You know it drives me crazy
I'm feeling like a loaded gun
And when it's done I'm the only one

[Chorus]
I'm your doll
Wind me up, I'm your doll
Dress me up, I'm your doll
Love me rough, I'm your doll
I'm your doll, I'm your doll
Wind me up, I'm your doll
Dress me up, I'm your doll
Love me rough, I'm your doll
I'm your doll

[Outro]
I'm your doll, I'm your doll
