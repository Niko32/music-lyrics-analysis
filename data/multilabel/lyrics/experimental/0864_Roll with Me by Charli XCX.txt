[Verse 1]
We shine when the lights go out
I wanna kiss you in the nightclub
Lips brush right across your mouth
My heart is beating and it won't stop

[Pre-Chorus]
You, you got me feeling a second away
You make me feel like I wanna scream out
Ooh, we got this moment, don't let it slip away
So tell me, now I gotta find out

[Chorus]
Do you want to roll with me?
Do you want to roll with me? Say yeah

Your touch got me off the ground
It's like we're living in a daydream
Skylines spinning 'round and 'round
And then you tell me that you love me
