[Verse 1]
Bring the sun, spins around and around and around
Bring the sun, spins around and around and around
Bring the sun, spins around and around and around
Bring the sun, spins around and around and around
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine, is it mine
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine, is it mine
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine, is it mine
Is it mine, is it mine, is it mine, is it mine
Spins around and around and around and around
Spins around and around and around and around
Spins around and around and around and around
Spins around and around and around and around

[Chorus]
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
Sun, sun, bring the sun
