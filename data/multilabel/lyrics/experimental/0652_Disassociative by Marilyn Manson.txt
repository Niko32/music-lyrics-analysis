I can tell you what they say in space
That our Earth is too grey
But when the spirit is so digital
The body acts this way

[Refrain]
That world was killing me
World was killing me, disassociative

[Pre-Chorus]
The nervous system's down
The nervous system's down, I know
The nervous system's down
The nervous system's down, I know

[Chorus]
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna just float in fear
Dead astronaut in space
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna just float in fear
Dead astronaut in space

[Verse 2]
Sometimes we walk like we were shot
Through our heads, my love
We write our song in space like we're
Already dead and gone
You might also like[Refrain]
Your world was killing me
World was killing me, disassociative
Your world was killing me
World was killing me, disassociative

[Chorus]
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna just float in fear
Dead astronaut in space
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna just float in fear
Dead astronaut in space

[Bridge]
The nervous system's down
The nervous system's down
The nervous system's down
The nervous system's down
(4, 3, 2, 1...)

[Chorus]
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna just float in fear
Dead astronaut in space
I can never get out of here
I don't wanna just float in fear
Dead astronaut in space
