[Verse 1]
Said I'm older and I'm sober in the middle of October
Living like I wanna die, but it feel right (Yeah)
Met a bitch a little older, like a bucket, knock her over
Made me forget about thoughts of suicide (Ayy)

[Chorus]
So throw that pussy at me, baby
Throw that pussy at me, baby
Made them legs go up like doors on suicide
(Made them legs go up like doors on sui- oh)
Throw that pussy at me, baby
Throw that pussy at me, baby (Throw that, throw it)
Living life like I wanna die, but it feel right, yah (Yeah, ayy)

[Verse 2]
Bitch, I'm smooth like grape in juice, okay
You smooth like pulp in O and J (Oh)
I killed that pussy like O and J (Oh)
Like A-okay (Oh), Like A-okay (Oh)
My hunting rifle, A-okay
I'm hunting down the KKK (Phew-phew-phew, phew)
Tell their mothers and aunties that I am free today (Ayy)
I'm free today (Ayy), I'm free today (Ayy)
Fuck it up, fuck is up, niggas always nuttin' up
Man, I'm never shutting up, collared shirt with buttons up
The world don't give out love enough, I will be the light of us
Truths only confinin' us and I will be the guide of us (Yeah)
Fall back to the basics, ayy
Getting top from two bitches and it is gracious, ayy
What's the location? Great Wall up out in Asia, ayy
And I'm wondering if her daddy is racist, ayy (Hey, hey)

Guns up in designer denim (What? What?)
I think they be Ksubis (Ho-wee)
Your bitch Icky Vicky (Ho-wee)
That ho got the cooties (Ho-wee)
Only time that I would touch her (Ho-wee)
When I give her noogies (Ho-wee)
Either that or when I'm tryna rub off one my boogies (Ho-wee)

[Chorus]
So throw that pussy at me, baby (Ho-wee)
Throw that pussy at me, baby (Ho-wee)
Made them legs go up like doors on suicide
(Made them legs go up like doors on sui- oh)
Throw that pussy at me, baby (Ho-wee)
Throw that pussy at me, baby (Ho-wee, throw that, throw it)
Yeaaah, ayy
