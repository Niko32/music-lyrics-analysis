I know you want it
The thing that makes me (You know I'm just sayin' man, ah)
What the guys, guys go crazy for

[Verse 1: JPEGMAFIA]
Is it the car, the clothes, the money, the jewelry, the cribs, the drugs or the hoes?
Is it the ket, the meth, the weed, the lean, the molly, the boy, or the blow?
You can get rocked like Chrisean
How you hating and broke, no fixing 'em
Riding dick like these rappers are Sybians
Try to press 'em, they lost like Gilligan
I got Jay for my Bey
'Bout thе money, call me Mr. Slate
Wеirdo rap, I'm the numero ace
Put together like Danity Kane
Fuck your feelings, I'm stuck in my ways
Local niggas be stuck in they place
They don't say none of that shit to my face
'Cause they know I take shots like Klay
I wanna rock right now
Hittin' whippets and eating halal
Get to clippin' while whippin' these sounds
You get hit, you gon' sing like Bilal, uh
Back it up
If I see that bitch, I'm actin' up
'Cause something right here ain't adding up
Smack it up
100, ain't no wack in us

Push it to the maximum
I do what I want to
So it ain't no asking them
Mashing 'em, knocking 'em out park
The way we smackin' 'em, immaculate
If I'm in area, that's hazardous
Way out there, I'm too far gone
Leave me alone, let me in my zone
Just fall back, I'ma put you on
Lost out here, can't find no home
Going up, so tap in
I'ma bout to take you for a spin
So buckle up
Nigga we 'bout to go in
Hands on the wheel no accident
Hands on the wheel no accident
Came through kicking doors off hinges
Look at him, he so expensive
Make her hop all in my mentions
When she see it's so extensive
Set it up, I'ma knock it all down
Give me a ring, I give you rounds
Lost and found, when you hear that sound
I just wanna see you jump around
Welcome to my house of pain
Where you can get everything
Coming down like April rain
Yes, you may just say my name
Pull up on me, we outside
I'm about to take you for a ride
No one safe, so run and hide
No one safe, so run and hide
Let me tell you what I'm gon' do
Tell no lies, just tell your truth
I'm a big dog like Marmaduke
Park itself when I come through
Pull up on me, we outside
I'm about to take you for a ride
No one safe, so run and hide
No one safe, so run and hide

My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard

Teach you, it's better than
Teach you, but I have to
My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard
And they're like, it's better than yours
Damn right, it's better than yours
I can teach you, but I have to charge
I know you want it, want it, want it, want it
