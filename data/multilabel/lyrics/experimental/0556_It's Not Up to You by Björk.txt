I wake up and the day feels broken
I tilt my head, I'm trying to get an angle
'Cause the evening I've always longed for
It could still happen

[Pre-Chorus]
How do I master the perfect day?
Six glasses of water
Seven phone calls
If you leave it alone, it might just happen
Anyway

[Chorus]
It's not up to you, oh, it never really was
It's not up to you, oh, it never really was
It's not up to you, well, it never really was
It's not up to you

[Verse 2]
If you wake up and the day feels a-broken
Just lean into the crack (Just lean into the crack)
And it will tremble ever so nicely
Notice how it sparkles down there

[Pre-Chorus]
I can decide what I give
But it's not up to me
What I get given
Unthinkable surprises about to happen
But what they are
You might also like[Chorus]
It's not up to you, well, it never really was
It's not up to you, oh, it never really was
It's not up to you, no, it never really was
It's not up to you, oh, me, share
It's not up to you
It's not up to you, oh, it never really was
It's not up to you, well, it never really was
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to you
It's not up to you

[Outro]
There's too much clinging to peak
There's too much pressure
