F-F-FROMTHEHEART

[Verse 1: VALENTINE]
Can't keep track of the time
They say that it'll be fine
I'm damn near losin' my mind
Can't keep running away

[Chorus: kmoe]
Losin' it
Lately, I've been losin' it
They say, "You'll get used to it"
They say, "You'll get used to it"
Lately, I've been losin' it
Lately, I've been losin' it
They say, "You'll get used to it"
They say, "You'll get used to it"

[Verse 2: quinn & brakence]
Wait, I don't know where I'm at
I done lost my way, even lookin' at the map
I was tryna live my life, then I fell into a trap
But that's how shit is, I can't argue with that
I was walkin' the way that they wanted me to
And they still didn't like me, so fuck all them too
Do what I want with whoever I want and whenever I want
But lately, I've been losin' it
With life, I've just been cruisin' it
I got people who do what I say to do
So, obviously, I don't need you
How many times should I tell you, "I hate you"
'Til you get it? I don't get you
Fuck me? Then, fuck you
You don't know me? I don't know you (Oh, oh, oh)
You might also like[Verse 3: brakence]
That's why I ghosted you
What the fuck was I supposed to do? (Supposed to do?)
Where're my social cues?
Funny thing, I've been avoidin' you
'Cause I don't know me either
Thought takin' that tab would delete it
Now I'm on a one-way track to my demons
And ever since that
I've been losin' composure
Feeling shoulder-to-shoulder
Summer's never been colder
Don't wanna die when I'm older
And get a routine, so I'm letting go
I've never been a bad guy
December I'll be home, 'cause I'm—

[Chorus: kmoe]
Losin' it
Lately, I've been losin' it
They say, "You'll get used to it"
They say, "You'll get used to it"
Lately, I've been losin' it
Lately, I've been losin' it
They say, "You'll get used to it"
They say, "You'll get used to it"
[Verse 4: ericdoa]
Take my hand and run away
I wouldn't have this any other way
Don't need your love, I suffocate
So I'll get drunk, man, what a waste
Expensive clothes, designer drugs
You think it's not enough
No else's does, you tweetin' sucks
You need to tighten up

[Verse 5: glaive]
And he has a wife, but he loves his mistress
If you blink twice, you might fuckin' miss it
I cross my enemies off my hit list
I'm worthless, just a pot to piss in
I slam my head against the wall
And I know you don't care at all
And I can't seem to brush it off
Need ego-death and Adderall

[Bridge: brakence]
Ooh, never thought it'd hurt to try
You hurt me when you looked in my eyes
Like, "Hurry, we ain't got no time"
And you, keep shootin' all my birds from the air
Cl—clueless to the fact that I don't care
'Cause when the world's ending
I can't be fendin' for myself
[Chorus: kmoe]
Losin' it
Lately, I've been losin' it
They say, "You'll get used to it"
They say, "You'll get used to it"
Lately, I've been losin' it
Lately, I've been losin' it
They say, "You'll get used to it"
They say, "You'll get used to it" (Yeah)
