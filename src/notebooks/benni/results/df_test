2935,470841,Knee Length Socks,Urthboy,en,rap,"Rushing out of Kings Cross Station spill into the
Glow of Darlinghurst Road underneath the Coke sign
Hidden in the hip folk, bright red and white
Lights and the bouncers inviting me to strip shows
I was seventeen with a face of fifteen
Carried my skateboard with me through the slipstream
You could be the king of the Cross or just sightseeing
Or take flight from the limelight like me
My brother ran a nightclub playing Britpop
In a club called Les Girls
Once upon a time it was owned by Abe Saffron
Long way from Oasis to the underworld
He would sneak me in before 10 when the doors opened
And the dancefloor dark and scarce
And the bartender knew I wasn't legal
Both of us pretended that the other wasn't there
I was about to learn

[Hook]
There girls in knee length socks
Did not dance like I did, I
Did not dance Indie kid, they
Did not dance like me
In Fred Perry shirts, these guys
Did not dance like I did, I
Did not dance Britpop kid, they
Did not dance like me
So whatcha whatcha want?

By 12 with the party proper kicking
Room full of Albarns, Cockers and Frischmanns
A couple Ian Browns and they're dancing to The Smiths
And there I am in the middle of the dancefloor pissed
I was showing of my Running Man, shake it like Q-Tip
Bonita Applebum clip like I was on some new shit
Proper etiquette: hide it, shield it
But Screamadelica had Don't Fight It, Feel It
Indie girls danced like perky little penguins
There She Goes I fell in love but afraid to befriend 'em
I wish I could've told her that I loved Suede
Or the way she swung her hands by her sides like rotorblades
Could've put a British accent on
Pashed her in the chorus of a catchy song (yep)
With the charm of a trashy Pom like
""'allo love, wanna snog?""

[Verse 3]
Grabbed my skateboard from the cloakroom
Found Kings Cross with her legs wide open
What kind of trouble could a kid get his nose in
When the best of the seediest part of Sydney blows in?
I was never caught by the fuzz while I was still on the buzz
A bit before I dabbled with drugs
Pills, Thrills, Bellyaches, E's and Whiz
Whatever it takes to medicate please a swig
I did a bit I admit I was not innocent
I didn't fit in but I felt magnificent
Banging through my eardrums differently
Like I got a new set of antennas for them bitches to listen with
I look back realise what it meant to me
Why I wrote hooks and melodies
I'm part of their legacy
But I never did get her next to me
I guess that was for the best Goddamn

Chase the cord and burning bridges following tracks across my hand

Crushed by a tree
Fork in my tongue

What I hafta say with little laughter
This is the mourning after
When it’s me, you passed and the pastor

One minute you’re here the next one you’re gone
We at the wake wonderin’ what’s going on
Most of them folk cryin’ till dawn word is bond
My mind blank Thank God I’m truly whole
Feelin’ this calm wind goin’ through my soul
Weird role ‘cuz I’m in total control
Watchin’ all this shit unfold (Watchin’ my life unfold)
Like I’m not even here I have no fear
K-9 bites couldn’t be more clear
Clearer would be a chest heavin’ and sobbin’
Stoppin’ too grim reaper done robbed ‘em
Near Hachiko yo with my feel akimbo
Gray clouds are rain and no cymbals
Feels like a kick from Daniel Dae Kim yo
Yo this leaves me in limbo although
Bro, people gonna die around me yo

When it’s me, you passed and the pastor
You might also likeI ain’t got no tears then I gotta pen
You know I lost the plot I never did listen
Wrote this for my ken and kin when
This LSD reality hooked me to my playpen
Amen is not enough to rid this carcinogen
Lookin’ down at a bottle the world’s dead
Blocks where darkness’s hell lead instead
It had to happen again
Sad days is what it’s been
All in a morass you were shut in
It was so much more light
Aight I was young we had to fight
Lookin’ back it wasn’t too bright
They called me, told me: he died last night
So many might go,  call this side blight
Feelings to fight I express turned plight
Now finally you’re alright you’re outasight
No worries as your soul took flight

When it’s me, you passed and the pastor
You only pass this way a little ways
Praise I disobey chaos. Anarchy can stay
Pray is the most I could say
Moments of peace’s mainstay may sway
Okay is the answer to the momentary lie
Close the door of my room to cry
Rose at four to scream at the sky
Lost some high
Some others should have died
We should have tried
Read the words of the eulogy to sigh
Their voices choices fallen on deaf ears
My mind filled up with tsunamis of tears
All my acts hurricanes fallin’ off plain insane
This deep weight of pain itchin up my vein
Shares of players pain delayers false airs
Am I the only one who cares…  

Trusting no one these days
Dude that’s just a damn haze
Lost a generation to this heat
Lost emancipation to some heat
My words to you were incomplete
Threw in the towel my cypher’s incomplete
I’m my own shook no more teats
Soldier broke pickin’ butts offa street
I’m frozen numb like winter’s concrete
All people turn dumb for some reason
Watchin’ my life turn to crumbs
Some won
My heart’s on the run if I overcome
Ho hum is every second I spent spend
Hallowed out wish the stratosphere would rend
This is the mourning after
This chapter Times with no laughter
Friendship’s so far evaded hard to capture
These waves of loss it’s all gone dross
It’s all been tossed like floss embossed

More rum, I unleash the motherfucking kraken-
I see the fear in your eyes, yeah I see you backin'
Off from me, that’s the philosophy
Im just awesome bre, you rap awfully;
And tell your bitch to stop callin me, so often, G
I don’t know how I'm gonna get her the fuck off of me

[Miike Snow]
There was a time when my world was filled with darkness, darkness, darkness
Then I stopped dreaming. Now I'm supposed to fill it up with something, something, something

[Verse 2: Clout]
Born in 93 and developed a complex
Coppin' fitteds and Chucks like it was a contest
I keep going harder than the hardest;
Shakespearean flow, up on my bard shit
Have to be honest- don’t write in sonnets
Still I promise like the infallible Psalmist
I sip Patron, you get drunk off your mom's Vex,
Then I sodomize your mom like I’m John West.
Shit, I’m an animal, alien, or a cannibal-
Verbally violate like a non-violent Hannibal.
Got the flow of a fuckin' gentleman
Even though these drugs got me going mental, man
Like I loath this fear, so dazed and confused-
My head: a mess of illusions and Zeppelin tunes-
Thrust into loneliness by this society
Seems like popularity is anything but piety
""Shit, dog, I’m trying, b. Stop lyin’ to me.""
Horsepower hit home with Boxer’s care-
Beware of dogs, it ain’t fair out there
Devil on my shoulder addicted to salt
I keep saying, “it’s ok, it’s not your fault
He doesn’t exist, none of this matters.""
My heart ignores the mind’s chatter...
Static matter, franticly thoughts scatter:
""It’s ok, I told you it wasn’t your fault
You could be an animal, alien, or a cannibal-
You know you and me ain’t nothing but mammals.
It all boils down to that killer instinct
And man you’re not gonna find me going extinct
Just listen.""

[Verse 3: Clout]
I’m a nation under God if it’s all or one;
Because it’s all or none, even though it seems all for none!
And if you swear you’re an eagle I’m a lion
But I think you’re all just a bunch of sheep, doe
A real bird would escape all the fightin’
Fly above that, and into liberty grow
That’s something an animal just doesn’t know:..
Is what I am. I dare you to frame my symmetry
Come on, go ahead and create some imagery
Poetry is all stolen things; cold is all it brings
Covers true natures with twists of diction-
Founders of nothing but mere myths of fiction-
An idea looking for a pussy to stick its dick in-
Fuck I’m not usually this skeptic, I must be kidding
But for an animal it must be fitting...

I heard of a saint who had loved you
So I studied all night in his school
He taught that the duty of lovers
Is to tarnish the golden rule
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure
He drowned himself in the pool
His body is gone, but back here on the lawn
His spirit continues to drool

With the face of a goddess, packed a real boddess
I mean nobody was the hottest
Around the way fine she was looking real decent
Graduated soon, I ain't seen her recent
Till one night I rolled out pretty far
She was shaking her ass and getting loud at the bar
90 pounds heavy with the rolls on her belly
And her underarms smelly
What happened to my class queen?
I mean her breath was stinking, fought off with the apple sheen
Speed freak in a g-string dancing
Teasing me, plus telling me I'm handsome
Looked like she had enough to keep herself up
That's what they told me cause I had swelter

Who is it that you see

Have you ever tried to speak the truth instead of lie
When it seemed you had everything to lose
Have you ever tried to stand your ground instead of hide

Every girl a half a heartbreak
Every woman sold into shame

Saw a cross in the splinters

Like bodies falling from a constellation
An uncivil war divides the nation

I could smell the fire from miles away
But I was always going to run after the chase
I didn't leave you, I just went my own way

Like the first the day that I got off of the plane
And nobody cared to know of my name
I think I've been here

3667,830243,A Filthy Addiction,The Crimson Armada,en,rock,"A lifetime of disbelief is now shackled by its throat
For he never turned unto the gates but burned it down with earth
He ingests his wealth, contemplates the drain, his emerald soul
His grave will sleep warm of opulent eyeballs
And at the summoning grounds is the reunion where abundance is abound
Broken teeth are found in the bones and backs beyond the flesh of animals
And so began:
A filthy addiction
The price on life had begun to substitute
Thus he verbalized for every sad inhuman worth
Broken teeth are found in the bones and backs beyond the flesh of animals
And so began:
A filthy addiction
The price on life had begun to substitute
And so commenced the sick unholy glowing green addiction
Thy thirst to strip the forest keeps the world in cold affliction
Sunk its leaves of sustenance, drilling holes in all his teeth
Locked the spoils in their place
""Carry your grin between your greed""
Infinitely basking, is his chest displaced with gold?
The mountains have not piled yet, must he slit a robins throat?
The years will multiply and yet he never feels content with himself and now he turns to burn the garden of paradise
Nothing saves
Behold there is no gold that saves your soul
To quantify salvation is to be unborn
There is no price on life to be paid
Every man is his own savior
His basking is now met with an unfortunate realization

Or I’m too conceptual, and you not understanding me
I never liked Canibus
No he’s not a wack emcee
He was just confusing and I hope you don’t get that from me
But if you do, this is my rapping plea
I’m on medication, symptoms of insanity
I’m having treatments as we speak
No this is not metaphoric this is more like metamorphic, I get hype, upset then morbid, I just had
Some morphine, and I’m forfeiting my title
I just played the Biggie song with the thoughts suicidal
Twelve times in succession
Vic said switch professions, I applied at UPS and they was asking for a test
To check my
Urination, urination? I was pissed
I’m the nation’s greatest rapper
On the unknown rapper list shit
Shit
I’m not in love with violence
But I dream of catching bodies
I keep watching Shutter Island
I be
F–king smiling like the joker do
Punchline rhymes where I might throw a joke or two
‘Sposed to be a joke on you, mostly though the jokes on me
First name is ‘Hopefully’
Last name ‘You notice me’
My ex girl told me that she’s still not over me
While I was up under her, something’s in her ovaries
It’s not mine
..I be in places I don’t plan to be
Can it be

The hurt little boy
Is searching for the man in me
Can it be

I’m sorry yall
I’m ‘sposed to stop apologizing but these split personalities be gradually arising
Stimuli be on that blah blah I’m nice, I’m hot I’m fire
Sha is cocky but cordial, spits sick, looks tired
Then Sherod wants to stay at home, still be a writer
But he has fantasies about sparking up his lighter
And then burning all his furniture, computer and his tv
Leaving all of his possessions thinking he don’t really need ‘em
And when those three guys come together for a meeting
I can see why you might not know what I be meaning
You don’t see it when you turn insane
Like that straight road switched into a turning lane
And now I’m lost
Lotta rappers thought that serving cane
Or maybe saying that you dabbled in the murder game
Was the answer
Well for me all I heard was Kane
In my head and Rakim made me burn the stage
I did my dirt but the dirt lead to hurt and pain
Had me writing daily trying to turn words to fame
Am I there?
I’m just trying to be the illest
Y’all staring asking what you talking bout Willis
I turned to drugs
I was on that Todd Bridges
So I had to quit the smoking, rather die of different strokes, than losing doe and living broke but
Yo …rest in peace to Gary Coleman
Mrs. Garrett had me rolling..the facts of life are
There’s so much pressure that they handing me
Can it be
Can it be
Can it be insanity?
I’m rapidly rapping deep and landing 3 stories off the canopy, with a bag of trees, oh I hope you catching me
Can it be insanity thinking that this chip that’s on my shoulder isn’t showing I got older now my soul is my controller
Holy roller I am not but you know I told my foes that I would not just break the mold, I would
Stomp a fucking hole
Into the box you try to fit me in
Ok I reloaded I’m unloading, then exploding then exposing what I know
Can it be
Insanity to wake up happily?
My money’s kinda funny and it laughs at me
But I don’t laugh back at he or back at she
Money is a bitch, and if my salary gains calories and
Makes my wallet thick, am I rich?
Am I special? I be changing like the weather
Is it nuts to say my album’s hot, next one will be better?
And my mixtapes had their moments
Gotta get my beats together, and my hooks could use some work
Yea my friends say I’m a jerk
And my fans say it’s hard to be a fan of me
Cause I don’t have a gimmick and I’m deep and they can’t dance to me
Can it be can it be can I be the antifreeze to make your system hot?
No, cold yo I’m mad at me
Damnit B I cannot sleep
No bitch I cannot creep

Better man
Fucked up my grammar be
Wonder can my grandma see
Hope I make you proud
Engineer this is a banging beat, can you make me loud?
Thanks a lot, now I hear myself, man that’s how I sound?
This is wack, if I flow too much I’ll drown, that’s profound
I get down, now I’m up, something brown’s in my cup

Then come home just knowing everything would be okay

And the scars on my arms are all that I have
To show the good side of bad
And I just think of everything that's on my mind
It's a messed up world, but if you're living it's fine
Positivity's key, but for me that's hard to do
Especiallly when I'm involved with you
Where the hell am I at? I just wonder where'd the rap fans go

And it's hard as a person when you're tryna advance

And all my righteousness goes wrong
But I was doing so well
My dreams to be a Godly man
Seem out of reach of my own hand
But where I fall short, His grace still stands
If I have faith like a child

And if Monday's child is fair of face
And Tuesday's child is full of grace
Then you can call me a Tuesday's child
Like Wednesday's child, I'm full of woe
And Thursday's child I've got far to go
But you can call me a Tuesday's child

Sounds too easy some might say
There's a bigger price to pay
But when Jesus gave His life away
It was once and for all
So, with more of His grace filling me
I more than ever want to be
Growing up in purity
With the faith of a child

And if Monday's child is fair of face

I let my feet fall from four forty stories
Onto a platform of solder and steam

Stretching out your calves, doing some jumping jacks

Skin would glisten like reflections off the blueish Jag
She had a Jewish dad, and a Jamaican maid
Started hanging with strippers and dropping the zippers
And selling the pussy for paper to play
Crusty feet like she hiking for days and live in the mountains
At the park she piss in the fountain, shit on the Michigan towel
She quick to split up an owl
She loves some dick in her bowels
Dabble in crystal, polish the pistol, powder her sniffles with flour
Straight flieshman
In the private part of her pussy pocket
Randomly pussy farting
Sold at the hookers auction
Left as a crooked orphan
Wrapped in the sports section
Box score, fake black rubber cock in the top drawer, what

Laid a towel cause I fucked you on your period
Stole my mothers car crashed it by the Burger King
Young love, but we thought it was eternity
Raw sex – never thought about paternity
But now this cunt is trying to murder me
Abusing me physically and verbally
Said my dick was too small
I went and got the surgery, just to show it off
This ain't real shit, baby, I'm just going off
Clear the mind, fuck it, so I wrote a song
Night life, I'm destined for the bright lights
Knife fights at the bar with some white dykes
She hold me down, break a bottle on the bitch head
.25 out the pussy and it spits lead
We always end up in a situation
She throwing diapers out the window at me
Called the cops said I beat her face
Beat the case, now I shiver at a sweet embrace

And ain't say nothing?”
I bit until my tongue gushed
I couldn't say 'I I—'
Huh? I ain't say nothing
I ain't say nothing
Get so paranoid
I ain't see nothing…
[Verse 2]
I used to play tough with the cops, had ideas
Told my girl who protest hold me a spot, and I'll go
Black folk know what talking white means, but still
Hold two open hands up in the sky, finger quotes
In my gangly youth my limbs used to swing like Polo tees
Mazal tov, still pop a bottle like what Puff did Steve
If you can't tote your own weight then what's this buff shit even ‘bout?
Crystals in your lil' feet, that's all that dust protein
Swoop Tremaine from Calabasas in a Brit sports car
We used to cypher in Marc Jacobs, had the library card
At Scott's comparing the silver spoons to plastic knives and sporks
I was the dog breathless chasing the car up the street
If I ever catch it I'll panic, that's the flaw in me
Nothing glamorous about growing up poor and naïve
Standing on the balls of my feet, trying to pray before I sleep

[Chorus]
Selling like red light pussy
Gotta waterfall douche it
Level head on the cushion
Light pink I'm revving
Light green, I'm someone like you, someone like me
Ring finger might sure get tooken
Wrist like springs, natural springs, water green indoor cookie
Other than me and you, ain't nobody else coming between, the glue stuck
We got the camera on Monday
We made a movie on Tuesday, fuck
We got the look, get looks
They never seen stars, the city too bright
Bright, bright, bright, bright

[Verse 3]
I try to sleep, can't get a lot
Make dreams bleed into days
The pressure couldn't stop
The bleeding I started seeing things
Watching out for demons
Blocked him like a screen, these plays
I was always reading, yeah
Then some hair grew where the sun don't shine
And I started feeling like pussy popping was the paradigm
Getting my dick wet, maritime
Lying on my virgin, Jergens moisturized
Gee whiz, gee whiz, gee whiz
All my friends is so, “No homo”
Blaze to trail behind
No heroes in front of mind
Just rappers who'd evolve with time
Looked up to them, knew all the rhymes
But at that time they enforced a bias
You know like some cops stop and frisk a guy
‘Cause he's brown, so of course he sides
With all the gangs these lames is extorted by
Switch lanes in the Porsche I drive
Let the police Ford Explorer by
Sirens screaming like they four or five
Throwing tantrums on the 405
Still on the whey like I'm tryna gain
Don't hibernate in the winter, that's where summer bodies are made
Just leg days like a sprinter
With the Bryan Baby blue interior
Big B's like GMO's
And they sting when my eyes close
All I see when my eyes close
Blame my emo on time zones
It's the same but different
Sets, twin siblings, head spinning
Exorcist

[Chorus]
Selling like red light pussy
Gotta waterfall douche it
Level head on the cushion
Light pink I'm revving
Light green, I'm someone like you, someone like me

Speaking of God, at ten years old, I switched church homes
The bishop was tweaking, and we was Baptist
So how you a bishop? Like technically speaking
You drove a white Rolls, me and my family was type broke
The difference between having a home and not having a home was a tightrope
Visiting Catholic Churches, the masses was quiet as mice so
The minister spoke with no microphone
They had no choir, so silent I thought I heard Christ go
'You need a messiah'
Ran out the house from hormones, you seven months pregnant with Ryan
I figured I'd go to the East by my T for some peace and quiet
I ended up running the streets with my cousins, sitting in the back
Listening to beats, scheming on schemes that came to pass
They strategy murder yourselves, don't fall according to stats
I pray the new plots clear and thick as bulletproof glass
Cause the worst part of death is ambitions are dashed
Keep speaking death, it'll start to seem like the new car you wanna buy
It starts popping up on your way to work, see it all the time, always passing by
Call it playing Beetle-bug, yeah, it's on sight, better throw a punch
Running late to Teterboro, made the plane wait because it's no rush

[Verse 1: Mela Machinko]
Boy, you got me knocked out, laid up, love sick over your love
You got me wondering what the hell I was thinking of
When I was pushing you away with my silly games
And all the while you were trying to say I should have some faith
And now boy, boy, boy
You got me calling your name, you got me screaming your name
I'm like boy

[Hook]
Oh boy, love is what you gave me (oh boy)
Oh boy (oh boy), why can't you forgive me
I've changed (I've changed), you'll see it's true
I'm sorry, now I'm being cool

[Verse 2: Mela Machinko]
Boy, I got you messed up by these lame ducks that's running around
And so I couldn't see how I hurt the good man I found
You are a blessing and the best thing to come to my life
And it's a shame that it took me so long to realize
I couldn't put my trust in you cause I was afraid
And now I'm begging and I'm praying it's not too late
I'm like boy, boy, boy
You got me calling your name, you got me screaming your name
I'm like boy

[Verse 3: Median]
So cool lady boo, you are too crazy
Peep the new you, errr, what you been doing lately
Me, I've been maintaining, doing my thing
Though the sunshines but now you had me dancing in the rain
With me being confused with all your dubious ways
Or was it jealousy that fueled all your dubious games
My first thought, she's too cute, I stuck around and played
Fast forward, she's a cuckoo, I had to step away
And regroup the pieces of my sacrifice and change
Cause you can't change a person, they have to see the game
And you just couldn't see it, blinded by my freedom
Girlfriends in your earpiece saying you shouldn't be with him
Had you think-thinking I was cheating
Following the lead of their misery, you should have been the leader
And held me down like 9th on the wheels of the True School
Lady we are too through, now you're being cuckoo

[Bridge: Mela Machinko]
Ooooooh (oh boy, I've changed)
I'm being cool now (and I swear)
I'm being coo-oo-oo-oo-ool (and I swear, and I swear baby)

I only brought joy to the underpaid
Your website rating was under 8
Well fuck the numbers, I want reactions
Ive fought the power, I'm multi-facet
A trip to the Grammys they calling me classic. I ordered my suit in an orderly fashion
It took two years to create my shit

And still went and got her masters
2 jobs so the rent was paid. And I quit school tryna be a rapper
Underground slave tryna keep his masters
Momma dead prayed tryna make it happen
And I can't say I don't believe in that
But I will say that I worked my ass off
Waited for the day I could take the backdoor
Never had the key had to break the latch off
Ducking the federali attacks with a bat in a backpack if they unattach attack dogs
Very last steps of a fallen man
A&Rs giving me the song and dance
How I'm gone tell mom dukes I failed

Impuissant face à l'horreur, les gouvernements sont des tueurs
Je milite pour mes proches, au moins eux je peux les sauver

Ma life est d'humeur palestinienne, bien avant toi, d'puis ""Destinée""

He was waitin' for the bus in his army greens
Sat down in a booth in a cafe there
Gave his order to a girl with a bow in her hair

[Verse 2]
He's a little shy so she give him a smile
And he said, ""Would you mind sittin' down for a while
And talkin' to me? I'm feelin' a little low""
She said ""I'm off in an hour and I know where we can go""

[Verse 3]
So they went down and they sat on the pier
He said ""I bet you got a boyfriend, but I don't care
I got no one, to send a letter to
Would you mind if I sent a-one back here to you?""

[Chorus]
I cried
Never gonna hold the hand of another guy
""Too young for him,"" they told her

It's Like this
Just a couple of boys
Chillin' out in the studio, making some noise
For all the snapbacking bitches and witches in stitches
Baby delicious, a rapper's delight, it's nutritious

Just H in the corner, caleb is smaller, j burke is taller
But it don't matter to me, cause i got self-esteem, floating out from my ears to my denim jeans

Which i coincidentally don't wear, reppin' the black pants, big jumpers, messy hair

Taking it steady with the girls in my life, two sisters one mother and my catey that's right

Yo it's passionate, just one of those great relationship, though i'm leaving for 2 weeks on a foreign trip, but that don't test me, our foundations are stronger than jessie

Verse 2 (I):

Here's the sitch. I was only a kid, rolling joints with j-burke in sheila's kip, nothing stronger than a friendship built on bong hits, shoutout to catey, i was swallowing it

If you know what I mean, it's obscene and that's true, she was handling balls like my boy babe ruth. if there's one thing stronger than the sex life, it's the relationship - she gonna be your wife

Away in france, learning linguistics, the positive response is an overwhelming statistic. It's ballistic, hits that girl like cricket. Buzz-easy (?) though, loving not dismissive

Relationship is great, she always misses him. start of something big like when jesus was christened. hair looks great with no effort put in, me hugo and HC agree that it's banging

You could tell I'm smiling when I write and I'm thinking 'bout her
All the blues lose a little color when I'm thinking 'bout her
All the little things that she does keep me up
Night's occupied with her presence in a cup
Filled to the brim with a wink and a smile
These small thoughts that I wrestle for a while
Thinking 'bout her
I was thinking 'bout me
I was thinking 'bout us
I was trying to gain trust
Play it cool
Stay friends
Keep it up
Pretend
Go for the gold
Have a story to be told
Situations in my mind what'll play out
Ask her on a date or be consumed by doubt
The small details that I need to figure out
But I'm done playing safe I think I've found my route

But I think I'll always be better with you

This game is tough and I’m working up a good sweat, Jet set
Just give me all your eyes and ears and pay attention to the way it appears, or how it’s mentioned

Then Mommy says ""Okay, that's quite enough
Now it's time to get into the tub!""
(Oh man, do I have to?)

You take your Halloween costume off
Dip your big toe in, is it warm enough?
Look in the water, something bubbles up
Could it be the creature from the tub?

Clammy and slimy, gooey, yucky, grimy
Icky and sticky, hope it doesn't lick me
Wobbly, runny, ""Mommy, it's not funny""
Watch out for the creature from the tub!

Maybe it slithered up the open drain
And now it's hiding 'neath my rubber ducky
You say it's nothing, but I hear blub, blub
Watch out for the creature from the tub!

But I can't help but feel like I should be here singing
I'd rather die than see the day they prove me wrong

And lately I talk to your memory
More than I should
If I could just forget the past I would
Because this missing you aren't doing me no good

I'm so close to crazy
Right on the edge
Just one step away from going insane
But I'm not there yet
If I could just lose my mind
I wouldn't know we're through
But this close to crazy
Is far from over you

This afternoon I caught myself
Reliving how it used to be
At a table for two just you and me
But talking to an empty chair
And laughing right out loud
Turned everybody's head and left no doubt

I was sick of flippin' channels and sick of flippin' quarters
I called my man Zulu said, ""Meet me on the corner
Maybe we can check out the clubs in the city
Because waitin' at the crib can make you feel shitty""
So he hopped into my ride on the squeaky doorside and
We hit the Upper Room where they keep the funk alive
The man at the door invited us inside
He said there isn't any cover if you're keepin' up the vibe
We took it upstairs to big up the area
The people in the house was shakin' up their derriere
Raisin up their hands and raisin up their voices
Tokes was the DJ I was happy with his choices
Maxin' and mixin' the beats they was fixin'
My brain like a smoke that was doubly, triply, dope
The decadence is gone and life may never be the same
Cause when the beat hits you feel no pain!
(chorus)

So a piece of peace for you, a piece of peace for me
A piece of peace for every peaceful person that you see
I said a piece of peace for you, a piece of peace for me
But I don't act peaceful if you're not that way to me

So fuck the police! we can keep the peace!
We can make love and conquer that disease
Because nothing in the world is impossible to me
I can swim on dry land and run upon the sea
And nothing in the world is impossible to me
You can chop off my legs and I'll land upon my feet
I turn it over to the spirit, I leave her in charge
My favorite record sounds like an African Head Charge
She'll beat up the beats with and eggbeater pour em in the batter
She'll make 'em sound fatter and fatter
Cause food for the soul is the flavor of the music
Spice for the brain is the essence of the lyrics
Songs can be delicious and also be nutritious
You can't pay for culture"", it can only be experienced
BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!

Graffiti on the street for everyone to see
Even the elders in the house was havin' fun
Because we livin' life at the top of our lungs

I get giddy when I see a energy tank

I don't know which road to turn down
I don't know which path to take
Cause every time I try to turn around
There's just another path to face
So tell me how I'm gonna get through this
When everything is falling apart
I tried too many times to find the light
But I'm only getting cought in the dark

Verse 1 [DicE]:
I stall and stop, get out and run
No destination or where I'm from
My heart is cold, my mind is lost
Thoughts of my past and all the loss
My father gone, my brother caged
My mother struggles, I'm full of hate
I was engaged, she broke my heart
I'm left alone, left in the dark
You couldn't handle what I've went through
""Dice is crazy, said he hates me, hurt my feelings""
And I meant to, I won't mend you
Won't be nice to you and no I won't pretend to

Pull out like 2 9’s and I aim it dead at they eyes

The shit coming through, silver-back monkey at zoo
Bananas, I've been really forreally like a milli leroux

It’s like lyrically Big and Pac, man if they friendship was cool
Motherfucking jams we making until the skies turn blue

Lookin' down, word to Nate Dogg, and all dog pounds they he peep

I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

[Verse 1]
And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you

Then we broke each other's hearts

Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway

No one knows how much I miss you

3241,602924,Save Me,Ovadia,en,rap,"Have you ever wondered why you're here?
Why we're here?
If life has a point beyond the nine-to-five and an ice cold beer?
I don't know, I don't know, maybe I'm thinking too much
But I know, I know, that my soul is out of touch
Is this just survival, making it day to day
Or is today just another way of saying yesterday tomorrow?
Is there something beyond this sorrow?
Something on the other side?
Is there another side?
I feel like I've been lied to
But maybe I'm the one telling the lies
Try, try, sigh, sigh, cry, cry, die, die
Is that the pattern of life's lines?
No lifeline that makes this life shine?
I shy from that picture of a lifetime
Cause my life's mine
""Myself!"" it cries
""Myself"" it tries
I'm selfish, I know
But I tried;
At least I tried
And maybe that's all that needs to be done before I die

[Chorus]
Save me! Not because I'm dying, because I don't know how to live!
Save me! Not because I'm running, but because I'm standing still!
Save me! Not because I'm failing, but because I can't even start!
Save me! Save me! Save me! I don't know where to go!

Open my eyes and shower
Go to work and watch the hours tick by

And this is my life!
With no end in sight

But there’s no one to fight!
I envy the man that knows he would lay down his life;
I wish I had that kind of conviction and might
But when I lay down at night
Turn out the light
I find my soul contrite
For sins unknown, and bound by shackles tight
And dreams bring no reprieve
Night terrors offer no relief
I wish you knew what I was goin’ through
I wish I could let you see
See me seized by this deceit
When I believe
That life’s as pointless as it seems
As pointless as these dreams
I wish you could hear me scream
Even when I seem fine
I wish you could see me weep
Right before I drift to sleep
Everyday I do the same thing:
Open my eyes and shower
Go to work  and watch the hours tick by
Just to get by

Walkin through your hoods

With my mask and my horns
Ready to take you for your goods
Sympothetical never could of been

Never kept me sacred

While you're sleepin wit the fish

There's the real and there's the phony
They go through many changes
Go through many stages
Still remain raw when the law put me in cages
Many faces livin by the sword
They try to plead their cases
Cause they say they found the lord
Jesus, I got so many reasons
Fools tryin to read ya, full of amnesia
Fakin all the funk wit the Bible in thier palms
But these bitch made punks all belong up in a trunk

[Verse]
Break the chains, set a nigga free
Let me off parole let a nigga be
Cops on patrol, I guess they patrolling for me
They want my soul, but I don't never keep it on me
It's in a place that most are forbidden
But anyplace is cool that's far away from prison
Alice In Chains and my heart is too
If your heart's in the same place, mine goes out to you
And when the clock strikes two, tell you what I'm gonna do
When it hits three, you know where I'm gonna be
When it hits four, you know I'm out the door
When it hits five I pray to God I'm still alive
Even though I'm going all out, yea I'm ready to die
Pullin pistols in the church in the omens of my enemies eyes
Get the sticks buck 'em
Fuck 'em, if there's nothing left then freedom then nothing

So here we, here we (Go!)
Turn it up a notch, turn it up a lot
I'm burning up your blocks like a pot full of legos
Drop it like it's fuego in a hasta luego
Pasta and prego, pasta alfredo
In the cockpit of a rocket
With a pocket full of pesos
Blaze shows make the crowd say (Oh!)

Transparent; the rest are all see-through
We complex; we vex when we don't mean to
I'm in the fucking house; you got to lean to
And if you follow me I'll give you real shit to tweet to
You bring the drama like Landon Donovan

No hollering, I'm talking to grown ups
Ipecac in the phalanges, the hands get thrown up
Yeah, I'm like a singer man, I got this sewn up
Like a cop who split his pants eating too much donuts
You got cake, that's great, but so what?

No fraud those fakes are just blowhards
All bark, no bite, they got no jaws
I rich strife the mic and pay homage

Raised in my spaceship
295 on the parkway
Broke down, now I move crowds like The Marchay
Flow's so butter, can't believe it's not Parkay
I get space, I get played like a card game

Eh, spew's sicker than the BP-Spill
No bifocals needed just to see we ill
Wrap it up, doggybag, let me see that bill

People getting bullies back as if its retribution, wrong people get the death sentence so then they tie the noose and
Drop like bombs or maybe a plane to the sea, government is still the nations enemy
But later they don't give a fuck and say tax season is coming up
And instead of being consistent, these people push their luck
National tragedies happen almost every two months, government acting like they don't know what to do and such
Families don't get to see their veteran enough, life without them feels even more tough
Then what the soldiers do, and truly I'm hoping to
Stop this oil war because what they say it is isn't true
Poverty strikes this world but does the upper class care? It's like saying thank you to a father that wasn't there
The upper class will under the revolution, fuck your chandelier I'm going to cause contusions
And we the underground is no longer underneath, and kids with a future are off the streets
Once for a moment people put down the leaf, histories days will stop their repeat
Think about it. Past thing have been coming back, as if time machines have been set on attack
Columbine and Virginia tech, is aurora and Connecticut
Bad president that salutes fake truth above his neck
I pray nothing to drastic come from the past tense, like bombs, hurricane, and the injustice madness
Even though no one is still equal, your not the same among other people
So is no one equal? Is anyone safe?
Should we all just go back to living in caves?
Should we all go backwards to save us from the fall?
Funny thing is we going backwards now if we don't act all

I hope we don't fall back into another bad presidential era, Reagan's is still in effect and it might be that way forever
We're walking backwards forward back to world war 2, holocaust doesn't have to facing again the Jews
But some people wouldn't worry if it was a different race, so I tell them how about I crucify you and put you in a cave for two days
I'm for sure you'll still be there rotting as a corpse and of course in the end ill apologize for using brute force

Outrside you window, hello
I'm over you, I'm over you
My prayers have been answered, my dreams have come true
After long years of tryin' and gradually dying
Right now I'm over you
I kept on believing you'd come back
But I've spent my last night alone
Oh, I see you sleeping and soon you'll be weeping
When they call and they tell you I'm gone
So I think I'll just keep on wanting you
Up into the cool morning sky
I wish you complete happiness
I forgoive you, God be with you, goodbye

She don't talk about religion, she talks about the Stones

And her heartbeat is a rhythm that commands her every word

Her smile's a world of sunrise and cries to make it rain
And she hides the truth discretely, but you'd have to take her word

""That bad girl down the street should be run from our midst

Known be a trouble maker not a faker
Throw you head first from the biggest sky scrapper
Take a plunge straight to your death
I'll burn you with the right
And I chop you with the left

And never in my life will I ever let it get to me

Because I'm afraid our amazing relationship might only be just a thing i made up
All in my head? Or is it a vision? We can turn dream into thing if you wish it..too..
Missing you, when my eyes are open I am frozen, when you look at me your eyes are
Beautiful blue, like skies and oceans, my explosions of thoughts of you as I write these notes

And my emotions pour out, its a war now, i waste more hours. No real goal but I'm still thinkin
No pillows, and I'm still dreamin

{Hook}- Nervous men live worthless endless dreams and
Lonely women only give in in dreams and
All you've been was flawless in my dreams and theres
Words I'd say but cursed to stay in dreamin

{verse 2}
Usually not this nervous, that last dream seemed worth it

Cuz in that dream my nerdiness wasn't a burden and too weird too flirt with
And these verses? feel worhtless. Probably still wouldn't talk if you heard this
But recurring diversions of only one person somehow gotta have a purpose. (right?)

And on Saturday nights there was a radio show and she would sing along
And I'll never forget her face when she revealed to me
That she'd dreamed about singing at The Grand Ol' Opry

Her eyes, oh, how they sparkled when she sang those songs
While she was hanging the clothes on the line, I was a kid just a hummin' along
Well, I'd be playing in the grass to her what might've seemed, obliviously
But there ain't no doubt about it, she sure made her mark on me

An' she played old gospel records on the phonograph
She turned them up loud and we'd sing along but those days have passed
Just now that I am older it occurs to me
That I was singing in the grandest opry

Pon cock, the Don Juan Doc
Send crews back to the shoeshine box, connect the dots

I make it hard for MCs to run neck and elbow
With D-O, penal code, Deebo knows
To duck when he hear the bike with the squeaky clutch
Swallow this hard act to follow
You could parachute off my slang and use my rhymes to toggle
I'm tense, so smooth I can't be fingerprinted
I stomp harder in slow motion (Den-den, den-den-den)
Yo, fuck your applaud, bitches still rush me
Like they rushed the store before Soul Train Awards
Incorporate a law, whoever ain't raw get they hand chopped
By Jamal with the Wu sword (Ooh-whee)
My crew specialize in snakin' your bitch
Robbin' you while you on the floor, shakin' and shit
I'm doin' me, now do you (Yo, who you?), Doc
I bomb shit 'til the conflict's crucial, I
Be the Black El Niño, I mean, yo, I'm supreme
Like the team show, what you paid your cream for
(To see us sit down?) Yo, nah, we get the fuck up
(And leave the one you with) Then take her from Usher
That's right, six-double-o with chrome pipes

Fully automatic word spray, hold 'em at bay

Check it, darts fly through the air—hit the MC
I lay 'em all out, till my clip is empty
No one can take the hate from the Clan
We execute, carry out the plan
My pen glides across the paper, like skates on ice
Makin' rappers think twice
You don't want to enter this deadly chamber
Even on the same track, you still a stranger
Just the thought, raise the hair on your skin
And once you step in, you feel the forceful winds

I want to hide away in the back of a cave
At the top of a mountain where no one can hear me
And no one can see me so I don't have to deal with them

'Cause relationships are overrated
Maybe I'm just tired and jaded

And always have a homie
They never showed me the brighter side
I always had to find it
They find me feeling fine
Like I put that shit behind me
But really on some real shit that shit was  right be side me
Who put that shit beside me
That's probably
One way at looking at it
Two ways to feeling better
Better get the fuck over it
Or over you will be forever
Climbing these topless ladder
Dodging some bitch that's topless
To top it off I finally I got a top to top
The bottles I was filling
Done fell over fuck these feelings
Not humbled Q. be the realest

Middle finger sent from the heavens
Yo I haven't found the reason

Why please someone who don't give fuck about you

I had a plan if I was the man, I'd pro the jects
Lay it low and leg mad cassettes
I unconditioned my ways of the everyday sunset
Wagin' my days to the one bet
'Cause your breaks'll have the carrot of cakes, whether mine
Out of line, I breeze into the early mornin'
Freak the WIC call and get a tap on my shoulder
'Cause the days of the breaks be just about over
The arts of the six won't play my bag of tricks
I got the sevens in my pocket somewhere
Reasons for the Cheer All Temperature here
I keep it to the rear, and then I'm exploding
[Verse 3: Posdnuos]
I be the fab, I be the fabulous but see, unlike the Chi
I got the flea up in the name (ah one two, ah one two)
Can't no one bend my cousin from the Peter Piper like the others
Latchin' on to when I caught the fame (ah one two, ah one two)
Pass the task to ask me 'bout the Native Tongue again, my friend
I tell you, Jungle Brothers On the Run (ah one two, ah one two)
I've shaken hands with many devils in the industry
Believe the Genesis like Phil with stills mean that I'm def
Like the autographs, I'm signed until the break

[Chorus: Posdnuos + Smokey Robinson]
Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two
Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two
Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two
Breakadawn, breakadawn
Ah one two, ah one two

[Verse 4: Dove]
We in the mornin', after, and, but in the end I be the is
'Cause in the midst, man, it's alright
Momma got the book into my day-life
My pops got the belt, so best believe we sail the wave
To the Long I laid the anchor in the 'Ville
And how I relate, I stay inside of my gates
Break days mess up my mind, ground zero degrees
And the weather feels fine
You opened my eyes man, thought I had a man
But how could I eye-scan, I wasn't around
I seen the states and played the dates in the far-far
Gathered the new, from the zoas around
Grew old with Mikey Rodes and played the codes
Sometimes I don't budge, without my cous' Fuzz
A simple, ""How ya do?"" Ah check it from my friends and my crew
Makes it definitely special
[Verse 5: Posdnuos]
Now there's no Shiny Happy People in the crew, we play the rough
I got the huff, and puff, to blow the house low
You know the never-ending factor while I'm on, so tell a squid
I know an Enterprising brother, so report to the bridge
I bounce a ball with my left, a squid with my right
('Cause a squid is just a punk) Yo, he deserved to lose the fight
I might meander 'cross your dream, travellin' up the stream
Plug Wonder Wonder Why you're lonely tonight
We see the girls scream as if we're shocked by the live shell
Let's round 'em up and get 'em back to the hotel
Motel, holiday, inn-fact
I'm gonna let you know, once again, that De La Soul
Is sure to show you we will hit the charter harder

That you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'mma be here for a while just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you could fight, we always making them duck or die

Throw me on a New York fitted while reppin' like I'm a Yankee
If they wanna front then I hit em and I tap em
Eat a nigga's food like its a scampi
When it come to bitch niggas, I'm a little bit a racist
Governor Pataki Papi, here to massacre aunti
Now pops was a little bit manly, fuck all that aiming

Organs in your drawers now you wearing your pants saggy
Haggling niggas with scriptures I'm spittin, you should be happy
Gradually when I hit you I split you and leave you sadly
In a situation lay you out flatter than chicken patties

When I got my first guitar my fingers bled until I learned a chord or two
I pulled on my aran sweater, wrote my Ma a goodbye letter
And started throwing shapes in O'Donoghue's

I played cabaret in Bundoran, marquees for Father Horan
And I once stood in for Johnny McEvoy
From Berlin to San Francisco I've gone on before the disco
Lashing out the four green fields of Athenry
Mountbellew was like purgatory but Tulsk was just like being in hell
I've received my education in the lounges of the nation
After 25 years I am doing well

If I get an encore I go home feeling like a king
It's a two way situation I get a lot of pleasure when I sing

I've played every lounge in Ireland from Dingle right up to Donegal
I've sung Nancy Spain on stages
Where no other ballad singers play at all
From the rising sun in Brownstown to the Blue Lagoon above in Sligo Town
Ballymurphy and the Bogside, Ballinamore
And even once in Ballinasloe

I was playing in the Meeting place when half the Special Branch came in the door
They were looking for an outlaw
He stole their trousers back in 1984
They started listening to my songs and hung around till after the show
If I ever need a taxi plate or a massage at a special rate

Blue cup, black gun
Paid dues, that's done
Favors from me, can't ask none
Black eyed the game and got passed on
Me, I kept this shit super solid
Came up, and nigga you acknowledge
See me in my coupe, I got stupid dollars
I'm a dropout but now I speak at colleges
Ironic, I'm honest
I get paid to speak my mind, and it's crazy to me
Just pay me, fooly; if I wrote a script, it'd be a crazy movie
About my life, about rolling dice
About taking risks, you gotta know the price
Gotta know yourself, on the coldest nights
Can't turn it down, you gotta own the fight
Win, lose, or draw, you could ball
You could've kept it real, but nigga, you's a fraud
Before you get the shit, you gotta lose it all
And then you find yourself and see that you's a God
And that's real shit, thousand hundred dollar bill shit
From hood to the hills shit, like, ""How the fuck did we build this?""
Real shit, look
Blue cup, black gun
Paid dues, that's done
Favors from me, can't ask none
Came in the game then I passed up

Sometimes I get so offended by it
Don't compare me to none of these fuckin' liars

Dropped seven tapes wit' no fuckin' filler

Remember at the start, we had the world by the tail
Seems like nothing we two could try just ever could fail
Then the lovin' slipped away and you stood by and you just let it
Someday I know that you'll regret it
When they send that pain on back to you
The lovin' fires burned cold, with only ashes left behind
Guess your kisses made me blind
Cause then the magic disappeared and
You stood by and you just let it
Someday I know that you'll regret it
When someone else goes and steps all over you

I got a feeling called the blues, oh Lord
Since my baby said goodbye
I don't know what I'll do
All I do is sat and sigh, ""Oh Lord""
The last long day she said goodbye
Oh, Lord, I thought I would die
She'll do you, she'll do me, she's got that kind of loving
Lord, I love to hear her when she calls me sweet daddy
Such a beautiful dream
I hate to think it's all over, I've lost my heart it seems
I've grown so used to you somehow
But I'm nobody's sugar daddy now
And I'm lonesome, I got the lovesick blues

I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
That's what's the matter with me
I'm in love, I'm in love with a beautiful gal
But she don't care about me
Well, I tried and I tried to keep her satisfied
But she just wouldn't stay
Now that she is leaving this is all I can say

It was right before the crash
We got thrashed throughout the '30s
Queuing up for soup with scabby sores
Then they sent us off to war

We came back in the '40s
And there were wheelchairs, guns and ticker-tape
We poured it on the floor
And we made love to the interstates
We got shiftless in the '50s
Holding hands and going steady
Twisting into dark parts
Of the large Midwestern cities
Tripped right through the '60s
With some blissful little hippie
Some Kennedys got shot
While you were screwing San Francisco
And the '70s got heavy
We woke up on bloody carpets
Got tangled up in gas lines
And I guess that's where it started

The '80s almost killed me

2858,436383,Rap Critic Reviews: “21 Questions” by 50 Cent feat. Nate Dogg,Rap Critic,en,rap,"
When asked by Dr. Dre: ""How you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on?""

50 Cent responded with: I’m two people. I’ve always had to be two people since I was a kid, to get by. To me that’s not diversity, it’s necessity

And you know what, I can get behind that, that's the dichotomy of man. you DO have your moments of anger, and you do have your softer sides. You can talk about wanting to kill at one point, and talk about wanting to be loved the next… well, wait a minute, if that's true, Mr. I'm so enlightened to the different aspects of humanity, why did you rag on Ja Rule so much when HE made love songs? What is HE not allowed to have his own dichotomy? That seems a little unfair. Reminds me of when he was in that whole thing with Kanye West, where he was a total sore loser about not selling as many records as Kanye, and decided to randomly taunt him for years, especially for using auto tune *audio clip of ""I Line Niggas', immediately followed by 50 performing ""Love Lockdown""*, but then, wait, what was that song he did the next year with G-Unit?

*""Rider, Part 2""*

Oh yeah, yeah…

So you see, my thing about 50 Cent is that he's always come off as a bit of a hypocritical bully, and with other rappers that I might like, yeah, they may be jackasses, but they do something that makes me look past it, like, yeah, Eminem's an ass, but dammit, he sure knows how to combine lyrics and flow to create masterful verses, and yeah, Kanye's an ass, but dammit, he sure does know how to make good beats and throw in a little socially conscious messages every now and then. But 50 Cent? Yeah, he's an ass, but he sure does, uh… spit typical gangsta rap lyrics over dark beats, because… THAT'S what everyone was waiting for!

But i dunno, if one of my favorite rappers of all time signed him, maybe I should give him a chance. After all, it's not just making a ""thugs need love too"" song that makes me not like a song, it's making a BAD song that makes me not like one, so let's check out ""21 Questions"" by 50 cent, and see how it fares

*intro*

Oh yes, but first we must have awkwardly rushed character establishment. Okay, so how do we establish a rapport between two people in in love in only 20 seconds?

*50 kisses money, laughs, girl in the back laughs*

*Laugh* Yes, I echo your thoughts concerning the hilarity of money

*police arrive*
You might also likeOh no, the cops! Maybe making all those songs in which I publicly admit to selling crack wasn't such a good idea!

*cops come in, song starts*

*video shows 50 riding in the back of an cop van*

""New York City! You are now riding… with 50 Cent!

Well, according to this video, you're riding in the back of a cop van. I wouldn't exactly call that your finest hour

You gotta love it!

Personally, I think riding in the back of a police vehicle kind of sucks, but whatever

I just want to chill and twist the lye
Catch stunts in my 745

I just wanna let you know before this love song starts that I'm still totally a gangsta by smoking weed and showing off my expensive cars!

Girl, it's easy to love me now

And, of course, 10 points for including the closest thing the new millennium will ever get to Isaac Hayes, Mr. Nate Dogg on the hook

Would you love me if I was down and out?
Would you still have love for me?
And I gotta give this song a few more points for actually being about something other than the general theme of ""i'm a thug, and you're my main bitch"". Instead of just that, it centers around a sense of doubt about his girlfriend's faithfulness that understandably stems from being really famous and having people around you that only care about you because of your money. He wants someone who's interested in more than money… despite what the intro may lead you to believe

If I fell off tomorrow would you still love me?

And he starts off by asking directly: if all of his fame was over tomorrow, would you still care about him? It's straight up and to the point. And I wish he would have started with this instead of the ""riding in my car, smoking weed"" nonsense

If I got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century
Could I count on you to be there to support me mentally?

You know, for most ""thugs need love too"" songs, they only dwell on a surface level depiction of a relationship, but to ask someone if they'd be willing to be emotional support if they were in jail for 25 years, that requires some reflection. And the delivery makes me feel like it really means something when he says it

If I was hit and I was hurt would you be by my side?

Also, factoring in the realization that this man has actually been shot at 9 times, this is an alarmingly real possibility he's giving this girl to think about

If it was time to put in work would you be down to ride?

Okay, that's kinda vague. You might want to elaborate what you mean, because, you know, one might confuse...

I get out and peel a nigga cap, chill and drive

Okay, no confusion here, you're asking her to help you kill somebody. Got it

I'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside

Yeah, he's asking questions about how you feel INSIDE, specifically about being an accomplice to murder
Now would you leave me if your father found out I was thugging?

Would that be before or AFTER you convinced his daughter to be an accomplice to murder?

Are you mad cause I'm asking you 21 questions?

Uh… does that count as one of the questions? Because now it sounds like you're trolling her. You mad I'm asking' you 21 questions? Yo mad, bruh?

Do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams?

Now THIS is a deep question, and the wording is important. Do you TRUST me enough to reveal your inner aspirations, the silly pipe dreams that fuel your motivations, or maybe he's talking about the actual dreams that she has every night, the ones that reoccur and haunt her, the ones that subconsciously unpack everything about her fears, joys, and---

I'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans

…and… and that was a bad transition. I don't even think that was a question, you just said, ""Baby, tell me about the intricate inner workings of THAT apple bottom ASS… also, ya dreams, and shit...

If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see

Okay, this couplet always throws me off, no matter how much credit I try to give this song. Listen to the whole thing

If I was with some other chick and someone happened to see
And when you asked me about it I said it wasn't me
Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?

Yeah, this always got to me. He says, ""If someone saw me with another girl, NOT if someone just told her he was with another girl, and it was ambiguous as to whether or not it actually happened, no, IF IT WAS TRUE that he was with another women and someone told you about it, will you believe him when he says it wasn't him."" To be clear, part of this song's in-depth compatibility quiz about your integrity as a human being in a relationship fundamentally involves you just kind of accepting the fact that he's eventually going to lie to you.. And what's oddly worse is that, after admitting to being the one who would lie and cheat on her in this example, he shifts the problems of the relationship back on HER

Would you believe me or up and leave me?
How deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone?

Yes, 50 Cent's girlfriend: after lying and cheating on you, it's clearly YOU who needs to evaluate how seriously you're taking the relationship!

Yeah, these are the lyrics that almost ruin everything this song had going for it. Not the gangsterism's, not the singing intro by 50 cent, not even the line about cake and fat kids

I love you like a fat kid loves cake
You know my style, I'll say anything to make you smile

Yeah, it's corny, but by itself, it's kinda endearing, because in relationships, you're gonna have stupid little things you say to each other, and in the context of a song, if you don't overdo it, it can be fitting, but what ruins this for me is that this lyric comes immediately after the aforementioned lyrics, and sure these questions are mostly hypotheticals, and these scenarios may not have actually happened yet, but in this specific hypothetical situation, he has shown a blatant willingness to shift the blame on her despite him being the one that screwed up, succeeding these lyrics with limp backpedalling

We're only humans, girl, we make mistakes
To make it up, I'll do whatever it takes
I love you lil a fat kid loves cake

And THAT'S what makes this line bad to me: in this instance, after accidentally showcasing a possible warning sign of things to come in their relationship, he acts like a corny joke will be the thing to make her let it go, and that just doesn't gel well with me

Overall, though, I'd give this song a 3 out of 5. Never underestimate the power of Nate Dogg's vocals, my friends. And in addition, 50 Cent does actually give a realistic and tangible depiction of his aspirations on relationships, and for about 80% of it, it's relatable and understandable. Yes, it has parts that turn me off of it, but I say in the end, this songs gets a pass from me. And to his credit, at least he didn't pull a Ja Rule, *play ""Always On Time""* and make a quote unquote ""love song"" that, in a sickening revelation, was ultimately just about a pimp-ho relationship. No, 50 Cent was pretty upfront when he made THAT song

*""Cause I' m a mothefuckin' P.I.M.P.!""*

Well, I'm the Rap Critic: You don't have to like my opinion, but I don't have to like your song"," when asked by dr dre: ""how you goin' to be gangsta this and that and then put this sappy love song on"" 50 cent responded with: i’m two people i’ve always had to be two people since i was a kid to get by to me that’s not diversity it’s necessity and you know what i can get behind that that's the

hour you gotta love it personally i think riding in the back of a police vehicle kind of sucks but whatever i just want to chill and twist the lye catch stunts in my 745 i just wanna let you know before this love song starts that i'm still totally a gangsta by smoking weed and showing off my expensive cars girl it's easy to love me now and of course 10 points for including the closest thing the new millennium will ever get to isaac hayes mr nate dogg on the hook would you love me if i was down and out would you still have love for me and i gotta give this song a few more points for actually being about something other than the general theme of ""i'm a thug and you're my main bitch"" instead of just that it centers around a sense of doubt about his girlfriend's faithfulness that understandably stems from being really famous and having people around you that only care about you because of your money he wants someone who's interested in more than money… despite what the intro may lead you to believe if i fell off tomorrow would you still love me and he starts off by asking directly: if all of his fame was over tomorrow would you still care about him it's straight up and to the point and i wish he would have started with this instead of the ""riding in my car smoking weed"" nonsense if i got locked up and sentenced to a quarter century could i count on you to be there to support me mentally you know for most ""thugs need love too"" songs they only dwell on a surface level depiction of a relationship but to ask someone if they'd be willing to be emotional support if they were in jail for 25 years that requires some reflection and the delivery makes me feel like it really means something when he says it if i was hit and i was hurt would you be by my side also factoring in the realization that this man has actually been shot at 9 times this is an alarmingly real possibility he's giving this girl to think about if it was time to put in work would you be down to ride okay that's kinda vague you might want to elaborate what you mean because you know one might confuse i get out and peel a nigga cap chill and drive okay no confusion here you're asking her to help you kill somebody got it i'm asking questions to find out how you feel inside yeah he's asking questions about how you feel inside specifically about being an accomplice to murder now would you leave me if your father found out i was thugging would that be before or after you convinced his daughter to be an accomplice to murder are you mad cause i'm asking you 21 questions uh… does that count as one of the questions because now it sounds like you're trolling her you mad i'm asking' you 21 questions yo mad bruh do you trust me enough to tell me your dreams now this is a deep question and the wording is important do you trust me enough to reveal your inner aspirations the silly pipe dreams that fuel your motivations or maybe he's talking about the actual dreams that she has every night the ones that reoccur and haunt her the ones that subconsciously unpack everything about her fears joys and--- i'm staring at ya trying to figure how you got in them jeans …and… and that was a bad transition i don't even think that was a question you just said ""baby tell me about the intricate inner workings of that apple bottom ass… also ya dreams and shit if i was with some other chick and someone happened to see okay this couplet always throws me off no matter how much credit i try to give this song listen to the whole thing if i was with some other chick and someone happened to see and when you asked me about it i said it wasn't me would you believe me or up and leave me how deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone yeah this always got to me he says ""if someone saw me with another girl not if someone just told her he was with another girl and it was ambiguous as to whether or not it actually happened no if it was true that he was with another women and someone told you about it will you believe him when he says it wasn't him"" to be clear part of this song's in-depth compatibility quiz about your integrity as a human being in a relationship fundamentally involves you just kind of accepting the fact that he's eventually going to lie to you and what's oddly worse is that after admitting to being the one who would lie and cheat on her in this example he shifts the problems of the relationship back on her would you believe me or up and leave me how deep is our bond if that's all it takes for you to be gone yes 50 cent's girlfriend: after lying and cheating on you it's clearly you who needs to evaluate how seriously you're taking the relationship yeah these are the lyrics that almost ruin everything this song had going for it not the gangsterism's not the singing intro by 50 cent not even the line about cake and fat kids i love you like a fat kid loves cake you know my style i'll say anything to make you smile yeah it's corny but by itself it's kinda endearing because in relationships you're gonna have stupid little things you say to each other and in the context of a song if you don't overdo it it can be fitting but what ruins this for me is that this lyric comes immediately after the aforementioned lyrics and sure these questions are mostly hypotheticals and these scenarios may not have actually happened yet but in this specific hypothetical situation he has shown a blatant willingness to shift the blame on her despite him being the one that screwed up succeeding these lyrics with limp backpedalling we're only humans girl we make mistakes to make it up i'll do whatever it takes i love you lil a fat kid loves cake and that's what makes this line bad to me: in this instance after accidentally showcasing a possible warning sign of things to come in their relationship he acts like a corny joke will be the thing to make her let it go and that just doesn't gel well with me overall though i'd give this song a 3 out of 5 never underestimate the power of nate dogg's vocals my friends and in addition 50 cent does actually give a realistic and tangible depiction of his aspirations on relationships and for about 80% of it it's relatable and understandable yes it has parts that turn me off of it but i say in the end this songs gets a pass from me and to his credit at least he didn't pull a ja rule *play ""always on time""* and make a quote unquote ""love song"" that in a sickening revelation was ultimately just about a pimp-ho relationship no 50 cent was pretty upfront when he made that song *""cause i' m a mothefuckin' pimp""* well i'm the rap critic: you don't have to like my opinion but i don't have to like your song"

My chest, gotta break away, demons say they'll be punished/
Ask me to explain explain, I won't tell you nothing/

Blood stained fatal plains, feels like my head is just gushing/
Stood up, came to strange, and walked away stumbling/
Just need you to stay away, these feelings are puzzling/

Windows down I’m looking fine
Off to work in the factory
That’s where my nightmares haunting me
I don’t want to ever go back there

They give me that blank stare
As they strip my house bare
Repossessed like exorcism two

Head turns around there’s vomit on the bedsheets
Call in the priest beetle juice giving me grief
Like candy man candy man
Fix my lawn mower if you can
Run over the bee hive light that effigy ma’am
9 children of the corn surround my cabin

Behold the legend, just mastered the session

I am the professor, give you more for lesser
Here's where Preem definitely been a blessing
Suggestions?
And your facing the Wesson
I shove it down your throat like a ?cage of breathmints?
Elegant specimen
Ghetto benjamins
We get from the government but never loving it
Corrupt surcface
There is no purpose
I lay in wake so I correctly wrote this
Praying mamas
Fulling up the churches
?oping that their kids don't hit dirt, kid

Flaming hearts
Was sparking the red Bronx

A legend at it's best, you can check my priors
Premier made the track
Gave me the mudwire
Said the liver
And take no prisoners
What is this?
You're living like Thanksgiving
Always taking but never giving
I'm a different kind of breed
A cure that people need
To kidnap hip hop, I'm ready to fucking bleed
I sold CD's
And system to make ends meet
No bowing on my knees, the agony of defeat
It wasn't part of my repertoire
I'm here to be a star
I keeps it raw
Like a plate of caviar
You want to kick it? You can't hang with us
You don't want hip hop, you just want the bucks

Caught in the ill zone all day like clown, fingerfucking their iPhone
They got no vision, they see the televison
Hardcore rapping ain't just guns and prison
Most of these niggas just be the witness
Passing up the great like moon in the distance
Let me give an example
Let me say for instance
Snitches get snitches after fame and riches
Just leave me alone
I'm just being consistent
Staying disciplined
Multiplying the digits
Preem never left, he gave room for the bitches
So we won't be subjected to the herbs on the record
The feelings all shown like seeing them naked
Mad and frustrated
They can't correct it
Hip hop in the trench is going to break the curse

Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way!
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way!

'Magine Rock up in them projects where them niggas pick your pockets
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings; liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda YOLA whippin', ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just dome'd a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, every day I'm hustlin'
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter n'em—get the fuck up out my way, bish!
Got that drum and I got them bands just like a parade, bish!
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut, them serpents lurkin', Blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my Dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree

[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise]
It go Halle Berry or hallelujah
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever

[Verse 2:EGW]
Dear Mom
I know we've had our fair shair of fights
But I don't go to sleep without thinkin of you atleast once a night
Because of all the things we used to do together
And all the homes we had to lose together
The way you were treated, it ain't an excuse
I didn't grow up like others, But you'll have to excuse
My poor behavior I'm lost
I didn't think there would be a cost
Or a toll, and the fact you couldn't control
The outcome of your relationships
All those men, they were fuckin shits
Pretty smelly, if you ask me
They didn't deserve you, they were unworthy
I see you got a man who will treat you right
Thats good, but he fucks up and he'll meet my right
Cause you're beautiful, and deserve someone who will treat you like a queen
The way I've been acting, I know I've been obscene
Thats why i had to go, this direction is where the wind blowed
And I know, That you were dying inside while you signed those papers
And the expression when i said ""Bye Ma, See you later""
That said it all, But I still love you
And It hurts when i don't hear a I love you too
But, I know you're in pain
Because your son mentally insane
But forgive me ma this once
Because this silence is too fuckin much

Cause your my # 1 and I was yours too
Even though i acted wrong, just give me a clue
As too how long ago I was just like you
Doing stupid things cause it was cool
And you werent tryin to impress as many people as i was
But you still did it, regardless
Just take a look inside and realize
That underneath these blue eyes
Is a boy that can't find
A place to stay,too many homes
I traveled worldwide, next day we're gone
I don't blame you, I blame me

241,324073,Ballad of Barbara,Johnny Cash,en,country,"In a southern town where I was born
That's where I got my education
I worked in the fields and I walked in the woods
And I wondered at creation

[Verse 2]
I recall the sun in a sky of blue
And the smell of green things growing
And the seasons changed and I lived each day
Just the way the wind was blowing

[Verse 3]
Then I heard of a cultured city life
Breath taking lofty steeples
And the day I called myself a man
I left my land and my people

[Verse 4]
And I rambled north, and I rambled east
And I tested and I tasted
And a girl or two, took me round and round
But they always left me wasted

[Verse 5]
In a world that's all concrete and steel
With nothing green ever growing
Where the buildings hide the rising sun
And they blocked the free winds from blowing
You might also like[Verse 6]
Where you sleep all day and you wake all night
To a world of drink and laughter
I met that girl that I was sure would be
The one that I was after

[Verse 7]
In a soft blue gown and formal tux
Beneath that lofty steeple
He said, Do you Barbara, take this man
Will you be one of his people

[Verse 8]
And she said, ""I will"" and she said, ""I do""
And the world looked mighty pretty
And we lived in a fancy downtown flat
Because she loved the noisy city

[Verse 9]
But the days grew cold beneath a yellow sky
And I longed for green things growing
And the thoughts of home and the people there
But she'd not agreed to going

[Verse 10]
Then her hazel eyes turned away from me
With a look that wasn't pretty
And she turned into concrete and steel
And she said, I'll take the city
[Verse 11]
Now the cars go by on the interstate
And my pack is on my shoulder
But I'm going home, where I belong
Much wiser now and older","in a southern town where i was born that's where i got my education i worked in the fields and i walked in the woods and i wondered at creation i recall the sun in a sky of blue and the smell of green things growing and the seasons changed and i lived each day just the way the wind was blowing then i heard of a cultured city life breath taking lofty steeples and the day i called myself a man i left my land and my people and i rambled north and i rambled east and i tested and i tasted and a girl or two took me round and round but they always left me wasted in a world that's all concrete and steel with nothing green ever growing where the buildings hide the rising sun and they blocked the free winds from blowing you might also like where you sleep all day and you wake all night to a world of drink and laughter i met that girl that i was sure would be the one that i was after in a soft blue gown and formal tux beneath that lofty steeple he said do you barbara take this man will you be one of his people and she said ""i will"" and she said ""i do"" and the world looked mighty pretty and we lived in a fancy downtown flat because she loved the noisy city but the days grew cold beneath a yellow sky and i longed for green things growing and the thoughts of home and the people there but she'd not agreed to going then her hazel eyes turned away from me with a look that wasn't pretty and she turned into concrete and steel and she said i'll take the city now the cars go by on the interstate and my pack is on my shoulder but i'm going home where i belong much wiser now and older"

Wake up, grab beer, grab rear, shave beard
Put on some scene gear
Gotta get drunk 'fore my mom wakes up
Break-up with my girlfriend so I can bang sluts
I'm Undead, unfed
Been sleeping on bunk beds since ten
So if I don't booze it, I'm gonna lose it
Everybody get to it, do it, get ruined

Let's keep them 40's popping (What?)
So just get buzzed and stay fucked up
We'll keep them panties dropping

Calm down, it's just a hickey, I'll blame it on this whiskey sipping
Gets me tipsy, drink fast and enjoy your buzz
Take back streets to avoid the fuzz
I wanna take you home but your friends won't let you

Buy beer or pay the rent?

Drunken pussy's what I'm thinking
I don't give a fuck if you're drunk or not
Turn it up loud and feel the ambiance
Grab two hoes and do some body shots
I wanna party all night till they call the cops
Fuck a wristband, let's all do keg stand

When the cops show up, they're gonna get the finger

He could build anything with his two calloused hands

He drove an old truck, he could've had a newer one
Floorboards full of rust but he sure loved the way it'd run
I learned to drive in it in the pastures on our land
With my ol' man

One day he caught me in a lie
And with his belt, he tanned my behind
And I saw the teardrops in his eyes
Falling down just as hard as mine

When you're born a farmer, it's what you want your son to be
He was brokenhearted when I said I'm going to Tennessee
But he sold that old truck and stuck the money in my hand

When I got on that big Greyhound
With my bags full of songs and my guitar
I remember looking down and him yelling
""Son, remember who you are""

Like I needed the steam's leaving my hand
Theme's keeping us close to summer sand
Lost in these rituals thoughts turn to visuals
Flattered by the gabbin' happening it tends to happen as the
Doors open leave it on the speaker even louder thats the needed feature
Chosen to go in the ocean test the water
Frozen for a moment though I hope you didn't notice
Yeah i got her, yeah i got her
Saltwater taste and that body by the waist
Bring that I'll zip my lips and listen whatcha wanna say?

Driving 95 to nowhere, it'd be good to go there
No speedometer Im in the mood to move at my own pace
Leave behind thoughts in the rearview
Mind stays swinging towards taste from a grapevine
Hey it's time, jumping over the fences built
Erase the borders you've been building up the walls you hit
Time is gonna keep pushing so I'ma keep it moving
Now know down the street or at the beach could change the way you see it all
There's a lot of things I try to see so I keep my eyes open to evolve
Uniquely seek a view with peripherals involved
Liftin' looking to shift it
Setting my boat adrift, close or distant, keep it different

3555,441572,Why Write a Letter That You'll Never Send, & The Drones,en,rock,"We don't write letters anymore
There ain't the time or place
But a friend of mine wrote something
Like a letter yesterday
It was smuggled through my inbox
Just this morning, 3:00am
More impotent than important
Let me read it now, verbatim

He says, ""I got that same old feeling
The one that turns the birds to brutes
The sky is like a bad dream
And the earth is in cahoots
I don't believe no one no more
I don't care what no one says
I just want to make the world
A much less painful place
And we look fonder on the good old days
As they drift further away
But why, if everyone feels so homesick
Are they always settin' sail?
'Cause it's all bad news up there on deck
And each headland masks the next
I'd just as soon dive in the ocean
And forgo the blood and sweat
And forgo all aspirations
They just put everyone at odds
If idle hands are the Devil's work
Then where's the time for God's?""
You might also likeOh, yeah...

[Chorus]
Why write a letter that you'll never send
Away? (Why won't you)
Stay with me, wait and see
And all you need know
Nobody's perfect and their needs are always stark
(Stay with me) Wait, you'll see
And all you need know
Everybody's hurting and their needs are always stark
(Stay with me) Stay with me

[Verse 2]
""And who cares about wars of choice and lands
Where states indulge their passions?
And all the new shoots just jackboot scoot
All dissent out of fashion
Like Fred Astaire's at a film premiere
That is all about them
It's stirring stuff, transformative
They don't care where they're sent
And they're all kiss-chasing childish dreams
Of a privileged masculinity
'Til they're spent by shock and discharged home
To small town and big cities
And the rest of the type left are dying or dead
From just trying to be useful
They've been handy in the years gone by
And they'll be handy in the future
And who cares for their survival?
And who cares about the Yanks?
Who cares if they get overrun
By Chinese nukes and tanks?
And who cares about the Holocaust?
Man, we didn't learn nothing there
And all its memory does
Is keep the History Channel on air
And who cares about the Vatican?
Man, everybody knows
And who's surprised they went and chose
A Nazi for a Pope?
And who cares about fakes like anarchists?
Man, they never want to dance
Let's level Mogadishu
Give anarchy a chance
I'm saying life is cruel, you know it's true
But all sides still try to recruit ya
For Shangri-La's as practical
As doing a Kama Sutra""
[Chorus]
And why write a letter that you'll never send
Away? (Why won't you)
Stay with me, wait and see
And all you need know
Nobody's perfect and their needs are always stark
(Stay with me) Wait, you'll see
And all you need know
Everybody's stressed the fact their needs are always stark
(Stay with me) Stay with me

[Verse 3]
""And who cares if the starving millions know
If it's Christmas or your birthday?
Or what movie star's in Africa or
The guy from U2 says?
Or all the statesmen never telling lies
As truth or gospel?
Who cares what's true or false?
The truth's the world won't go to hospital
But who needs to live forever?
And who needs the extra miles?
We won't need bees or seed banks
In the Arctic for a while
We play the game to start again
Not to better life for all
It's the appropriate opiate
When the better way's impossible
Some honesty now wouldn't go astray
And if not, well, what's the use?
We're animals, we can't help doing
What all animals do
So goodbye, my friend, I'm hitting send
Forgive me talking straight
I'm only trying to make the world
A much less painful place""

1946,842668,Saturday Night Fish Fry, & Louis Jordan,en,r-b,"Now if you've ever been down to New Orleans
Then you can understand just what I mean
Now all through the week it's quiet as a mouse
But on Saturday night they go from house to house

[Verse 2]
You don't have to pay the usual admission
If you're a cook, or a waiter or a good musician
So if you happen to be just passin' by
Stop in at the Saturday night fish fry

[Chorus]
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn

[Verse 3]
Now my buddy and me was on the main stem
Foolin' around just me and him
We decided we could use a little something to eat
So we went to a house on Rampart Street
You might also like[Verse 4]
We knocked on the door and it opened with ease
And a lush little miss said, ""Come in, please""
And before we could even bat an eye
We were right in the middle of a big fish fry

[Chorus]
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn

[Verse 5]
Now the folks was havin' the time of their life
And Sam was jivin' Jimmy's wife
And over in the corner was a beat up grand
Being played by a big fat piano man

[Verse 6]
Now, some of the chicks wore expensive frocks
Some of them had on bobbie socks
But everybody was nice and high
At this particular Saturday night fish fry
[Chorus]
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn

[Verse 7]
Now my buddy and me we fell right in
And we hollered, ""Let the joy begin!""
Now, we figured this was a good place to play
Cause the party was already underway

[Verse 8]
But all of the sudden the lights went low
And everybody made straight for the front door
Man, I was so scared I didn't know where to go
I stood right there then I fell on the floor

[Chorus]
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
[Verse 9]
Now the women was screamin' and jumpin' and yellin'
The bottles was flyin', and the fish was smellin'
And way above all the noise we made
Somebody hollered, ""Better get outta here, this is a raid!""

[Verse 10]
I didn't know we were breaking the law but
Somebody reached over and hit me on the jaw
Now they had us blocked off from front to back
And they were puttin' 'em in the wagon like potato sacks

[Chorus]
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn

[Verse 11]
I knew I could get away if I had a chance
But I was shakin' like I had the St. Vitus dance
Now I tried to crawl in under a bath tab
When a policeman said, ""Where are you goin' there, bub?""

[Verse 12]
Now they got us out of there like a house on fire
And put us all in the black Mariah
Now they might have missed a pitiful few
But they got both me and my buddy too

[Chorus]
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn

[Verse 13]
We headed for jail in a dazed condition
They booked each one of us on suspicion
Now my chick came down and with my bail
And finally got me outta that rotten jail

[Verse 14]
Now if you ever want to get a fist in your eye
Just mention a Saturday Night Fish Fry
I don't care how many fish in the sea
But don't ever mention a fish to me

[Chorus]
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn
It was rockin', it was rockin'
You never seen such scufflin'
And shufflin' 'til the break of dawn

To gain back, is so rough, tough couldn't bare the pain
Instant intense migraine
Young souls want quick love
Slow touches and night flings
Don't be,that guy,who analyzes everything
Question tangents, lowered for another time

Just know,when the point comes
The right one, shows up
Everything that happens, there's always reason

An ancient culture has predicted the date without any form of denial or doubt""

Before the arrival of unmanifested worlds
Nothing exists but night and silence
In the unending vast yawning void
Gods are withdrawn in their supernal spheres
Space and time are mere abstractions
Matter is nonexistent in the absence of any organized
Vitality

Time was not lying asleep in
Infinite Duration
The mighty winter and long cold night
Of nonbeing
Realm of the fire melts the distant masses
Forming vapor in the void
The rivers of lives will embody
Untouched worlds

No elements, no forms, no times
Yet to condense from primordial nebula
The dust of dead antecedent stars
The gaping abyss is alone
Overtones vibrate throughout sleeping shelves of space
Protosubstance becoming Orgalmer
From the giants flesh planets were born
Raging seas of his blood
From his bones mountains rise

Marks the feeding of the tree of life

Of power to control

Judgment of its inner God
Domains now form
Existence reveals
Energy which travels through
Waters of space
And its place in the many layered regions of the dead

Even ketamine or methamphetamine with the minithin
It better be at least seventy or three-hundred milligram
And I might as well 'cause I'ma end up bein' a villain again
Levels to this shit, I got an elevator
You could never say to me I'm not a fuckin' record breaker (Yeah)
I sound like a broken record every time I break a record
Nobody could ever take away the legacy I made, I never cater
Motherfucker, now I got a right to be this way

Don't pretend to be amazed
It must be a feast of disgusting
Keeping percussion deep in
The oven in which I speak to beats in
Reaping what I sow
Seeing what is the soul
To freeing my upper knuckles when heating up in the cold
Need I remind me I be holding you hand
Ran over a van stand to stand shoulder to shoulder with Stan
A fan who didn't plan to meet the man
But is instead a fan of reason and people living in basements
C'MON

Can we spend the day in tent just playing hey don't pay the rent
Jaded to the way you complain and say we should end
Fate again hate even can break even in the AM so babe
May we be safe in our rock habits
I got magic back flip the stop gravity in decisions
I'm not mad at me I'm simply listening, different
And hot rapping easily comes with kissing the watch
Is it that or me fascinate even half of what she
Radically calls her lack of need
I sit back and plead what actually did pass
The mental grief, an instrumental, heat, and spazzin'- Dot
Every sentence I don't say is home plate
No play, No lastin' in the sheets
Master what we read and practice what I preach
And I'm only adding butt cause that makes up my checks

And damn if a visit to a different planet wouldn't be pretty
Hamilton answered and pushed the limits of change
Until the limit isn't as strange as intuition is
En-tertainment
Can perhaps be where the backseat can take us
So, Hey love with ya make up blush
Or race cut to make up a way to say RUSH!
Day to day we fuss and take away the 'wasn't us'
Until they say to us make up a way to say that we suck
Pay up, faded painters are like playing with a knife
Day to day night the later craters safe in the day light
Waves to the right and my lady by my side makes me the guy

There was a feeling the spirit was leaving
Red like a marker
So my tribe, with my knife
Cut the heart from a lonely life

[Verse 2]
I saw patterns on floorboards
Deep in the dust was a leader

Turning from oak into cedar
He can assess the situation

Into the forest with the young ones

Onto a new plan
Is the cost to stay lost
Forever in an empty skin, pale and thin?

If it's good, or if it's fortune, I can't tell

Their guns couldn't see us, there's a sea outside my door

They don't rule my world, do they rule yours?
Well I feel sorry for you done, but for real

You said you had the Mac, why you should of sprayed!
What happened to the chicks and the chips you bragged about?
What happened to the guns and the clips you bragged about?
I heard about they stomped you, and beat you, and dragged you out
You said they heard they got me, and that I doubt!
Street smarts and most y'all punks you need heart

When he drove me down that old dusty road
He took me as far as I'd ever been
He wanted me and I wanted him
But I'd always been told I shouldn't give in

[Chorus]
I wouldn't go that far
I didn't follow my heart
He said he loved me
But I wasn't ready
And I wouldn't go that far

[Verse 2]
He was so patient, he didn't give up
With a ring in his hand and a heart full of love
He asked me forever, I asked him to wait
To please understand these dreams I must chase
Though it was a promise I wanted to make

Grime daily
Look

[Verse]
Tweet tweet, they say that I'm the newest in talent
Bugzy Malone is the next to blow
They don't know that I've got a chemical imbalance
Suttin' like Jekyll & Hyde
Spent my teenage years battering guys
Are you forgetting that Bugz is violent?
Make man skatter and hide
Tweet Tweet, Sophie off Coronation Street
Said she can't keep my song out of her head
Imagine me like a minor celeb
This time last year, finding my head
Now I just can't keep girls out of my bed
I used to run them down
Now I gotta keep my phone on silent instead
Tweet, fuck that I don't like updating Twitter
But still nobodies moving quicker
I've been writing bars for a year
And they're already saying I'm the leading spitter
I leave MC's feeling bitter
And if you thought Swaggerman was a big CD the new ones even bigger
Look, I'm off my head
To the grime scene I'm like Shawn of The Dead
My niggas looking on IPP
If he get's locked up informer fi dead
I don't care if your talking to feds
Turn into the devil
This time pull out a tool I keep under my bed
Guaranteed man'll start losing their head
I'm moving fast, hunger
Make bare doe, thunder
Yoo, I'm soz bro this phone is sending me under
Yo, I can't really speak I'm, who's this?
What do ya mean? Private number!
You find that funny, maybe
But money is time, pay me
I get things done A.S.A.P
And that's why I'm on grime, daily
I got fans now, that rate me
But other MC's hate me
Cause they see this ting as a race
If it was then I'd be running at Usain speed
I've been shattering records, lately
Have a look at the connect 4 countdown
Then try telling me that I'm lazy
I'm the joker but I'm no clown
The new CD is out now
I done it in three weeks, I swear down
I'm the popular kid in my town
But I'm not someone to be played with
I've been rapping and spitting for ages
But its never gonna be your time
Cause nowadays Bugz is a hit with ladies
The wickedest ting since garage and grime
Sicker than Mike Tyson in his prime
Your like Mike when he got sat on was crying
And if I said I could fight with Tyson
Then I'd be definitely lying
Cause he don't care about tiger and uppercut
He will come and put me on my backside
I'll be laid out on a relaxed vibe
But I'll definitely come back that night
Holding a tool that you can't bite
Turn into the devil
This time pull out the tool that I keep in my boot
Make everybody in the room see a bright white light
Light up the road, cats eyes
Make a ship sink, capsized
You're one of those guys that might fight
By the time you've made up your mind
Get over here, woom ping
Lights out, night night
I'm just not one of them guys
I'm not an MC this is real life
Let me drop back in
Bugzy Malone I gets it cracking
I started this ting totally hard
For the last four bars I've been totally slacking
They wanna know, now they wanna know, never gonna happen
I spit fire, call me a dragon
And these days I'm switching alot
Cause I know nuff man jump on a bandwagon
And i'm constantly turfing them off
Sonic Boom
Good job I'm like Ricky The Hitman Hatton
They wanna know, now they wanna know, never gonna work
Cause this bad boys never been a jerk

The things that passed the ways we close to last among the other
I see them all-yes I see them all behind

We left them there- there in futile wars
When this was the written riddle

The first weapon that I held was a bone from a dead beast
So many more have come and gone, so easy to left'em all behind
There were times when I was crimson bathed with their blood
But if it wasn't for the week I wouldn't be here now

We left them there in wars of Arrogans
When we wrote the riddle
""Who is the Perfect Enemy?""

As I first traveled the land, then I waded the water
Then I ripped the sky with the stars as my guide
But I flew high I touched the sky
I touched the stars and left my marks behind

And I kill them all

Can we just get down to business?

Let me fill your needs, girl
Open up to me, open up to me

Same one that on which I write these songs for you
They're one in the same
That goes for us, too, I give you my name
The bed on which I lay to sleep
And lay with you and lay in deep
There ain't no difference, this case there isn't
That goes for us, too, I know you're listenin’
Sometimes it feels like I don’t really care
One day you'll see, but in the meantime
Just trust that I’m there
Just trust that I love you
Just trust that I care
Trust that I need you to always be there
Trust that you know me well enough to know

108,7076626,BONES, & Demi Lovato,en,country,"I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
You might also like[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it","i walked through the door with you the air was cold but somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow and i left my scarf there at your sister's house and you've still got it in your drawer even now oh your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze we're singin' in the car getting lost upstate autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place and i can picture it after all these days and i know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more and i might be okay but i'm not fine at all oh oh oh 'causе there we arе again on that little town street you almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me wind in my hair i was there i remember it all too well photo album on the counter your cheeks were turnin' red you used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed and your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team you taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me and you were tossing me the car keys ""fuck the patriarchy"" keychain on the ground we were always skippin' town and i was thinkin' on the drive down ""any time now he's gonna say it's love"" you never called it what it was 'til we were dead and gone and buried check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same after three months in the grave and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame you might also like and i know it's long gone and there was nothing else i could do and i forget about you long enough to forget why i needed to 'cause there we are again in the middle of the night we're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light down the stairs i was there i remember it all too well and there we are again when nobody had to know you kept me like a secret but i kept you like an oath sacred prayer and we'd swear to remember it all too well yeah well maybe we got lost in translation maybe i asked for too much but maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up runnin' scared i was there i remember it all too well and you call me up again just to break me like a promise so casually cruel in the name of bein' honest i'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here 'cause i remember it all all all they say all's well that ends well but i'm in a new hell every time you double-cross my mind you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would've been fine and that made me want to die the idea you had of me who was she a never-needy ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you not weepin' in a party bathroom some actress askin' me what happened you that's what happened you you who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show but then he watched me watch the front door all night willin' you to come and he said ""it's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"" time won't fly it's like i'm paralyzed by it i'd like to be my old self again but i'm still tryin' to find it after plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own now you mail back my things and i walk home alone but you keep my old scarf from that very first week 'cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me you can't get rid of it 'cause you remember it all too well yeah 'cause there we are again when i loved you so back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known it was rare i was there i remember it all too well wind in my hair you were there you remember it all down the stairs you were there you remember it all it was rare i was there i remember it all too well and i was never good at tellin' jokes but the punch line goes ""i'll get older but your lovers stay my age"" from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones i'm a soldier who's returning half her weight and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue just between us did the love affair maim you too 'cause in this city's barren cold i still remember the first fall of snow and how it glistened as it fell i remember it all too well just between us did the love affair maim you all too well just between us do you remember it all too well just between us i remember it just between us all too well wind in my hair i was there i was there i was there down the stairs i was there i was there sacred prayer i was there i was there it was rare you remember it all too well wind in my hair i was there i was there oh down the stairs i was there i was there i was there sacred prayer i was there i was there it was rare you remember it all too well wind in my hair i was there i was there down the stairs i was there i was there sacred prayer i was there i was there it was rare you remember it wind in my hair i was there i was there down the stairs i was there i was there sacred prayer i was there i was there it was rare you remember it"

The harder road to choose

But she came through like a champ
And she blessed the world that day
Then gave the hope of a better life
When she gave him away
Now the innocence and joy
Is there each day he wakes
Expressions of his love of life
In every breath he takes

3258,86028,Flower Child,Nitty Scott (Ft. Kendrick Lamar),en,rap,"Pardon my Bohemian ways
I know I act like I be stuck in a Bohemian daze
You said you love me, so don't rush me
Love is patient and now you gotta trust me
To take form, like the canvas of the Grand Canyon
Product of a beautiful storm or an unborn
Carried just below the heart
Quietly preparing for his start
Let me Michelangelo my Sistine Chapel
You know they say Rome wasn't built in a day
And diamonds need a while before they hit the display
So I guess I see myself in a similar way
I'm paced, like my momma in the kitchen whipping
Always mixing up and fixing
Begged her for a taste and she said it wasn't ready
She stir it up slow and she cook it up steady
This is not a race track, living in the ASAP
I'm just trying to do it justice when it play back
Sometimes I gotta stall the BPM
So I can weave these dreams and polish up these gems
In the end, I got love for the show biz
But sometimes you gotta stop and smell the roses
Keeping up with the Kardashians and Joneses
Nah, I take my time and compose this

[Verse 2: Nitty Scott]
Okay, buffering, creativity suffering
When you bustlin' hustlin' for the numbers and
You missed the journey if you climbed too fast
The beauty of the struggle when it comes to pass
Amateurs swear they need a balancer
I want that legendary like excalibur
Chasing calibers liberated as a bachelor
Traveler, never falling victim to these calendars
Rough draft after rough draft
No staff, perfecting on my abstract craft
And now they calling me celebrity
Only thing I give a damn about is my integrity
They play the game like checkers when I'm talking bout chess
Tryna do more when I'm talking bout less, I stress
Quantity ain't always quality
So let me formulate my prophecy

[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]
When the lights get low and you notice I am the sun
The winter time was snow but only little you know
I will still breathe, give me the keys
I'm resuscitating the game, see me in CPR
My name is a gun cocked, gun shot
Dead and I won't stop
Gun cocked, gun shot
Head in a pine box
With a dozen roses, hold this with a gift card
Gun cocked, gun shot
Flowers on your momma's yard

To put you in a mansion, your new home where you can stay
And never have to worry about bills u gotta pay
And everything that's stressin you jus go nd seems to fade away

And whenever you feel like it, buy plane tickets and fly away
And it gotta be that 1st class

""to be a great""
""MC""

If you ask me, it's much more than Mastering Ceremonies
Because a lot of Masquerading Cornballs
Don't realize it also means Mad Creativity
In this day and age of mediocrity
There's two types of rappers that you'll recognize and hear
But I prefer the ones with the lyrics of the year
Than the gimmick with the gear and the right puppeteer
Now you can be the next Rakim Shakespeare
You're still 10 steps away from having a career
You step up the plate to earn respect from your peers
And end up on deck for the remainder of your years
I suppose this means greatness takes blood, sweat, and tears
It also takes an industry that doesn't breed fear
Or pumping all this mindless crap up in your ears
And limiting in the contrast of what you get to hear
You got to recognize it's a determined idea
A righteous young mind is a devil's worst fear
But when you wanna give the people peace and satisfaction
Everybody's mama wants a piece of the action
So now I fall victim to supply and demand
Immaculate conceptions, born illegitimate
Destined to be the greatest story ever missed
Which means its meant to be for whoever's hearing this
You might also like[Hook 2x]
When it's all said and done it should be heard and seen
'Til this cold-hearted game forces us to change teams
While the lust for the loot spreads out like gangrene
So the haves chase their tails while the nots chase their dreams
As the years chase the days, past the futures, meet fate
Like your firstborn, waiting for pop's release date
Postpone, meanwhile, I accumulate means
To revise and renew what was just heard and seen

It's been stated that I rhyme like God and I build like a poet
One hand wash the other like Lady Macbeth
Flip styles like Bela Karolyi
Warm hearted, cold blooded
I write like opposite left
I left opposites right where they left off
My rights left right-wingers left to right beside me
Left my right hand man cause he left what's right
And I reserve the right to write 'til I'm free
Cause I free styles with my pen
That ya'll couldn't if you freestyled all day long
Literally, this literature designed for one orator
Stays on the head
Emcee's emcee, that I be the emcee's emcee
Cause I am saying what I am thinking
Except when my mind's blinking
My eyes open even when my eyes' drinking
I's a socializer, but more so with those wiser
Ask yourself why's a music so misused it's self contained
And not self sustained
I myself contemplate this 'til I make myself complain
Shall my raps stay maintained, wrapped in cellophane
'Til they're unwrapped by human consumers?
Emphatically no, so I rap wherever I go
And let it grow up in your brain like a tumor
[Hook 2x]

Aiiyo, ya think ya really know me well
There's more to me than ya mind got room for
And much much more than a clever verse or two
That's all you know about me, you ain't even knowing that
You think I give a fuck whether or not my record sells? (hell yeah)
You're damn right but you see that ain't the way I'm keeping score
If one million people said it does that make it true
You judge my music by whether or not my pocket's fat?
Well, fuck you
And the cash cow you're milking (moo)
It ain't yours but the job pays well, don't it?
And if you're lucky you can even get to taste a drop
We'll see who's happy when you're old but you're not grown
You see me, now? Yeah you'll see me later too
Fuckin you up when the vantage point change, don't it?
I know what's hip, but you determine if it's hop or pop
You're just a man without a voice, pass the microphone
I know the diff between written rhymes and freestyles
You see, for me, it's like having sex or making love
And you should know by now I'm married to the pad and pen
But I'm entitled to cheat on her every now and then
Will your children know the hip hop history?
Will the songs you hate be shrouded in mystery?
Don't step to me with your stats and your date smarts
You know your neighborhood by street signs or landmarks?
I'm not talking 'bout the first record ever made
I'm talking 'bout the first one that ever made you
The first records that I played never played me
And I can still play 'em today cause they stay true
You know this time I'm only speaking on the timeless
It makes sense now and then, yeah, now and then
Cause now it's making picture perfect sense and then
It's making picture perfect sense like it did now

Try to walk away I feel it in my soles
Looking for some class but the books stay on hold

I got my ass up when I heard that money calling
I had to switch the line on them niggas that were stalling
Now I'm back to put that whack shit up in a coffin
California marijuana got a nigga coughing
Ashtray full of regrets and no problems,and still they can't solve them
Confidence: they can't take it off him. I'm awesome
Opposition slept and I lost them. It cost them everything
All this shit's ahead of me
Most of you will fold but I just approach readily
Shooting for the stars gotta hold the Glock steady
Not a chance I'mma miss like a lay-up if you 7'3""
Ain't no turning back, my pride will be the death of me
I do so many wrong everybody's second guessing me
See I gotta win, but that shit just doesnt pressure me
I'm all about the challenge, take a chance bitch step to me
Kill them all, Kill them all, thats the only mission
They told me I would fail, I was too broke to pay attention
Proceeded on my way; to have it all was my intention
Now look how far I came for someone who didn't listen
Single parent home but my situation different
I've got to help my mother, cause my brothers autistic
So when I say I need it every word is authentic
Get the fuck up out my way if you ain't got the ambition, bitch
Killing shit, and ain't to much as real as this
I'mma move in silence, while you niggas on that silly shit
Perfect blueprints, you are witnessing me building it
But you never keep your mouth shut; nigga zip it like you thrilla' fit
You can try to mimic but you'll never get as sick as this
Far too disciplined to get caught up in that gimmick shit
Ain't this shit ridiculous? I'm reaping all the benefits
Of Odd Future records fuck your contract imprisonment
Fuck the industry, I'm in the street that I'm living in
Making shit work, tired of waiting finna get it in
I put my hope in all the real niggas feeling this
Belong at the top but just give me a little bit
Got the floor plan to have me sitting on the ceiling bitch
And I'm forever loyal to the people that I get it with
As long as I'm alive I'mma ride getting high
I hope to God when I die my soul rise to the sky
Real talk, and real niggas feel it
G's fly high haters sink like dishes
In a cold world it's survival of the fittest
If you're feeling how I feel then I'mma see you at the finish
When I say it's mine it's just a promise I'mma get it

When she met him they were teenagers
He was no more than seventeen
She was a little less than all that
But he held the bit between her teeth
He was tall and strong and lanky
The fear of Jesus was on her side
He asked her if she weren't too busy
Might come out for a ride

[Chorus]
She'll ride him until he's dead
Or rises to the occasion

They ran off the great embankment
They flew through the air so far
They landed with a mighty crash
Then got crushed by the falling star

[Chorus]

That small crossroads became a city
She was the bell of every ball
Boys would line up to try to ring her
She's let them line up down her hall
She ran up a life so lavish
Somehow those bills would all get paid
Your daddy worked and never faltered
Never forgot the things she said

No more thinkin' bout what you do (Uh)
There's no more of me running back to you (What? What?)

Spectacular, make me lick you from your neck
To your back, then you're shivering, tongue delivering (Uh)
Chills up that spine, that ass is mine (Woo)
Skip the wine and the candlelight, no Cristal tonight
If it's alright with you, we fucking (That's cool)
Déjà vu, the blunts sparked, finger fucking in the park
Pissy off Bacardi Dark
Remember when I used to play between your legs? (Uh)
You begged for me to stop
Because you know where it would head (Uh)
Straight to your mother's bed
At the Marriott, we be lucky if we find a spot
Next to your sister, damn, I really missed the
Way she used to rub my back, when I hit that
Way she used to giggle when your ass would wiggle (Haha)

I decided I'd look up a girl that I once knew
I bought some flowers and went to see a girl I used to know
The lady at her door said she had married long ago
Times will change and towns will change; there I was alone
And suddenly I wondered, ""Would Susie be at home?""
So with the flowers in my hand, I walked toward her gate
Someone touched me on the arm and said, ""You'll have to wait.""
Then I noticed there were people standing in a line
And some of them were holding pretty flowers just like mine
They explained that Susie had been in an awful crash
Doctors said that she had just a little while to last
When I walked into her room, I felt a sense of shame
But I heard Susie whisper, ""I'm awfully glad you came.""
She had been the girl that I had always gone to see
When someone that I cared for had been untrue to me
I handed her the flowers and she gently kissed my hand
She said, ""Don't be embarrassed; you know I understand.""
I said, ""Goodbye"" and as I bent to kiss her fevered brow
I heard her whisper, ""Thank you for the second handed flowers.""You might also like","i was working in miami for a day or two i decided i'd look up a girl that i once knew i bought some flowers and went to see a girl i used to know the lady at her door said she had married long ago times will change and towns will change; there i was alone and suddenly i wondered ""would susie be at home"" so with the flowers in my hand i walked toward her gate someone touched me on the arm and said ""you'll have to wait"" then i noticed there were people standing in a line and some of them were holding pretty flowers just like mine they explained that susie had been in an awful crash doctors said that she had just a little while to last when i walked into her room i felt a sense of shame but i heard susie whisper ""i'm awfully glad you came"" she had been the girl that i had always gone to see when someone that i cared for had been untrue to me i handed her the flowers and she gently kissed my hand she said ""don't be embarrassed; you know i understand"" i said ""goodbye"" and as i bent to kiss her fevered brow i heard her whisper ""thank you for the second handed flowers""you might also like"

Out o'er the Western town
She told a sad, sad story
Of the great ship that went down

[Verse 2]
T'was the fourteenth day of April
Over the waves she rode
Sailing into tomorrow
To a gilded age foretold

[Verse 3]
The night was black with starlight
The seas were sharp and clear
Moving through the shadows
The promised hour was near

[Verse 4]
Lights were holding steady
Gliding over the foam
All the lords and ladies
Heading for their eternal home

The chandeliers were swaying
From the balustrades above
The orchestra was playing
Songs of faded love

He was often so inclined
He closed his eyes and painted
The scenery in his mind

[Verse 8]
Cupid struck his bosom
And broke it with a snap
The closest woman to him
He fell into her lap

[Verse 9]
He heard a loud commotion
Something sounded wrong
His inner spirit was saying
That he couldn't stand here long

[Verse 10]
He staggered to the quarterdeck
No time now to sleep
Water on the quarterdeck
Already three foot deep
[Verse 11]
Smokestack was leaning sideways
Heavy feet began to pound
He walked into the whirlwind
Sky splitting all around

The ship was going under
The universe had opened wide
The roll was called up yonder
The angels turned aside

[Verse 13]
Lights down in the hallway
Flickering dim and dull
Dead bodies already floating
In the double bottom hull

[Verse 14]
The engines then exploded
Propellers they failed to start
The boilers overloaded
The ship's bow split apart

[Verse 15]
Passengers were flying
Backward, forward, far and fast
They mumbled, fumbled, and tumbled
Each one more weary than the last
[Verse 16]
The veil was torn asunder
'Tween the hours of twelve and one
No change, no sudden wonder
Could undo what had been done

[Verse 17]
The watchman lay there dreaming
At forty-five degrees
He dreamed that the Titanic was sinking
Dropping to her knees

Wellington he was sleeping
His bed began to slide
His valiant heart was beating
He pushed the tables aside

[Verse 19]
Glass of shattered crystal
Lay scattered roundabout
He strapped on both his pistols
How long could he hold out?

[Verse 20]
His men and his companions
Were nowhere to be seen
In silence there he waited for
Time and space to intervene

[Verse 21]
The passageway was narrow
There was blackness in the air
He saw every kind of sorrow
Heard voices everywhere

[Verse 22]
Alarm-bells were ringing
To hold back the swelling tide
Friends and lovers clinging
To each other side by side

[Verse 23]
Mothers and their daughters
Descending down the stairs
Jumped into the icy waters
Love and pity sent their prayers

[Verse 24]
The rich man, Mister Astor
Kissed his darling wife
He had no way of knowing
Be the last trip of his life

[Verse 25]
Calvin, Blake, and Wilson
Gambled in the dark
Not one of them would ever live to
Tell the tale or disembark

[Verse 26]
Brother rose up 'gainst brother
In every circumstance
They fought and slaughtered each other
In a deadly dance

[Verse 27]
They lowered down the lifeboats
From the sinking wreck
There were traitors, there were turncoats
Broken backs and broken necks

[Verse 28]
The bishop left his cabin
To help all those in need
Turned his eyes up to the heavens
Said, ""The poor are yours to feed""

[Verse 29]
Davey the brothel-keeper
Came out dismissed his girls
Saw the water getting deeper
Saw the changing of his world

[Verse 30]
Jim Backus smiled
He never learned to swim
Saw the little crippled child
And he gave his seat to him

[Verse 31]
He saw the starlight shining
Streaming from the East
Death was on the rampage
But his heart was now at peace

[Verse 32]
They battened down the hatches
But the hatches wouldn't hold
They drowned upon the staircase
Of brass and polished gold

[Verse 33]
Leo said to Cleo
I think I'm going mad
But he'd lost his mind already
Whatever mind he had

[Verse 34]
He tried to block the doorway
To save all those from harm
Blood from an open wound
Pouring down his arm

[Verse 35]
Petals fell from flowers
Tell all of them were gone
In the long and dreadful hours
The wizard's curse played on

[Verse 36]
The host was pouring brandy
He was going down slow
He stayed right to the end and he
Was the last to go

[Verse 37]
There were many, many others
Nameless here forever more
They never sailed the ocean
Or left their homes before

[Verse 38]
The watchman, he lay dreaming
The damage had been done
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
And he tried to tell someone

[Verse 39]
The captain, barely breathing
Kneeling at the wheel
Above him and beneath him
Fifty thousand tons of steel

[Verse 40]
He looked over at his compass
And he gazed into its face
Needle pointing downward
He knew he lost the race

[Verse 41]
In the dark illumination
He remembered bygone years
He read the Book of Revelation
And he filled his cup with tears

[Verse 42]
When the Reaper's task had ended
Sixteen hundred had gone to rest
The good, the bad, the rich, the poor
The loveliest and the best

[Verse 43]
They waited at the landing
And they tried to understand
But there is no understanding
For the judgment of God's hand

[Verse 44]
The news came over the wires
And struck with deadly force
The love had lost its fires
All things had run their course

[Verse 45]
The watchman he lay dreaming
Of all the things that can be
He dreamed the Titanic was sinking
Into the deep blue sea","the pale moon rose in its glory out o'er the western town she told a sad sad story of the great ship that went down t'was the fourteenth day of april over the waves she rode sailing into tomorrow to a gilded age foretold the night was black with starlight the seas were sharp and clear moving through the shadows the promised hour was near lights were holding steady gliding

couldn't stand here long he staggered to the quarterdeck no time now to sleep water on the quarterdeck already three foot deep smokestack was leaning sideways heavy feet began to pound he walked into the whirlwind sky splitting all around the ship was going under the universe had opened wide the roll was called up yonder the angels turned aside lights down in the hallway flickering dim and dull dead bodies already floating in the double bottom hull the engines then exploded propellers they failed to start the boilers overloaded the ship's bow split apart passengers were flying backward forward far and fast they mumbled fumbled and tumbled each one more weary than the last the veil was torn asunder 'tween the hours of twelve and one no change no sudden wonder could undo what had been

Filled with sadness and confusion

Every day heartaches grow a little stronger (Just a little stronger)
I can't stand this pain much longer

[Verse 1]
Along the Forest Road, there's hundreds of cars – luxury cars
Each has got its load of convertible bars, cutlery cars – superscars!
For today is the day when they sort it out, sort it out
'Cause they disagree on a gangland boundary
'Cause they disagree on a gangland boundary

[Verse 2]
There's Willy Wright and his boys – one helluva noise, that's Billy's boys!
With fully-fashioned bugs, that's Little John's thugs
The Barking Slugs – supersmugs!
For today is the day when they sort it out, sort it out
Yes, these Christian soldiers fight to protect the poor
East end heroes got to score in

[Chorus]
The Battle of Epping Forest
Yes, it's the Battle of Epping Forest
Right outside your door
And you ain't seen nothing like it
No, you ain't seen nothing like it
Not since the Civil War

[Middle Eight]
Coming over the hill are the boys of Bill and Johnny's lads stand very still
With the umpire's shout, they all start to clout – there's no guns in this gentleman's bout
And Georgie moves in on the outside left with a chain flying 'round his head
And Harold Demure, from Art Literature, nips up the nearest tree (Here come the cavalry!)
Amidst the battle roar accountants keep the score: 10-4
They've never been alone, after getting a radiophone
The bluebells are ringing for Sweetmeal Sam, real ham
Handing out bread and jam just like any picnic
Picnic, Picnic, Picnic
You might also like[Verse 3]
It's 5 to 4 on William Wright; he made his pile on Derby night
When Billy was a kid, walking the streets, the other kids hid – so they did!
And now, after working hard in security trade, he's got it made
The shops that need aid are those that haven't paid

[Verse 4]
“I'll do my double-show quick!”
Said Mick the Prick, fresh out the nick
“I sell cheap holiday. The minute they leave and a visit I pay – does it pay!”
And his friend, Liquid Len by name of Wine, Women & Wandsworth fame
Said “I'm breaking the legs of the bastard that got me framed!
I'm breaking the legs of the bastard that got me framed!”
Got me framed

[Bridge]
They called me the Reverend when I entered the Church unstained
My employers have changed, but the name has remained
It all began when I went on a tour hoping to find some furniture
Followed a sign saying “Beautiful Chest”
It led to a lady who showed me her best
She was taken by surprise when I quickly closed my eyes
So she rang the bell and quick as hell
Bob the Nob came out on his job
To see what the trouble was
“Louise, is the Reverend hard to please?”
“You're telling me!”
“Perhaps, sir, if it's not too late
We could interest you in our old-fashioned Staffordshire plate?”
“Oh no, not me, I'm a man of repute.”
But the Devil caught hold of my soul and a voice called out “Shoot!”
To save my steeple, I visited people;
For this I'd gone when I met Little John
His name came, I understood
When the judge said, “You are a robbing hood.”
He told me of his strange foundation
Conceived on sight of the Woodstock nation
He'd had to hide his reputation
When poor, it was salvation from door to door
But now, with a pin-up guru every week
It was Love, Peace & Truth Incorporated for all who seek
He employed me as a karma mechanic, with overall charms
His hands were then fit to receive, receive alms
[Chorus]
That's why we're in the Battle of Epping Forest
Yes, it's the Battle of Epping Forest
Right outside your door
We guard your souls for peanuts
And we guard your shops and houses
For just a little more, just a little more

[Middle Eight]
In with a left hook is the Bethnal Green Butcher, but he's countered on the right by Mick's chain-gang fight
And Liquid Len, with his smashed bottle men, is lobbing Bob the Nob across the gob
With his kisser in a mess, Bob seems under stress, but Jones the Jug hits Len right in the mug
And Harold Demure, who's still not quite sure, fires acorns from out of his sling (Here come the cavalry!)
Up, up above the crowd, inside their Silver Cloud, done proud
The bold and brazen brass, seen darkly through the glass
The butler's got jam on his Rolls; Roy doles out the lot
With tea from a silver pot just like any picnic
Picnic, Picnic, Picnic

[Instrumental Break 09:37-10:05]

[Outro]
Along the Forest Road, it's the end of the day and the Clouds roll away
Each has got its load – they'll come out for the count at the break-in of day
When the limos return for their final review, it's all through, all they can see is the morning goo
“There's no-one left alive – must be a draw.”
So the Blackcap Barons toss a coin to settle the score

Bland boy, no toy to a man like yourself
He was just no one, someone who needed something else
Time left room for me to reconsider
What had been winter and where the grass did grow
Time left room for me to reconsider, who and what I knew
And where that boy did go
First kiss: neither hit nor miss; it blurs from the quickness it keeps
First love: too much at once for that troubled boy to take
Blue lake, for sanity's sake he swam and dove too deep
Grey skies, green eyes - they change with the growing grass
Time left room for me to reconsider
What had been winter and where the grass did grow
Time left room for me to reconsider, who and what I knew
And where that boy did go
Loss of what is so precious
Confused with the scenery
A face with no name, a place without space
It's useless, boy don't you see
Time left room for me to reconsider
What had been winter and where the grass did grow

Fuego in this bitch pull a muhfucking fire alarm
I got a hot hand, and fire arm, with a barrel so big that it look like it fire arms
Cannon mouth closed, you don't wanna see this fire yawn
Tired of these parodies
Game need a pair of me's
Peace Up is the reign tell the driver put the wipers on
And I'm tryna get it rolling like it's X in my hand kinda like I'm tryna put a tire on
You ain't fitted for this, cap, don't even gotta try it on
You just worried bout the wrong things
I'm tryna make an album that my family can retire on
I'm the new connect
Tell these dial up niggas they gone have to wait
Called me for 40 keys, and I told him I got 88
Black and white desegregate
Fuck walking on water
Little panther just learned how to levitate
A phony nigga that's an individual with whom I shall never self-affiliate
Get it straight
As long as the world still tilts on an axis
Ima spit that that'll make a paralyzed man do the cat daddy into a backflip
Acrobatics, Afro black shit
Chiropractics, hope somebody got your back cause all these raps is
Allen Iverson interviews
This is not a game, we talking practice
Samurai tactics when I make cuts
Dancing on the track, Jabba Wockee in a relay
All I need is some head while I'm watching ESPN top 10 replays
These cats so street, I'm eway
Fuck drugs, war on DEA
Crack is wack, but what's wacker is that blacks doing bids like they shopping on eBay
Little consciousness, whatever
Hold your head to my fellas in the ant farms
Life is a test but I pray that I never see the pen like a scantron
I could never be PC
Voices in my head tell me Mac more
I got the flow down like a carpet layer, but your flow always fall through like a Scooby doo trap door
Aw naw. My circle shaping up to be actually what we asked for
What we gotta act for?
I heard you like to hang with a square like a backboard. Mmmm
Picture painting pupil pay the piper for a petty paying occupation, pshh, please, player, i ain't that patient
Picture putting poverty on a pedestal, pedigree every nation on the planet I'm Triple H'ing
I'm from where they gentrified the city making all them bad boys like diddy
I'm from where they segregated, closed schools, just to make the city look pretty
I be like ""Fuck Rahm"" on daily
Progressing against oppression we gone make it
Grandma say I shouldn't curse so much, but that don't mean I'm not educated
Rap game Bonilla-Silva
I'm a silverback gorilla when I rap
Beast mode, you gone need a cheat code and a deep throat to swallow all your pride when you hear Gizzogh snap
Your city ain't cold
Shout out Real Talk man that be boy spiffy
Shout out Frankiem, shout out to Mellow King
Man we 424 like a rookie Ken Griffey

Get ya bodied tanned fully

Takes her chances and makes choices off of dreams and things
Mama do her best to help her, and she makes it very clear..
But all she wanted was her ear
You see, it was a push of maturation
Close to graduation
When she stumbled up and fell a victim to infatuation
It was just a young mistake, it's somethin we be known for
But Mama saw it different, made her feel like she was wrong for it
And I ain't in to justifyin sides
But a parents there to help, despite her underlyin pride
But baby girl ain't get it, so the young inside her died
And now she flamin up the loud to confide

[Hook]
Cause she was just young
Misunderstood
Not dumb, but in the hood
It's no love for all the children
So we..
We hit the homie up, in lieu of our luck..
Escape our pain for the sawbuck..

[Verse 2]
I'm just this ignorant young thing, no longer 16
And the world is evil and they out to get me
Accordin to my mama, yeah thats somethin that she clear about
..but I just need for her to hear me out
See I'm not this asshole who chose sittin on my ass
Over tryna make some moves and gettin to my fuckin classes
Tell her everyday I'm on the grind fasho
She tell me I'm wastin my time and it's time to go..
Back to your lessons, so I can hit the lecture hall
I'm better off popppin ziplocs of adderall
She so impatient, tick tocks corrode her
Won't appreciate this new wrist watch I stole her
Guess not
My father wants his son to make it major
But can't seem to release his inner hatred for his neighbor
I couldn't do school, felt a victim of my age..
And when I called HIS ass a fool, I fell victim to his rage
And I ain't into justifyin sides
But my parents should be helpin, fuck they underlyin pride
They haven't, and awhile ago, the young inside me died
Now I'm flamin up the loud to confide

Another day, another misfortune
I cannot afford to lose my place
Cause when I step outside I can feel it
We could be close to the end and I can’t help it

[Verse 1: Jarren Benton]
You a bitch if you hating on this shit
I grew up off of Southernplayalisticadillacmusik
The everyday bullshit can make a nigga reclusive
I give you all the exclusives, I’m twisting dope like a Rubik’s
(yeah) cube, nigga take a walk in my shoes
Come deal with my paranoia, I’m so scared I might lose
Sip a couple light brews that might lighten my mood
At least for my baby’s sake I pray I make the right moves
I feel like God with a murderous ink pen
About to put a couple hollow points in your ink skin
Rappers you fugazi, we can see that you pretend
Butter soft, leather in the seats that I’m sinking
Welcome to the mind of Mr. Benton
The fuck is these niggas sniffing?
The verbal serial killer just itching to stick this clip in
Niggas nothing different, same shit, different porcelain
Thank God we walked up out that abortion clinic
Old school Chevy, the windows tinted
Another homicide, 12 need more forensics
The fact is, pigs murdering black kids
And black kids murdering black kids
Ay where the value in that?
It’s like we don’t see no value in black
A fatherless habitat, moving vials of that crack

And I'm guilty of it too, I profile niggas like um
What this nigga up to? Damn he lookin' shady
Is he casing my crib while I'm clutchin' on the 3.80?
Meanwhile he's just tryna find the local gymnasium
We assume the worse and we plant these seeds in our cranium
Damn that’s that same mindframe that killed Trayvon
But we don’t think shit bout the bitch when she selling Avon
Wake up, something going on my niggas
We murder over dumb shit, still miss the big picture
Psychological damage planted in our genes
How’d we go to this when we used to be kings and queens

Lonestar belt buckles and old faded Levis
And each night begins a new day
And if you don't understand him, and he don't die young
He'll probably just ride away

Time I motherfuckin' turn around, a bitch comin' to me talkin'

DEB:  Hey, hold up, hold up, check this out ...

Verse 1:  Debonaire
When you first moved in, you ain't talked so slick
All you had to do was clean and take dick
Knowin' that Deb would bring home the bacon
Everything was cool, but now you break him
Sayin' how I don't take you out
Like when we first met, but think about
This motherfucker that bought you cribs
Comin' home to fast food instead of home-cooked ribs
I ain't complained, but you go on
Talkin' 'bout shit like your period's on
Sayin' how I spend too much time
Away from you with those friends of mine
A nigga will be a nigga
And a hoe will think that he's trying to egg her
So, bitch, you better get it straight
Before you become the bitch that I hate

But while I'm out workin', where the fuck are you?
You lay around my house, you ain't doin' shit
Matter fact, you startin' to make me sick
Always bitchin', cryin', yellin', and tryin'
To tell me how I'm doin' you wrong but you're lyin'
So be quiet, stop singin' the blues
'Cause I know plenty hoes who wanna be in your shoes
So if I was you, baby, I'd just chill
'Cause if I don't work, who'll pay the bills?
You sure don't work, so say that crap
All you do is make love and can't do that
You better sit y'butt down and rest your nerves
Before you find your shit somewhere out on the curb
Think about it, and get your shit straight
Before you become the bitch that I hate
BITCH:  Deb, yo' motherfuckin' ass think you slick, but I know you
And that ol' raggly-ass friend of yours, JT, be out there

In the end you got a win-win, only thing I lost is my competitors.""
He said, ""Yeah but Lasers was your worst and nothing like ya first.""
I said, ""Well that's me vs. me and your growth is nothing like your birth.""
He said, ""You're a lame dumbed down sellout only known for talking out your ass.""

I left thinking how I used to be in his shoes
Writing verses flipping burgers
Now I serve the world pearls from socio-political menus
And how I could never back, only because I never left

2722,85433,Behind My Painted Smile,Akala (Ft. Lowkey),en,rap,"Behind my painted smile when all the revolutionary noise is nothing but a lost little boy
Confused and insecure, arrogant and oversure
An egotistical prick so come on please praise me more
It's great that my music bettered you but I contemplate murder every day so don't put me on a pedestal
Plus truly, just the vehicle the music just runs through me
In my better moments I could let the universe use me

[Lowkey]
Behind my smile there's generations of pain, self-hatred, ingrained miseducated my brain
Decimated the place where my dead relations were slain
Not just physically but mentally penetrated our veins
What you got inside hasn't gotta die once it can die a lot of times, that I promise my son
Analyse every song that I've done - tryna fight colonialism with a colonised tongue

[Hook]
Here I stand again
Living in sin
Caught up, in the dream
Behind the painted smile

[Akala Verse:2]
Behind my painted smile is the most painful grimace
This mental prison I live in cause I am so conditioned
By my privilege, what a strange contradiction
To grow up brown in Britain and know that your living
Was paid for by a carcass that resembles yours
Born in the heart of the empire
You're worth more than others just like you
But less then the native ones, raised by my mum but in this world I am a father's son
You might also like[Lowkey]
Behind my painted smile, a very flawed human being
Done many things that I regret and never knew the reason
What do you believe in, truth or freedom or are you deceiving?
I don't wanna die in prostration to European's
They say the answer is within you and nowhere else
Understand the vision man on a mission to know himself
This is for my co-defendants no retreat and no surrender
You probably think that we don't remember Ota Benga

[Hook]

[Akala verse:3]
The smile is painted on my face is tainted by a frown
Picture in the pocket's of blood that decorate the town
Trigger jum bullets sung and guns hum
Then everyone that's dead was somebody's someone

[Lowkey]
Behind my painted smile I feel like a naked child
Maybe rapping ain't for now cos my passion is fading out
Up early though I search and roam along this dirty road
Just another traveller taking a long journey home

[Akala]
All this talk of intervention to protect on what is the intention
Same as it ever was the colonial past and present
And more respect for most of the right wingers
Than the paternalistic patronising liberal bigot
[Lowkey]
Our way of life is so divine, we should intervene
Select war and export the British dream
Behind cinema screens there's much that isn't seen
George Clooney war movies never bring our children peace

[Akala]
Yo fam, you ever wake up and just feel like fucking off,and never coming back to this place and just cutting off?

[Lowkey]
All the time, almost did last year the trouble was the bloody cops had me running in and out the bloody dock

[Akala]
I been there brother, though I don't promote it in this rap shit, I ain't a stranger to having my back on their blue plastic

[Lowkey]
Can't keep us captive

[Akala]
We see the tactics

[Lowkey]
To keep us passive

[Akala]
We beat the fascists
[Lowkey]
Release the classics

[Akala & Lowkey]

Bright lights, fancy restaurants
Everything in this world that a man could want
Got a bank account bigger than the law should allow
Still, I'm lonely now
Pretty faces from the covers of the magazines
From their covers to my covers, wanna lay with me
Fame and fortune still can't find
Just a grown man runnin' out of time

I don't wanna be a lonely fool

The janitor said come with me, got something cool to show ya
I followed him into the back, where costumes lined the walls

He stuffed and he pushed us into wire-framed suits
He ran from the lot while he left us to rot

Bars like some Dove, my reflection who I love
Strutting like I am the shit and stomping, Third Boy's in the cut
All black but I'm living, realistic and livid
Achilles heel on the pivot, a riveting exhibition
They gonna have my ass singing
Hash-slanging, chain hanging, banter is all I'm saying
Mentality tainted they fainted, hated and fate did
Gave them lacking education, so gracious I'm blessed with patience
Persona so arcane, no playing if you're plain
Your whole crew is super lame, I can't wait to switch with fame
So all that is to blame whenever I start to fade
Disassociate from y'all brains in any kind of way

Barons on, home-running first pitch
I could be something so cool and so different
Ambitious but so cold and so distant

A pauper rich with his words

Steady comin' up, wonderin' how, never been as fly, so look at me now

Never thought I'd be this fly, what? Never thought I'd be this tight, what?
Never thought I'd have my time, what? Never thought you'd hear me rhyme, but
Everybody wanna a piece of my cut, that record deal got signed, what?
It's a trip how people change, in this game, but I'm still the same
Never thought I'd be this fly, what? Never thought I'd be this tight, what?
Never thought I'd have my time, what? Never thought you'd hear me rhyme, but
Everybody wanna a piece of my cut, that record deal got signed, what?
It's a trip how people change, in this game, but I'm still the same

[Verse 2]
Started growin' up, started to bloom, seen if everything changed after the storm
E-lay C-lay quarter to noon, write more, fight more, stay in the room
Gettin' with the wrong guy, never again, get it from the wrong guy, never a friend
Try to go the straight road, tryin' to end, low self esteem, feels tryin' to mend
Niggas try to see me, never before, bitches wanna be me, never before
Niggas that would diss me, tryin' to score, bitches now jealous, callin' me whore
Heard game, ran game, many of lines, got played, got laid many of times
Crushed inhibition, lookin' for signs, love didn't live here then it was blind

[Chorus]
Never thought I'd be this fly, what? Never thought I'd be this tight, what?
Never thought I'd have my time, what? Never thought you'd hear me rhyme, but

[Verse 3]
""Who's she?"" Everybody askin' me, ""Who's she?"" Everybody ask to see
Who, me? Everybody tryna be, game ain't never been a thing to me
Was broke, now I tote plenty of G's, got mad gear with L of V
Need be my love and it's sweet, feathers in my hair, real Puerto Ric'
Came up, had lots of luck, came up, heads like destruct
Write more, no gettin' stuck, write more, then make a buck
Bitch can't be hurt, doin' my thing? Been that shit, heard runnin' schemes
Now I'm the hottest thing on the scene, straight line, got mine, know what I mean?
Keep it on top, my parade, hope it don't fly, masquerade
Myself from them days of play, stories like this that I relate
Hopin' that, don't start to slip, hopin' that, can keep a grip
Write rhymes that I can flip, motherfuckin' business, it's a trip
Learned that life ain't a game, passed up, passed by, it's a shame
Nothin' in life stayin' the same, time go by, things have changed
Look up, look by, it remains, still be sittin' and still complain
Gold digger's dreamed of a full tank, look up for the sky, say my name

2778,4101,Locked Up Freestyle,Immortal Technique,en,rap,"I'll murder you in front of your crib like John Lennon
Rip the tendons out of your muscle to cut the tension
I'm beyond your comprehension
Like related subatomic particles and fifth dimensions
Suspension in your breathin' is what I'm leavin'
'Til a legion of demons whisper the meaning of life in your ear
Right before they make your motherfuckin' life disappear
But just 'cause you hear the multi-syllabic grammatical
Don't compare me to rappers that are on sabbatical
'Cause I never did business in Little fuckin' Italy
I play checkers on triple-decker tour buses in Tripoli
The way that you typically bicker with me inexplicably
Is a mystery that pisses me off ridiculously
Because I'm lyrically beyond your level scientifically
Specifically spittin' out the spic in me prolifically
I'm the majority of America futuristically
After I die, fuck my music, you'll feel me spiritually
Darker than Sicily rippin' above the averages
You hold no weight, like bitches after miscarriages
And your label produces no kids, like gay marriages
I'm disparagin' every fake thug rapper in sight
That's why your faggot-ass will never make it into the light
I'll crack your skull when I smash your face into the mic
And now you know what I'm like
I'll Suge Knight the industry
I feel like the spirit of Nat Turner got into me
You're infinitely hopeless
You sound like shit when you spit live, like Jennifer Lopez
I'll massacre a rich rapper and all his broke friends
And go to Club Cheetah, rockin' some blood-soaked Tims
Party-crashin', animal-fuckin' model bitches
Leavin' their stick-figure anorexic pussy in stitches
My verbal blitzes have outshined your offense
You're watered-down nonsense, and I'm two-hundred proof
Chokin' the local youth in this home-made vocal booth
You're a fuckin' incompetent killer like Rae Carruth
And I'm Technique, the rawest nigga ever produced
I spit nastier than regurgitatin' period juice
So burn your fuckin' rhyme book
Stay warm, and put it to good use
I'm about to drop like frozen airplane shit through your roof
And I'm sick of fake hustlers tellin' lies to the youth
You never robbed Dominicans
And you couldn't sling rocks if you was Palestinian
You broke motherfucker, you cats don't burn rubber

I busted out the waiting room
With a glance at the doctor
They caught me at the ocean
Holding hands with a lobster
Other hand full of vodka
Rubber bands in my pants
So I can dance in the aqua
('Gotta dance' is the mantra)
Aqua Man is a monster
Both the cops and the robbers
Are dropping tabs on the pasta
So don't eat the tortellini
It's pork and bean-y
It needs a little pepper
And seventy-four zucchinis
I'm more than peachy
So you can grab a fork and eat me
And my organs weekly
Since I'm becoming bored and sleepy
(I'd rather be in orbit spinning)
Uncork the Henny
Its almost four o' clock
And I'm ready for Mork and Mindy
The show is very orphan friendly
I need the comfort
To feed the hunger
Because there's strength and speed and numbers
(So heed the thunder)
And watch the lightning cause it's frightening
And so exciting when you see the light before the striking

My poetry is kept
Where I'm socially inept
And so the fingernail of small talk
Is pokin' me to death
I'm supposed to be an extrovert
But I've observed
That I prefer to hide behind having a lack of nerve
He's sort of an attractive turd
A taller midget
But walked with his head tall
So he got all the digits
He never had the gall to talk of his appalling visions
He saw the laws of physics twisted when he closed his eyes
And so he tried
To teach himself to vocalize
What his open mind told him to write in them broken lines
Unorganized quantum physics
Language banging leaps
Awkward angles reached danger
Sprinkled in his tangled speech
Son of a preacher man
Dancing like Peter Pan
Sucking on a thermometer
To see where my fever lands
Should I call the doctor
Or just dial the reefer man
Either plan's decent
I just wish to breathe again

I wish we were in somebody's car

Then we get home
And that would be enough

I'd look at the ceiling
And feel like I was in somebody's arms
Who really loved me
But we won't get that far

[Chorus]

Cause you've got your eyes set on something that I don't see
Whenever you smile it's for something that I don't feel
And one day you'll be so good for somebody
For somebody
And one day you'll make somebody so happy
But it won't be me

Small talk, big nights
You're showing a sign that you're not alright

198,734107,Cattleman’s Gun,Dean Brody,en,country,"Sheepskin cloak across his back
A preacher man with kind old eyes
And a mystery for a past
He said he'd come to teach about
The love of God
But he soon learned what they were missing there
Was justice and the law

There was a cattleman who claimed his clan
Owned all the land around
And any brave fool who that might dispute
He was quick to snuff 'em out
He'd say, ""Take my heed
And you won't pay the price
'Cause honor and a name ain't worth a damn
If you don't have your life.""

He'd say, ""Ain't nobody faster than this cattle man's gun
I'm a rattlesnake on the trigger
Your last stand'll be lyin' in the sand
Fallin' to the slam of my hammer.""

So one man taught forgiveness
While the other taught suffering
The preacher said deliverance
Could be found out on their knees
He said, ""I know that you want justice
And you want blood
But believe me when I say to you
Don't try and be that man's judge
You might also like'Cause ain't nobody faster than that cattleman's gun

One day a young farmer brought his sons to town for feed
And he noticed that the streets were quiet, and he knew what that might mean
The smoke rose in the distance
His farm burned to the ground
He let the fury overtake him
When Cattle Man came back to town

Those boys ran out from behind the crowd
And watched their daddy die
The big man laughed and said, ""Now look at that
Anybody else wanna give it a try?""
Well, the church doors opened with that black cloak flowin' behind the preacher's fiery eyes
He said, ""Your ticket to Hell is a comin' to you
And I got a hollow-point to give you the ride.""

And the only thing faster than the cattle man's gun
Was the preacher's handy finger
He pulled iron from his side and let that bullet fly
Beat the rattlesnake to the hammer

While the preacher embraced forgiveness
Oh, they finally understood
Under that sheepskin cloak of his
Was a history of blood","sheepskin cloak across his back a preacher man with kind old eyes and a mystery for a past he said he'd come to teach about the love of god but he soon learned what they were missing there was justice and the law there was a cattleman who claimed his clan owned all the land around and any brave fool who that might dispute he was quick to snuff 'em out he'd say ""take my heed and you won't pay the price 'cause honor and a name ain't worth a damn if you don't have your life"" he'd say ""ain't nobody faster than this cattle man's gun i'm a rattlesnake on the trigger your last stand'll be lyin' in the sand fallin' to the slam of my hammer"" so one man taught forgiveness while the other taught suffering the preacher said deliverance could be found out on their knees he said ""i know that you want justice and you want blood but believe me when i say to you don't try and be that man's judge you might also like'cause ain't nobody faster than that cattleman's gun he's a rattlesnake on the trigger your last stand'll be lyin' in the sand fallin' to the slam of his hammer"" one day a young farmer brought his sons to town for feed and he noticed that the streets were quiet and he knew what that might mean the smoke rose in the distance his farm burned to the ground he let the fury overtake him when cattle man came back to town those boys ran out from behind the crowd and watched their daddy die the big man laughed and said ""now look at that anybody else wanna give it a try"" well the church doors opened with that black cloak flowin' behind the preacher's fiery eyes he said ""your ticket to hell is a comin' to you and i got a hollow-point to give you the ride"" and the only thing faster than the cattle man's gun was the preacher's handy finger he pulled iron from his side and let that bullet fly beat the rattlesnake to the hammer while the preacher embraced forgiveness oh they finally understood under that sheepskin cloak of his was a history of blood"

The Tater is back with a salty surprise
Strap on your goggles and protect your eyes
From my lyrical explosion, you'll get the notion
That your honey got preggers from the Tater Potion
In perpetual motion, gold records each week
The only gold that you got is from the plaque on your teeth
Bitch, feel the heat, Oatmeal dropping the beats
Got that funky fresh flow from Worthington Street
I got style - so crank up the dial
Let me spit in your club - service with a smile
I'm the rhythm crocodile and I'm worth your while
If you don't think I'm sexy then you're in denial
So watch your mouth, and lower your tone
I'll make your ma cum through the telephone
Are you alone? It's my brother and me

You know the broz gave me another track again
I grabbed a pad and a pen and got back at it to win
The best rhymes of all time will have you clapping my friend
2Pac, Biggie Smalls, J, Nas and Mase
Two, three, four, five, six one is Matt Chase
Girl, look at your face, turn around, skip the record
Shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake that ass, like Michael J. Fox
In a school bus on a bumpy road filled with rocks
My hip hop like a clock, cause I tick til I tock
When it comes to rhyme, they call me Mr. Spock
Because I'm the final frontier of your rapping career
I make you wine with a sign that says the end is near
I write quicker with liquor but I write slicker with beer
I just spit out a hit and make the money appear
My ryhmes are hot, I get paid a lot
I stack more paper than Michael Scott
I even got more Dundies than Michael got
Like I done these bitches, then I forgot
I got a .45 in the truck of my car
I had 45 shots last night at the bar
I know 45 songs on electric guitar
I killed 45 men, only got one scar
There was only one man that I couldn't kill

Twenty for the feds, the rest under my mattress

My car to look like a coffin that's been driven off a cliff
My career like a non-stop graveyard shift

[Verse 1]
Don't clean the crime scene cause time means money
Don't need visine when my eyes seem bloody
I see dead people, but who doesn't?
We walk undercover, deadpan, blending in with other human puppets
Discussing nothing but the sports and weather
If I stare long enough they all morph together
Then I freak out, it'll blow my cover
So I just keep out, no, we don't know each other
I'm on the road to recovery, no GPS
Hoisting my sails ‘till the sea breeze rests
Suck wind if you wanna player hate
Day to day I use my fear of falling asleep to stay awake
I appear psychic-like, but I'm not a psychic

I sift through the ashes in search of surviviors
Digging up the Earth filling urns with dirt
For what it's worth I'm richer than the cemetery soil
I use slant drilling to get my midnight oil
I've been moonlighting as a daydreamer
I'm at the wheel of an eight-seater, (hey) hey mister gatekeeper
Call me key master, no, home owner
One, two and to the three and to the foreclosure
They said the war was over, but we know it wasn't
They wanted more soldiers so we said ''sure, fuck it''
Here's a fresh batch of people with setbacks
The poor folk, in fact they’re all broke cause of your debt traps
Picking the pockets of people who probably needed assistance most
Selling them lies, selling them out, sending them off to a distant coast
Telling them anything anyone left with impossible debt is receptive to
Breaking a promise of negative worth like ''buddy there's nothing left for you''
Gotta buy buy buy to stay alive, they punish the payment delays
Then they charge you for the low balance then they ask ''why didn't you save?''
Too long we took it on the chin, too long we took it to our grave

Sometimes I shoot myself in the foot, I put my foot in my mouth
Clean it while it’s there, and then I suck the bullet out
Reload the weapon, now that's conservation
Stay locked and loaded in a bad conversation
He making blank statements like the surplus of your ammunition's finite
Visionary nothing, you're a man who lives with hindsight
Return to the hive mind and call me back
I’m predicting early that you’ll be the Monday morning quarterback
So cocksure in a culture that gangs up on bully-types
Mob mentality, as if that isn't what a bully's like
Inspiration strikes like an union
I write these lines just to cross 'em, I'm concluding
If my mama don't wanna she never has to work again
Don't ever ask me why I spread myself so thin
I'm finna flirt dirty with the pen and flick my tongue on its bottom
I promise writer's block ain't never been a problem
I'll probably make the columns wanna pop bottles of pain relief
Sometimes it's what you don't say that says the most to say the least
Idle feet are the Devil’s fetish club
A highly exclusive spot none of us are members of
Dante is a scrub - we kicked him out the van and steamrolled him

Emotion (life is a song, a beat, a tempo)
Christ our Savior, adrenaline (adjusted by a situation)
Inspiration, that's music (and that's us)

Yup, that's what I'm talkin about right there (gotta be)
You just can't get that, nowhere but this
Ya know what I'm sayin, this is classic shit
C'mon (Whoaaaaaa)

[Verse 1 - B. Stille]
Groove to the bassline, slap that snare drum
It's music to ya eardrum, snap these back
We ain't goin nowhere hun, keep on dancin
From the mud to the mansion, imagine that
Back rubs, get the body oils, pass me that
Hot tubs, sit yo' ass in that
And only music this good, could make 'em act like that

Aww man, I'm in the zone again, caught up in the whirlwind
And I'm, tryin to make a decision before the whole damn world ends
When, days turn into nights man and burn for twice as long
Cause when my pen brushes the pad with an art form that microphones
And every county 'cross the nation, every house and every basement
Hustlers on street corners live by a beat that's constantly changin
The one thing stays basic, Nappy Roots ain't nothin to play with
Every move is practicin patience, perfectly pacin, how to stay blatant
My sole reason for existence is for all my folks to be a witness
To the movement of this music that this group put out for centuries
And has a life of it's own and prolly gon' take on some different identities
Now who'd a thought we make it happen with this rappin in this industry?
Yup

[Verse 3 - Big V]
Lots of songs, lots of sounds
Bookoo fan, lots of towns
Good and bad time, farewells and makin up
Even feet hurt in the rhythm that run with walkin off
Fights in the club, lullabies to a newborn
Jazz softly enhances gettin grooves on
Tears in a funeral, brought on by a sad song
After Biggie's ""One More Chance"" who was ugly doin?
Sade made me wanna do it in the rain
R. Kelly had me rentin cars to do it in the Range
Breathin is a beat tempo adjusted by adrenaline
Situations, thankin God for the situation

Rushin' through traffic jam to get to emergency room traffic jam, that suppose to be a free clinic
Only to hear if you have or don't have insurance
It ain't nothin' but survival of the fittest
So what they rushin for?
And damn this man at the window is slow
The concept of time has us all fucked, and on top of that
Life ain't nothin' but a traffic jam

Hoping I don't get caught, watch my back
Lost in the traffic, heartless and tragic
Don't wanna get my ass kicked
So I walk in this mindless state
And this, dope make me feel this way
I'll tell ya, Life is a traffic jam, I'm stuck
When will you realize you're fucked?
Don't try to change my ways, I'm hopeless
Victim to the games we play, stay focused
Watch for the crazy ride, don't lie
High till the day we die, it's my life
Tell me if you feel me, I'll tell ya

669,156071,Honey,Bobby Goldsboro,en,country,"But friend it hasn't been too long
It wasn't big
I laughed at her and she got mad
The first day that she planted it, was just a twig

Then the first snow came
And she ran out to brush the snow away
So it wouldn't die
Came runnin' in all excited
Slipped and almost hurt herself
And I laughed till I cried
She was always young at heart
Kinda dumb and kinda smart and I loved her so
And I surprised her with a puppy
Kept me up all Christmas Eve two years ago

And it would sure embarrass her
When I came in from workin' late
Cause I would know
That she'd been sittin' there and cryin'
Over some sad and silly late, late show

And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

And so afraid that I'd be mad
But what the heck
Though I pretended hard to be
Guess you could say she saw through me
And hugged my neck

I came home unexpectedly
And caught her cryin' needlessly
In the middle of the day
And it was in the early Spring
When flowers bloom and robins sing
She went away
And honey, I miss you
And I'm bein' good
And I'd love to be with you
If only I could

One day while I was not at home
While she was there and all alone
The angels came
Now all I have is memories of Honey
And I wake up nights and call her name

Now my life's an empty stage
Where Honey lived and Honey played
And love grew up
And a small cloud passes overhead
And cries down on the flower bed

She'd been drinkin' too much eggnog
And we'd begged her not to go
But she forgot her medication
And she staggered out the door into the snow
When we found her Christmas mornin'
At the scene of the attack
She had hoof prints on her forehead
And incriminating Claus marks on her back

He's been takin' this so well
See him in there watchin' football
Drinkin beer and playin' cards with cousin Mel

Should we open up her gifts or send them back?

Just cover my eyes and give myself a new name

They don't have to hurry, they move in their own way
But I have to choose what to do
How to act, what to think, how to talk, what to say

To greet the teacher Miss Cathleen
First was Kevin, then came Lucy
Third in line was me
All of us were ordinary
Compared to Cynthia Rose
She always stood at the back of the line
A smile beneath her nose
Her favorite number was 20
And every single day
If you asked her what she had for breakfast
This is what she'd say

[Chorus]
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam
Butterscotch clouds and a tangerine
And a side order of ham
And if you set your mind free, baby
Maybe you'd understand
Starfish and coffee
Maple syrup and jam

[Verse 2]
Cynthia wore the prettiest dress
With different color socks
Sometimes, I wondered
If the mates were in her lunch box
Me and Lucy opened it
When Cynthia wasn't around
Lucy cried, I almost died
You know what we found?

Just like the one she draws
On every wall in every school
But it's all right, it's for a worthy cause
Go on, Cynthia, keep singing

Never live for pain, you said
So why are we trapped in this slipstream of me?
We both can't tread water

I used to stack chairs on top of a table
With the mic on that, I'm holdin it to keep It stable
But I feel like I'm movin to a new chapter
So goodbye to the old and welcome what's comin after
The laughter replacing the hatred and anguish
Showing that love translates through any language
I'm blessed cuz to me this shit is basic
And you been tryin for years and still can't taste it
Should've worked harder before you chose to chase it
You second rate maybe it's time for you to face it
You know what they say kid, fuck what you heard
I am the shit and you just a turd
Going hard on a biggie beat just to show
It's about time for you to act like you know

Chorus:
You know very well, who you are
Keep on dreamin baby, you'll be a star
You have a goal, so don't get lazy
(it's all good baby baby)

I'm blasting off, to a whole new galaxy
Maybe earth isn't the place for my fantasy
Because it's been Long way, but I'm just gettin started
I'm about to make everyone who doubted feel retarded
When they see me blow cuz of this freaky flow
Its not an easy road to my own tv show
With some sleezy hoes, I'll turn the nice ones to porn stars
Report cards? Fuck that, I need some sports cars
But first off, I gotta get my shit legitimate
I'm rippin it but still ain't got enough people listening
My skills impeccable I dare you to critic it
Then try and tell me anything other than ""bro you killin it""
And yea I know but I can't be actin cocky
When inside me I know that I'm really Hip hops rocky
See me and you won't expect to be impressed
Hear me and know I'm goin down as one of the best

Of a hip hop legend being crafted outta gold

In my own head thinking
How you could be staring in
Got my number two
And I'm writing you
Contemplating on the paper what I should do
On the fireplace, with the mail man
Should I tell you or should I hold it in
If my heart wasn't in it
Baby you could just forget it
I'd be gone in a New York minute

[Pre-Chorus]
You never give me attention
I know you never had bad intentions for us
So I'm writing you
But I always fail to mention
Cause you know I really don't like to fuss

1364,151349,Giorgio by Moroder, & Daft Punk,en,pop,"When I was fifteen, sixteen, when I really started to play guitar
I definitely wanted to become a musician
It was almost impossible because—it was—the dream was so big
That I didn't see any chance because
I was living in a little town; was studying
And when I finally broke away from school and became a musician
I thought, ""Well, now I may have a little bit of a chance""
Because all I really wanted to do is music
And not only play music, but compose music
At that time, in Germany, in '69, '70, they had already discotheques
So, I would take my car, would go to a discotheque
Sing maybe thirty minutes
I think I had about seven, eight songs
I would partially sleep in the car
Because I didn't want to drive home and that helped me for about
Almost two years to survive in the beginning
I wanted to do an album with the sounds of the '50s
The sounds of the '60s, of the '70s
And then have a sound of the future
And I said, ""Wait a second, I know the synthesizer
Why don't I use the synthesizer which is the sound of the future?""
And I didn't have any idea what to do
But I knew I needed a click, so we put a click on the 24-track
Which then was synced to the Moog Modular
I knew that could be a sound of the future
But I didn't realize how much the impact would be
My name is Giovanni Giorgio
But everybody calls me Giorgio

He was lookin' for a soul to steal
He was in a bind 'cause he was way behind
He was willing to make a deal
When he came across this young man
Sawin' on a fiddle and playin' it hot
And the Devil jumped upon a hickory stump
And said ""Boy, let me tell you what.""

[Verse 2]
""I guess you didn't know it
But I'm a fiddle player too
And if you'd care to take a dare
I'll make a bet with you
Now you play a pretty good fiddle, boy
But give the Devil his due
I'll bet a fiddle of gold against your soul
'Cause I think I'm better than you.""
The boy said, ""My name's Johnny
And it might be a sin
But I'll take your bet, and you're gonna regret
'Cause I'm the best there's ever been.""

[Bridge]
Johnny, rosin up your bow and play your fiddle hard
'Cause Hell's broke loose in Georgia and the Devil deals the cards
And if you win, you get this shiny fiddle made of gold
But if you lose the devil gets your soul

And he said, ""I'll start this show.""

And it sounded something like this:

But sit down in that chair right there
And let me show you how it's done.""

Because he knew that he'd been beat
And he laid that golden fiddle

So you could call me DICK, whatever I still spit a ridiculous script
Bass will make the whole place plus your vehicular flip Ughhh

A sick dose of sick anecdotes spit like I slit throats and rip cantaloupes
Off your vertical cervical vertebrae, Wordplay is so surgical call it scalpel blade

2642,191315,Ill Mind 6: Old Friend,Hopsin,en,rap,"I remember the first time you overdosed
A fuckin' overload on meth
Paramedics saved your ass, you was close to ghost
You never did know which road to go
It’s like you rode the boat
And sailed away and hoped to hit the golden coast
But you sank like the Titanic
The incident, it left your life damaged
And that’s when I panicked
You thought you had it locked
Well, you ain’t on the right planet
If you're tryin' to live your life right, plan it
It’s like your mind vanished, you don’t even know that
I wish that we could go back
'Cause it’s so sad when I tell jokes and you don’t laugh
Like you used to, I really hate to stress it
But you strange to mess with, so I keep my distance
'Cause you always got this blank expression
Like you’re confused and unaware of yo' surroundings
Emotions have gone and no one’s found it
It’s overwhelmin', your momma told you that drugs are bad
But you ain't listen 'til the fire burned your ass
Now you understand

[Hook]
Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world
'Cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home!)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block
Like we used to (Where’d you go?)
I never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future
But I was wrong
You might also like[Verse 2]
I should've stopped you when I had the chance to do so
But back then I had felt like that was too bold
You started hangin' with new folks
And made the drug environment yo' new home
This world is too cold
Could I have prevented this? Who knows?
They convinced you that this shit was cool and hip to do
Sayin' it would lift your mood and make you feel invincible
So you started skippin' school
Hangin' with these wicked dudes
Unaware that when you got older you played a bigger fool
And it’s pitiful, where the fuck they at now?
In they mid-20s passed out inside of a crack house
Back when you met 'em I had doubts
They put you on the bad route, and when you needed they help to pick you up, they fuckin' backed out
They fuckin' got you, I can’t lie, but now your brain's fried
You don’t even act like you’re the same guy
Your momma told you that drugs are bad
But you ain’t listen 'til the fire burned your ass
Now you understand

[Hook]
Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world
'Cause the meth took away my homie
(Give me back my homie, please come home!)
I just wanna chill on the neighborhood block
Like we used to (Where’d you go?)
I never woulda thought my best friend be gone in the future
But I was wrong
[Verse 3]
I ain’t never felt this shit before, it gets me sore
I reminisce on us playin' Nintendo 64
And that Christmas in '97 we got new crispy boards
And we was doin' ollies in my kitchen on the slippery floor
Shit changed and it happened quick, but I can’t forget
That you was the first homie I started rappin' with
You could’ve had half of this back when I had established it
But now I have to sit and feel bad
Look at what your actions did!
Man, you were so outgoin' and so hysterical
Seein' you now is just unbearable, it’s terrible
You should've made your choices wisely
Fuckin' with poison ivy; without your brain, please tell me, what would your point in life be?
It’s a struggle to get your ass to listen
Really hurt me and the rest of your family
With all your bad decisions
We always told you that drugs are bad
But you ain't listen 'til the fire burned your ass
Now you understand
[Hook]
Now you always look like you don’t know me
And I’m mad at the world

Most persons never have a chance to get into a recording studio
Never get to see or hear a record being made
And only experience the finished product
Until now, you had no way of learning
Of the anormous complexity of the recording process
And this limits appreciation of music
We can't hope to explain all the complexity
But we hope to give you some insight
For the musical forces at work
And have a good time in the process

Born in the shadow of the palace with full beards

3512,322813,On The Via Dolorosa,Johnny Cash,en,rock,"We are on the Via Dolorosa the way of the Cross having just left the Praetorium
Where Pilate said to Christ I washed my hands off the matter
And turned him over to the people and told them to do what they would with him
There's no traffic here the streets's very narrow
Little children playing along the street the street's about ten feet wide
You see the third station of the Cross
Where Christ almost fell under the weight of the Cross
He's kneeling and the fourth station of the Cross over there
Over forty or fifty feet farther toward Calvary
Where His mother came up to Him and said my Son what's happened
And she sees Him kneeling under the heavy weight of the Cross too
Continuing on now toward Calvary from the fourth station of the Cross
We left the Praetorium where Christ was sentenced and where he was turned over
To the Jewish people and they were offered Barabbas and they said
No give us Christ we'll crucify him
Following along the stations of the Cross passing station No 5
And they say at this point that Simon a Cyrenean coming out of the country
On him they laid the Cross they made him bear it for Jesus
And they continued on the way of the Cross as we are now
Leaving place No 5 toward Calvary it's a long long way from here
You can see standing here between station No 5 and No 6
Two hundred yards at least up the steps toward Calvary's hill
All along it's a very narrow street ten or twelve feet wide
Shops on each side little children playing old men and women
Carrying their bread dressed in their long robes
Just as they did two thousand years ago
The music here in the background is a radio playing (is that an Arab station)
Still continuing up the way of the Cross toward Calvary
The voices you hear in the background are pilgrims from all over the world
All along the Via Dolorosa here there are beggars (I suppose mostly Arab beggars)
Passing station No 10 continuing on to Calvary they are all along the way
They say that they are all blind
They say that the reason there are so many blind along
This part of the country is because of the dust
Everywhere the wind is blowing and the dust is flying
And of course there are germs in the dust that diseases their eyes
And the dust itself puts them out
On the way to Calvary we pass another beggar sitting along the way
All kinds of shops pilgrims continuing on the same way we're going
Now closer to Calvary the way really gets crowded

If I don't fuck with you
I don't mind you knowing I don't fuck with you

[Verse  1]
Breaking down a key of coke, I ain't never seen a boat
Khaza got circumcised thinkin I'mma need a load
Boobie he a shooter hit the top of your medulla
From a scooter with a ruger I don't think he even need a scope
Attending college been a goal that I'm after
Evaded doin' life without parole wearin' shackles
I'm only fucking with what matters
A washed up rapper talking trash doesn't matter
Front windshield of the car went in shatters
My nigga brains blown out layin' in my lap
Told God take me, everybody blamed me
Praying till I'm prayed out won't bring him back

[Bridge]
They say my life is amazing
Funny been a question kinda wonder how I made it
Forest Gump and I got something in common
The world treat you different when brilliant

We ain't booted off a molly, we don't do shrooms
All we do is pass gas loud, excuse who?
Twin-turbo 911 make it vroom vroom
We in all black, my mechanic, make the tool move
Say you sip lean, yeah, I do too
I ain't tryna hit your cup, nigga, do you
I'm Michael Jackson, I'm reincarnated
I channel this spirit like Ali the greatest
Medicinal marijuana, am I medicated?
Aerosmith jaded
She looked like Nala when she got on top me
I gazed in her eyes and responded
Can we go half on a baby?
Broke another fingernail scratching up my back
Navel was to the ceiling when I'm pushing on her pelvis
See my tattoo of Elvis when I'm tearing up her cat
She tapped

[Hook]
I'm a perfect imperfection
My craft has been perfected
I just need affection
Emotionally, Imma introvert but it comes off as aggression
No one understand me and everybody can't be slow
It's refreshing to find someone who think like me so I can't be wrong
I'm a perfect imperfection and I don't find interest in the radio
So everytime I get high I watch the time pass by like away we go
Is it okay to cry when you're dying inside?
Seem like codeine is the one thing that help take my mind from the lies
[Verse 3]
Point the flame at my brain with the full clip
Drake said Gates do his thing he don't bullshit
All you other niggas rap about is bullshit
Studio on drugs and you get all in your feelings
Look into your eyes nigga you ain't ever lived it
But always talking cooking dope nigga ever had heart ache
Ever lost money learning how to cook oil based
Ever grind hard tryna pay for your lawyer?
Get him paid off and you still go to jail
And that bitch that you love don't pick up when you call her
Fuckin' with your nigga when you get out and you dog her
Going with your mood with a nigga you don't argue
Came here to die in the game I'm retarded
Know its got a name I ain't knowing what to call it
Mama 3 way the call chopping game, me and 40
Freeman I look to you nigga and I love you
Know you lost your parents but with me you got a brother
Malaki and Chris Sprite all same trap
Cousin Lil Quick telling me he wanna rap
Uptown Beezy the white house administration
Get the paper had to see Tyrese in a scrap
When his seatbelt strap make it hard to lean back
Sittin' up straight in the car with the shades on
Young Seven with the jensen and my main man gone
I was doing time up in rivers when he came home
Now I'm waiting on a nigga for the get out of line
No drive by we jump out and dump where you grind
Excuse me I meant to say where you spend time
You too scared to hustle you just wasting time
I used to spend nights with Khalil and Jaquincy
And his brother fucked with the ones who against me
Stop making threats cause I swear I hate livin'
You say you don't like me well shut up or kill me
Well shut up or kill me
You say you don't like me well shut up or kill me

And never go roaming out after the boys
But would sit by her fireside so bright
My wife, she is one of a different kind
Often caused me a lot of grief
She's oft' from her home
And she leaves me alone
To rock all our babies to sleep

Just the other night while out for a walk
I happened to stroll down the street
And to my surprise
I saw with me eyes
My wife with a man of six feet
She says, ""It's no harm don't raise no alarm
Don't make any fuss on the street.""
She tickled my chin
Told me to go in
And rock all our babies to sleep

I remember one night when I came back home
I came in as quiet as a lamb
They must have had comp'ny for when I walked in
I heard the back door when it slammed
I walked right in and looked all around
I never thought that she would cheat

It’s too empty, this world, as they say you get that one somebody
And honestly honey, I think we may have found something
You’re fresh to death, since the day we met
Keeping me hanging off your minty breath; and the cute way that you dress
We’re not very decisive, nothing is ever decided
We just live life and the shit that we tend to do is priceless
You’re the finest thing, I’ve had the pleasure of holding
You’re the greatest person, I’ve had the patients of knowing
Sometimes we get jealous, but nothing we do is controlling
You’ve taken all of my heart, but baby it’s not stolen
I’ll keep us rolling, I tell you facts, no hiding
Behind these contacts, I got no time, for lying
There’s nothing you lack, I’m falling, so call me
It’s a bit late to confess this, so I’ll text you in the morning

(Chorus) I’m love sick and you’re my remedy
I’m fucked up and you’re my therapy
I’ll hit the notes if you’re the melody
I’m in too deep, you’ve taken over me X2

(Verse) When I lay next to you, I know you’re the one to protect
I never did expect someone like you, just so, perfect
When I reflect on my mistakes, there’s only one empty space
I haven’t fucked shit up with you, and I never intend too
You keep me grounded; I’m at my best when you are near
You’ll stick around, is all I ever need to hear
When times get hard I think of you and there’s nothing to fear
It’s profound the effect love has when it surrounds you here
Nothing is better than being considered your company;
You could never say “I love you baby” subtly
Cause when I have it, it reminds me I’m somebody
And I’ll give you all my love and care abundantly
Suddenly shits moving so quick, my heart starts to pound, I hope that you stick, by my side, no jumping this ship, my heart strings flex, don’t let them rip, give me the time, to make you mine, just give me a sign, you’ll be at my side, just hold on tight. Cause we’re bound to fly

It’s for the love
Cause we love you so much
Keep it real
I don’t feel what you feel though
You don’t feel what I feel so
It all started out

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
See first I had patience, and a nigga had energy
But now I'm weak, definitely
Pedi to the pedal, you finna speed
You remind me of, of my Jeep
But off in the future, and what it’s finna be
All your memories can become enemies
So let’s intercede I know you in the seat
But let’s get outta that, before it’s injuries
[Chorus: Nikki Jean & Lupe Fiasco]
At first I had patience
But then that patience turned to waiting
And then that waitin’ turned to wasting my time, my time, my time
And then that wasting turned to hating
And then that hating got to racing
All around my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind
So before we hit a wall, heartbreak, and it crashes

But you overlooked me somehow
Besides, you had too many boyfriends to mention
And I played my guitar too loud

Never imagined I'd make it this far

[Verse 1]
Rage colored lilies, brave covered in pity
Lights smother this city
I pray he doesn't forget me, I pray he doesn't forget me
That lonely night in November
When we fell into the hands of the coldest day in December
Then became the product of the trust that we had lost and found
Got you deep in the emotion just to watch you drown
And I had never left the land’s sand
Cause I was busy building castles for a dead man
Shouldn't have taken my eyes off you
I shouldn't have straddled the lines crossed too
And now I've been searching but can't find you
Hence me being lost since you're the one I'm entwined to
So, is love the picture that we’ve tainted now?
No, Am I still with you when I ain't around?
Am I the subject you tip-toe or walk around?
And if this love is on the ledge I’m trying to talk it down

See, we were deep sea divers
And I was focused on survival
And death does you part when you're focused on its rival
Defibrillator love, I'm just focused on revival
You could, you could put your hands in mine
And we'll walk through the sand, in the sands of time
Until we paint the end of this love scene
Until I'm laid to rest in your blood stream
Until I hear the strings of your heart playing
Until I hear the things you are not saying
Until I find out what it really means
And hopefully it's everything it really seems

Never dreaming in their joy
Of the fate that they would meet

But their joys all were blighted
They began to scream and rage
When a lantern fell that evening
Streaming fire upon the stage

493,696661,8th of November,Big & Rich (Ft. Kris Kristofferson),en,country,"Said goodbye to his mama as he left South Dakota
To fight for the red, white, and blue
He was 19 and green with a new M-16
Just doin' what he had to do
He was dropped in the jungle where the choppers would rumble
With the smell of napalm in the air
And the sergeant said ""Look up ahead""
Like a dark evil cloud, 1,200 came down on him and 29 more
They fought for their lives but most of them died in the 173rd Airborne

On the 8th of November the angels were cryin'
As they carried his brothers away
With the fire rainin' down and the hell all around
There were few men left standing that day
Saw the eagle fly through a clear blue sky

Now he's 58 and his pony tail's gray
But the battle still plays in his head
He limps when he walks but he's strong when he talks

And he ties it on one time a year
And remembers the fallen as he orders a tall one
And swallows it down with his tears

You can say what you want but try to think it my way
And say, ""Oh, oh, oh, this wicked campaign""
I said, ""Oh, oh, oh, this was not my plan""

Well, you know I'm a bastard and we only just met
I guess I probably shouldn't wear this big old sign 'round my neck
I've still got some opinions that I'm willing to claim
I'm gonna carry them around like they're some wicked campaign

I started the debate, but now I'm sure I can't win
I should probably just exit the same way I came in
Well counted calculator, you didn't calculate this

You know the usual girl, I'll take it on the rocks
You can catch me here every night like I'm on the clock
I know this neighborhood and all the local mom and pops
We own these blocks like prisoners that were on the rock
But this ain't Alcatraz, this is an alkie trap
Bar hoppers and big talkers and starting tabs
Hand shakes with fake smiles and shark attacks
Networking and head jerk gettin lots of crap
Huh, some of these cats I went to school with 'em
Run into 'em they be telling me that I'm doing it
They give me props, but it's hard to find the truth in it
Green bottles in hand with devils juice in 'em
Sixth street down six feet we digging deep
Like we own the place, know my face, get in free
The wasted minutes of our lives is the hidden fee
But who am I to preach

Yeah they know me around here
Call me the hometown hero
Holla when I roll down Pico
Let's get another round here
Homie drinks on me

I seen them younguns they tatted with town pride
With not the slightest clue what's happening outside
Saying that they run shit, fighting about dumb shit
When they not one fifth of the man, ain't that some shit
We live our lives on the fly, we just roll the dice
With no idea you're a grain in the bowl of rice
The OGs told me nothing no advice
My closest friends left me hanging on the coldest nights
Where the women and pretty linen are overpriced
Gold diggers, their goal's becoming trophy wives
Tell me how that easy money make you feel girl
It's gon' be painful when you come into the real world
I ain't lying you a dime though
But you're drinking yourself down to a five though
Going out every night, you a wine-o
The same faces all the places that I go

This town will anchor you down, and never set you free

[Verse 1]
I been stressin' it's a blessin' that I'm still walking these days
I'm a stray with no collar I'm a dollar short, day late
Suffocate, hear me rape, my own mind with a damn vibrate-
OR not its your choice, but I'm drowning in my voice
What's the reason got me bleedin' gettin' caught up in the ignorance
But the catch to it is I started this with a pen and pape and the hope to spit
Now I sit, here I am, dying inside filled with emptiness
And its how I'm meant to live See me smile through the midst of it - Zell

Here's protection, told myself, its the way to keep my health
So I step up to the plate fuck the love I'm about that hate
Fuck the wealth of the spirit liquor fills the fuckin void
But emotions taking over and I'm so fucking annoyed
So much noise, fills my head, Romeo's voice is what I dread
So I'm sippin the bottle to drown out the nonsense
Diving much deeper into my subconscious

Yo, Spin, once again help me get this crowd on its feet
So we can set it off
I've got your back, Salt, you know I'm never soft
Yo, where's your records at?
Right beside me
Ready to give a scratch?
Yep, like poison ivy

It's the Nineties, the year for change, can you prove it?
I made this beat, I'm an Invincible, and I produced it
It's in my soul to roll and flow, take control
Sold the show, can go like a pogo stick
Hot hit, dop, dip, rock, rip, don't shop on my hit list
Cuz I can be a witch if
They music is cool, and it can calm the savage beast
Then we got plenty of beats for the beasts to eat
A party animal that's livin' rather large, in fact
Take out the camera, Salt, (Why?) I wanna picture that
Make sure it's focused or you may only not have noticed
Before I cut up a jam I yell a ""hocus pocus""
And right before your eyes you'll understand the name
Musicans and magicians are usually the same
And the fame, proclaim, obtains, the stain will gain a rain
That pours, it soars my brain to yours
Ordained by law to train the poor
I'll make sure that there ain't gonna be no more

Anything that's tragic relates to black
Coincidental? (No) Here's an example, Jack
Words as ancient as fossils or artifacts
Black Sunday or Monday
Black tongues or lungs may cause a black sleep
Why say black sheep?
Black sabbath is evil, black market illegal
A black widow is deadly, black potion ain't healthy
See, some try to say dark-skinned men ain't sexy true
Darker the cherry, you know how sweet will be the juice
Music's the only thing that brings the dead right back to life
Have faith and it will guide you through the night just like a light
Never say Salt steered you wrong inside a concert hall
My crystal ball can see the future, to the beat y'all

In magic, a dimension of sight and sound
Where people see in only shades of brown
And reality is the same as a fantasy

Not me, I want variety in my society
Where I can change if I don't like what I see, you see
This is a woman speakin' bringin' door-to-door, seekin'
Tranquilty, that abilty will keep on repeatin'

And I don't give a fuck about any of you limp bizkit funny boys!

[Intro]
I was on some all in together
Whether whore, whether beggar
Whether rat or weathered leper
Come and cut this edge a second
We could build a better network
Without all the yes sir, yes sir

[Verse]
Post cannons up
Pull the pulse up outcha mans and what
Dick and Jane escape into the arcane where the phantoms fuck
Itchy skin he sits inside shifty village snitching
Grin and gargle when they argue happy
Are you happy? Sit and spin (sink or swim)
He kick his fins and wave his bony arms around
For guards who beg your pardon
While the arson burns your harvest down
What a darling town
What a snarling partridge farm
The bars are like a car with clowns
The parks are like a garbage barge
But still it was our parthenon
We part to train tomorrows argonauts and archers
With lungs that match their markers
Like army parkas marching
Through the marsh with buzzing sparklers
To carve apart the harpies
And disarm the budding marksmen
Are you charged up?
This be the trench foot kicking
Through the ten cook kitchen
Spoiled beef and chicken
We gobbled up the chemical in heaps, in new relief
Was thirty minutes past
The chalky tablets melting in our teeth
A dagger in the back became a fad to swagger jack
With no medicinal maggots to lap the gashes aftermath
These are the crazers of the Benadryl nation
That'll steal the very bacon
Off your plate, thats so raven
Been jittery killer-the artillery parties
Lit up like symphony of pretty Ataris
Fitting the knitting needle splintered through the kewpie
Duke(?)
I speak in a dead language New York is hollerin' through me
Note the lazy foe be seven clicks outside the poppy fields
Telescopes and coffee spills
Folding chairs and orange peels
Peanut shells and all is fair
In loving brawlers crawling through the august air
That's the muggy handicap we all must share
And morning smells like blood worms
In the beaks of the very falcon
But how can arrested splendors
Of wretched sleep walk the palate
Palpating hearts like woe to you rascal eddy hazels
Which one of you bitches would flip the table?

It leaves you wanting more

Livin' down on the farm
We were told that the city
Could only bring us harm
""How far is the city?"", somebody said
And, ""Oh, that's a great big town""
And Barbara said, ""Why, it's a million miles""
And the story got around

[Chorus:]
It's a million miles to the city
From the hills and valleys we know
It's a million miles to the city
And someday we all wanna go

[Verse 2:]
There was a town nearby but a town is a town
And the city well, that's something else
Our daddy had been to a city
But he never was much help
Why the buildings are taller than Oak trees
Ah, but we knew better than that
Ain't nobody could climb that high
The cities were wide and flat

Well, now time has passed and we have grown
And traveled far and wide
The cities have changed the kids we were

But I'd love to go back to those hills again
To the boy I used to be
Where the leaves and the wind and the whippoorwills
Were part of the land like me

My oh my what a G-U-Y
Got me in trouble like a D-U-I
Brain cells booked themselves a flight
Senseless since you caught my eye
Think this one's my last lover
She says, ""You can't fool me I'm your mother""
Apple don't fall far from the tree
Take it from me
Baby girl you're a runner
I swear it's a curse
Cause I meet so many men
And I never find the one in the city of Japan
Sucks so bad cause I really wish I wasn't in a rush but I am
If I just took a minute to be honest with myself
I will find I wasn't really ready cause I'm not
It's all a silly game and I'm only talking to the same boy cause he's hot

I don't wanna fall in love, I don't wanna fall in love

Carrying my mommy lump

Restless spirit gone eat me alive
I don't know why I always find
A reason to be out like a power line

And I never find the one in Miami or L.A
Don't know where they hide
I've been searching high and low

I stay breaking hearts
I could really use a minute to myself for a change

Agony is my old best friend

Would have needed someone else

So I'mma put me first cause I never really do

But I'm, the rhyme don taking out imposters
Proper with these fat tips, practice good posture
Not a, liquor sipper drug-transacter
Rapper-turned-actor nor be a lyrical slackard

Scoop these, ramsacked tracks like jewel thieves
Break it down to the matter cause the chatter's on squeeze

LADIES AND GENTS!!! We represent and take offense
To all the nonsense, here to resurrect like Com Sense
We rhymin fresh, nonetheless, don't stress the messengers
Boucning to the beat like big breastses
After this rap skit, kids go back and practice, lackin this
Lyrical tactics when they match wits, who the?
Captains over the boom bips
Rippin over the music when I use

Call them cops and I know they all hate it
With a chopper got my homies all faded
Either way it all comes down to shots
And we ain't talking drinks when we say they getting wasted

[Verse 1]
My people ain't stupid
We using this riff raff and confusion
To get gas while be step back, click clack and shoot it
Better get back with that misconclusion
That rat-at-at-at-at, pick and choose it
Who's next to lose it
Those bullets never cared about who you is
The streets of Detroit, welcome to my city
Hell comes for the many whose bail was unforgiving
When L rumming the Henny, prevailed into a killing
The jealousy turned felony, let 'em be under sixteen
Now we have just credibly witnessed another incredibly sickening
Melody from the seventh key and sixth string
Street guitarist, I used to dream of leaving memories
But like an easy target, ain't none of y'all gone miss me
I'm just a minority painting a picture formally
Satan will get you, but the scriptures what gave me authority
Sitting, waiting there cordally
I was six on the porch any
Day I could witness different decisions devoid morally
At night night time, I go five-o fight crime
It's apparent they don't like my kind
No parent in their right mind like mine
Wanna hear about a disappearance or the death of their child in their lifetime
Like my middleschool friends where nine died
I was like my God, did I end up alive just so I could sit and write rhymes?
Nope, better get past the music
You sit back and cruise, while I spit raps, the truth is
Plain when I kick facts, mainly cause the shoe fits
Alluding alluded statements that gold chains enunces
Which means the gangster lie in bars
They got their head bopping translates to iron bars
They got my people dead or boxed in
More than twelve rounds, Philly shells, great punches
And locked in a cell doesn't mean they taking numbers

To wreck the competition
During a mission
Burning bridges
That once let in the kids that gave me emotional stitches
In my composition
I wrote hooks and swings
Seem more real then what literature can sting
I wasn’t picked on a lot
Cause of my buff nerd status
Put me on the list in don’t f with bracket
I used to imagine
That I could do the impossible
They called it impossible so I wanted to go
Do as many things as possible
For me that is…
A workaholic that’s a compliment
For me that is…
My nappy hair caressed by white girls
Yes this kid…
I heard go figure a lot
So in my figment-tation
My thoughts were the keystone
That hold the doorway open
I walked in
Still don’t understand yet what I created
Sooner or later
Friends might pick up on my newfound behavior
I used to be candy snatchin’
In my young dreams Vince Lombardi trophy patchin’
Figuring these magazines ensured these fantasies
Too good to be true
That’s what it seems
But still these instructors in different categories
Be telling me the same story
That I withhold so much potential
Coming to a new threshold

Round and round let go, change up the same ol' thing
With these memories and moments that all these people bring
So let's sing with the birds and get lost in thought
‘Cause we all get that feeling when we paid the wrong cost
Yeah, let’s set it off that standards are skewed
And we are just a few dudes who went past curfew
Who knew, that we could move like m from mc
That crowd, I wanna forget ‘em and just do me

[Verse 2: Definition]
Now I ain’t the optimistic type
Glass half empty
Mind fucked up so I dare ya try and tempt me
Only sixteen but I feel like I am forty-six
Already suffered my whole life
I feel like this is fuckin’ it
Amazing things could happen
But I could really give a shit
Bitches lined up out the door tryin’ hop on Deffie’s Dick
And I could care less
These bitches only hoes
I already hit my prime when I was 14 old
And ever since then life seems so dull
Popped everything fuckin’ Molly ‘till I roll
But that’s no longer my life
Been sober 60 days
Getting oxycontin out my system never felt so strange
And I thought I lost my motivation
Beard growing to the floor
Crazy shit I’m contemplating
I don’t speak of anymore
But I’mma come back like I gotta fighting chance
Break yo fuckin’ head, neck, and nose
Put you in a trance
Have you rushed away, ambulance to the doctor
And I mean it when I say bet ‘cha wish I shot ya
Fuckin’ with these cannons
A mistake that’ll end yo’ life
Me and my boy Trey, crazier then Wesley Snipes
Chop you up, butcher’s knife
Dismember your whole body
Wrap you in a garbage bag
Send you to yo’ mommy
‘Cause I’m crazier then shit
And I don’t give a fuck
And if you don’t like the way I rhyme then you could get fucked
[Chorus: Trey]
That crowd, I wanna forget ‘em and just do me

At half past papa he’s ready to go
He jumps in his pirogue headed down the bayou
He’s got fishing lines strung across the Louisiana rivers
Gotta catch a big fish for us to eat
He’s setting traps in the swamp catching anything he can
He’s gotta make a living, he’s a Louisiana Man

Ill give you a daisy a day, dear
Ill give you a daisy a day
Ill love you until the rivers run still
And the four winds we know blow away
They would walk down the street in the evenin
And for years I would see them go by
And their love that was more than the clothes that they wore
Could be seen in the gleam of their eyes
As a kid they would take me for candy
And I loved to go taggin along
Wed hold hands while we walked to the corner
And the old man would sing er his song
Ill give you a daisy a day, dear

Ill love you until the rivers run still
And the four winds we know blow away
Now he walks down the street in the evenin
And he stops by the old candy store
And I somehow believe hes believin
Hes holdin er hand like before
For he feels all her love walkin with him
And he smiles at the things she might say

And gives her a daisy a day

[Verse 1: Tom DeLonge]
I can't get my feet up off the edge
I kinda like the little rush you get
When you're standing close to death
Like when you're driving me crazy
Hold on as we crash into the earth
A bit of pain will help you suffer
When you're hurt, for real
'Cause you were driving me crazy

[Pre-Chorus: Tom DeLonge]
Bite your lips, your words a robbery
Do you grin inside? You're killing me
All along we talked of forever
I kinda think that we won't get better
It's the longest start, but the end's not too far away
Did you know? I'm here to stay

[Chorus: Mark Hoppus]
We'll stagger home after midnight
Sleep arm in arm in the stairwell
We'll fall apart on the weekend
These nights go on and on and on

Cause you're the one I miss
And it's driving me crazy

Givin' in, drifting off
A boy lit a cigarette
While the girl closed the door
These hopeless romantic fools
Won’t be lovers no more

But see how the waves are rushing in
And see how the waves are washing off
Leaving the shore so pure
Cleansing until it’s white as snow

A dear's gasping for air
It’s made its last mistake
A fool for old nature’s rules
Drifts away in the wake of the dawn
A car leaves the front yard
Of a house she calls home
Her man won’t be back again
Won’t be home anymore

But see how the waves are rushing in
And see how the waves are washing off

Nothing left for me to feel

Cross the sky
Under the haze

In the morning time
We didn't think
About our days

The wind was blowing
Through our hair
As we lied down

And we could feel
Under our backs
That the earth was round

Lazy today
Lazy tonight
And later on

All we had to do
Was nothing at all

I'm embarrassing punks
Starvin' like a pack of some mutts
Know exactly what's up

But hittin' up the rich and corrupt? Now that's a Hunger Strike

There ain't nothin' nice these cats can say since back in the day
I've been nicer than cats my age
Now I'm back to take what's rightfully mine (get it)
Any track or stage or cipher I shine
It's a brief introduction for those that don't know
Just a small fast set of the whole arsenal
Still I have sweat, tears, heart and soul
And that's a promise
Every single bar is gold

The history of the world is the history of wars
It is the history of people preying upon people and people resisting predation It's a struggle of competing societies to survive in a world of natural, biological and socio-political strife
That is why it is so difficult to turn a single page of history without reading of war, combat, strife, revolution, uprising, invasion, insurrection, strike or some form of violence
The great heroes of history are the mass murderers of history
Alexander the great, Charlemagne, Genghis Khan, and on and on and on...
During the first three quarters of this century alone, more than 70 million people were killed as a results of wars, revolutions, insurrections, rebellions, massacres, assassinations, executions, exterminations, genocides, and so forth

But is my soul this? (Something for you haters)

Some, if any, think we equal not 'cause God does, but 'cause laws force them
But what are laws if you don't enforce 'em?
Unless you get it on tape
It's more suspense and mystery than a Presidio tape
Investigation more cartoon than a kid video tape
It's civil liberties rape in Statue of Liberty shape
The American offense make you watch for the head fake
Well, down with Sam, I ain't
Three seconds in this paint will make any outside shooter faint
Wait for you to blink
So when you wake up and can't wake up, you know exactly who to thank

But if you wanna get your kicks
From a boy who knows the tricks
If it's love you want, baby, that's me

Who's way above the mass
Well, I'm not the right person obviously
But if you want to get that glow

So take your time and think it over
Don't do anything that's rash
Don't go for a guy with flash
'Cause love will last longer than cash

So if it's love you want, baby, come on, let's go home

When they wrote the dictionary and they wanted to know about love
It was me that Mr. Webster and all them other fellas was thinking of
Cause I put the ""L"" in love and the ""X"" in ecstasy
So if it's love you want, baby, that's me

I've made love in San Francisco sitting on the Golden Gates
And I'm known from coast to coast in all the 48 states
I've got all lovers confused tryin' to learn the methods I use
So if it's love you want, baby, that's me

My father was a lover way before my time
But the method he used was that old outdated kind
The technique I use would run him right out of his mind
So if it's love you want, baby, that's me

So take your time and think it over
Don't do anything that's rash
Don't go for a guy with flash

If Columbus had complied this old world might still be flat
Nothin' ventured, nothin' gained
Sometimes you've got to go against the grain

Well, I've been accused of makin' my own rules
There must be rebel blood just a-runnin' through my veins
But I ain't no hypocrite, so what you see is what you get
And that's the only way I know to play the game
Ol' Noah took much ridicule for buildin' his great ark
But after forty days and forty nights he was lookin' pretty smart
Sometimes it's best to brave the wind and rain
By havin' strength to go against the grain

But they're worried If they're gonna sink or swim

And they are a little scared to go out on a limb
But if you're gonna make a difference, if you're gonna leave your mark

1079,953121,All My Children Of The Sun,Tim Robbins,en,pop,"The navigator said to the engineer
I think our radio's dead
I can hear but I can't send
And there's bad weather up ahead
The pilot said to the co-pilot
Our right engine's gone
But if we can make it over these mountains
Perhaps I can set her down
All my children of the sun
Five hundred miles from nowhere
We belly landed on a river
We bid a quick goodbye
To that ship of silver
Twenty-five piled out the window
Twenty reached the shore
We turned to see our metal bird
Sink to rise no more
All my children of the sun
We found some floating logs
We found some sharp stones
We cut some vines and made a raft
It was our only hope
The navigator said he thought there was
A town somewhere downstream
So now each man tried his best
To paddle as a team
All except one young guy
Who kept arguing with the navigator
He said he'd read about a waterfall
We would come to sooner or later
At a river's bend he persuaded us
To bring our raft to beach
But a search party found the river smooth
As far as eye could reach
All my children of the sun
Once again he persuaded us to stop
We cursed at the delay
Once again we found the river
Flowing on the same old way
We said, ""Shut up your arguing
You give us all a pain
Why don't you pitch in and do your part
Be constructive for a change?""
All my children of the sun
Still egghead kept on talking
In the same long winded way
We said, ""If you won't paddle
Get the hell out of our way""
We told him to go sit
Far back at the stern
Then we strained to paddle harder
And then the river made a turn
All my children of the sun
One paddler heard sound of tapping
And what he saw, when he did turn
Was egghead with a sharp stone
Cutting the vines that bound the stern
With a cry of rage the paddler
Leaped up to his feet
He swung his long pole
Knocked egghead into the deep
But now the logs were splaying out
The raft had come unbound
Like mad we paddled for the shore
Before we all would drown
All my children of the sun
A search party went out to find more vines
To tie the raft up tight
In twenty minutes they returned
Their faces pale with fright
They said a quarter mile down the river
We found a waterfall
It's over a hundred feet in height
It could have killed us all
All my children of the sun
And that is why on the banks
Of a far off wilderness stream
Which none of us, none of us
Will ever see again
There stands a cross for someone
Hardly older than a boy
Who we thought was only
Trying to destroy

Check it, I saw my life flash before my eyes
And I was nearly blinded, alone at the top
Solitary confinement, yea solitary confinement
All alone I'm about to blow, clear the sinus
Shoot, reminiscing on my college days
Marijuana, old e, lemon lime powerade
Hit class, hour late, get back, marinate
Lure honey ova with a big glass of Alize
Double take with a whip lash, model shape
I work her out and give her protein powder shake
Simple days I appreciate them well
Have you ever felt you're meant for something greater than yourself?
Man, never believed in no religion
But the way I bless the track like a priest or a reverend
Does it mean I go to heaven?
You should lock me in a booth
Went from red label, black label, Johnny Walker Blue
To that single malt 62 Dalmore (whoo)
I only drink it neat though, Voli think in deep flows
Those other iTunes you might as well delete those
Bet I take you to a higher level like a cheat code

[Verse 2]
Nouveau Classique, Glass doors, look at me closely
You see the signs of the pain in my eyes
I remain petrified and afraid that I'll lie in the grave with no pride to my name
Hope I die with a claim that I shined
As a king and that I lived a life of passion
Now will I see beyond the fame
When those camera lights are flashing
I don't know, will I change? Probably so
You can ask Lady Gaga see that fame is a monster
But to the ones who support I'll take you with me to glory
And hm to the ones who never paid attention, I'm sorry
These rappers tryna ride, looking like some stowaways
That new trash ain't touchin my old throwaways
Trini boy, six three, tall drink of water
She tryna check my package out like a shipment order
She on her knees like she praying, diocese
I can eat long as kitty's hair short, Siamese
No sex less we both in it for the long haul
Otherwise they tryna trap a brother like an arm bar

And fuck fame, that killed all my favorite entertainers

Six years old, I tried my first pair of Jordans on
(""Momma, can you carry me?"")
It was late in the fall
I caught a glimpse of my first love, my God
(""Momma, can you carry me?"")
Knees hit the floor, screams to the Lord
Why they had to take my ma? (""Momma, carry me?"")
To the early morn' (""Momma, can you carry me?"")
To the early morning (""Momma, can you carry me?"")
[Verse 1]
Hey, hey, hey, gather round, hustlers, that's if ya still livin'
And get on down before the judge give the sentence
A few more rounds before the feds come and get you
Is you gon' smile when your date gets issued?
You know them feds taking pictures
Your mom’s in prison, your father need a new kidney
Your family’s splitting, rivalries between siblings
If cash ain’t king, it's damn sure the incentive
And good riddance

[Interlude]
""Is the element of danger an important factor for the members of your peer group?""
""Yes, you might say that. Why don’t you give it a try and find out for yourself?""

[Verse 2]
'Bout the year Drizzy and Cole dropped
Before K.Dot had it locked
I was sleeping on the floor, newborn baby boy
Tryna get my money pot so wifey wouldn’t get deported
Cursing the heavens, falling out of orbit
Tryna roll this seven, tryna up my portion
What about your goals? What about your leverage?
So they don’t force you into some hole
What’s the meaning of my fortune reading?
When I crack the cookie, all it said was “keep dreaming”
When I look at my tree, I see leaves missing
Generations of harsh living and addiction
I came to visit during the seven-year stint
But they wouldn’t let me in because my license suspended
Now I’m scraping the pennies just to kiss you on your cheek
It’s gonna be a couple weeks before I get it
I know you miss me

With no idea where she has gone
Got her suitcase all packed up
In the back of the pickup

Westbound she knows

When the sun finally rose
And man, she's just running
It don't matter where
She figures she'll know where she is when she's there

And she didn't leave nothin' she can't do without
That's enough reason for leavin', no doubt
She rolls down the window, turns up a song
Laughs at the weather and says, ""Hello, I'm gone""

Long before you realised that you'd lost your way
You had already swallowed it

In all that you're confined

Widow maker, camouflaged wind-breaker
Savage apparel for the hazardous Pharaoh
AOTP keep your bullet trapped in a barrel
Go ahead and circle your wagons while I'm reversing your patterns
Ski mask flow, I do everything in murderous fashion (bloaw!)
Perfect assassin, ghost protocol, Ethan Hunt
Demigod putting bodies in the trunk

[Verse 2: Ill Bill]
Powdered out, Coka Nostra, scraping up the white lines
Outta town local yokels, hating from the sidelines
Light up a murder verse, fire like a burning church
Microphones sorta like a scalpel when the surgeon works
Gimme perverted nurses and librarians
Knowledge born through caesarian, Luciferian
Billy Crystal, who compares to him?
Shooting Romans out their chariots, always prepared to win

[Verse 3: Godilla]
Rise of the phoenix, or an iron butterfly
Evidently proof our legacy couldn't die
No shook and jive, I took my time
Don't look behind, from books from lines, no hooks, just rhymes
A simpler time defined, by vinyl and boom box
Write a banger like the heat outta the shoe box
Technology killing the art like Suge did 2Pac
So I brought freedom to the back alleys and rooftops
You might also like[Verse 4: Fredro Starr]
Ayo it's real in the hood, blood spills by the liters
You can run to the store, get killed for Adidas
Why I keep more guns than Gilbert Arenas
Four-five or ninas, like I fill with heaters
Rather be on stage rockin' filled up arenas than
Stuck in the hood, fiends still trying to beat us
Hardcore bitches catch chills when they meet us
Overcrowded jail cells fill with repeaters [?]

[Verse 5: Sicknature]
Sicknature throw a party (where)
Out the window like ""Get the fuck out!""
Snowgoons, frost giants, show 'em what Ragnarok 'bout
Party turns independent, fuck a piece of crap at the major
We'll have your fucking ass on a stick like Vlad the Impaler
Industry rapper acting like puppets on chloroform
Call yourself monsters, you nothing but muppets and pokemon
Ya ain't spooky, my legacy tunes is killer cold fruity
Not even ten global warmings could melt the Snowgoonies

[Verse 6: Punchline]
I'll bring forth a legacy for y'all to remember me
Deposit made to the bank of your memory
Attitude fuck the world like Ron Jeremy
Add to the fact that I need sex therapy
Era be etched in stone Face unknown
I'm famous, for breathing life to the microphone
Metaphors and rhymes, hard on my grind
On my tombstone write the greatest of all time
[Verse 7: REKS]
My name REKS, I bear the flag for the bottom of the bottle
The gone and forgotten brothers million man marching
I'm a marksmen, show off darts and red category
Add up all these rappers you'll be hard pressed to rep before me
Pawns be birthed in the laboratory
Somewhere in the M.A.-chaching, chaching-assachusetts
As you choose who you in the booth with, be wary of me
Momma named me Cory, but you can call me Ruthless

[Verse 8: Thirstin Howl III]
Yeah yeah. Thirstin Howl the mother fucking third, on a Snowgoons tune (ha ha)
I'm the double-L, general, heaven, hell
Wedding bells, wear it well
Thirstin Howl, not no Gilligan shit
Never had a deal but I'm still in this bitch
Brownsville stripes, earned every one
Puerto Rican, sleepin', same cemetery Pun
Big vig low, crazy catalogue
My main bitch pussy say Made in Panama

[Verse 9: Planetary]
Planetary, ATOP shit
OuterSpace, this is how it feels when the heat hit
Snowgoons shit, beats make the moon split
Even though the sun gonna shine when I move quick
I'm a living legacy that's heavily influenced
By the evils set through the tones of my music
I don't give two shits, y'all just irrelevant
This is my house we pulling guns for the settlement
[Verse 10: Virtuoso]
In a rhyme cipher, you're futile like a blind sniper
I'll strike like a typewriter, hot shit like a fried diaper
In my dynasty, my legacy spread vaginas and dead MC's
Next level trees like forests that cover Lebanese
Border scorching devil weed Roll a gram and smoke this shit
Ignore the rebels, bleed slower than Milošević
You know me bitch, oh you don't, well who am I?
Virtuoso, supersized, flow thee foes euthanized

[Verse 11: Maylay sparks]
Mezzanine, through hawk eyes with Belgian beers and corkscrews
Grey goose spilled on my suede shoes, y'all fake dudes
Slaughter rap, broad street bully green a quarterback
Talk slick three hundred yards quick like Mike Vick
White kicks, tattoos drink pierce from ice picks
Might flip when trying to take the mic from my tight grip
The 'goons and Maylay Sparks, black attack, Guiness harp [?]
Iron swords hover over mixing board to keep it sharp

[Verse 12: Swann]
A young adolescent searching for a dream, willing to succeed
By any means taken every step to be seen
Every lyrics stronger than a blast
To be remembered when I'm gone, living legacy forever-lasting
This pen and paper got me through the hard times
Because of how I rhyme I'm ripping out, rocking, acting out of line
Divine style got you right to a T
If you ain't with us underground, stay the fuck out the scene

[Verse 13: Sav Kills]
Divine styler, whiler, rhyhme skills get fouler
Mic profiler, lights out and sessions out ya
Performers, I enter the stage they scream louder
Embrace the mic, I'm seein the sea they scream shout ya
Stadiums, Palladiums, Snowgoons who fating them
This from the essence, from the ground up we blazin' them
From the slums and the ghettos where they raised us from
We fan glorious, the crowd, we amazing them

[Verse 14: M-Dot]
Hot like a ghetto get to live in the [?]
Spit a rhetoric metaphor sentiments lifting your tenements
Residents feath'rin' senators, I menace and I reddit
My hand scrolls the evidence, my pen flawless excellence
You're the tiny little ittl bittle, find the fiddle
Mind is brittle, crime biddles, my rhymes define the riddle, middle
Name, Dot, first name Man, metal
Hit you, press rewind, Snowgoons bless the mind

[Verse 15: Reef the lost cauze]
Yeah, and the rest is mine
They needed a hero and I'm just in time, I'm a monster on them drums
The father to you crumbs, it's brotherhood
Snowgoons, godfathers to my son
Let the gats burst, I react first, these rappers lust to get their wax worth
But their wack verse only equals what the raps worth
Now wipe that smirk off your ugly fucking face before I smack earth
Wind, fire, empires, we build quietly
It's snowgoons forever, rise high as the sky should be
The legacy survives by me
Your favourite MC in here and that's who the fuck I should be
Keep your eyes on me, cause when my brothers decide it's beef I'm the guy who squeezed
Die violently, I fucking hate y'all publicly and privately

A horse can out run a motor car
If the wheels are rubber and the rails are steel
That beast can outrun any automobile
Here's the story of progress and all the bullets they spent
On a sheet hung up in a circus tent
There's a lantern shining - it's pointing the way
This kind man has probably had his day
But they keep him around with his last vain hope
For selling tickets while spinning a rope
They brought him down off the vanishing trail
But nobody these days wants to hear his tale
So he spends his nights leaning up at the bar
The real gone cowboy with the fake tin star
Up on the screen there's a boy half his age
They pay him 20 times his weekly wage
For dodging phony bullets and catching blunt blades
For blowing up horses and kissing young maids
Children cheer
Women throw flowers
Men just glower
Up at the screen
But they don't know
Just what it means
Vengeance and dreams
Girls just swoon at the mention of him
With his face all powdered and his immaculate brim
And his hair pomaded and his fingernails clean
While old men whisper ""Just look at him preen""
And outside muttering through a cheap cigar

Towards destruction, you spiralin' like helix, wipe them teardrops
Chasin' stars in your eyes, playin' games with your lives
Now the wives is widows, soakin' up pillows, weepin' like willows
Still more blacks is dyin', 'cause they live and they tryin'
""How to Make a Slave"" by Willie Lynch is still applyin'
Regardless, Mos is one of my closest partners
Rockin' ever since before Prince was called The Artist
Rockin' before Funkmaster Flex was rockin' Starter
When 'Pac and Biggie was still cool, before they was martyrs
Life or death, if I'm choosin', with every breath I'm enhancin'
Stop, there comes a time when you can't run

What?
Lyrically handsome, call collect a king's ransom
Jams I write soon become the ghetto anthem
Way out like Bruce Wayne's mansion, move like a Phantom
You'll talk about me to your grandsons
Cats who claimin' they hard be mad fags
So I run through 'em like flood water through sandbags
Competition is mad, what I got, they can't have
Sinkin' they ship like Moby Dick to Ahab
Son, I'm way past the minimum, enterin' millennium
My raps will hold a gat to your back like Palestinians
Ancient Abyssinian, sure to hold the Gideon
Official b-boy gentlemen, long term, never the interim
Born inside the winter, when? Day after December 10
These simpletons — they mentionin' the synonym for feminine
Sweeter than some cinnamon, the Danish rings by Entenmann's
Rush up on adrenaline, they get they asses sent to them
(Gentlemen!) You got a tenement? Well, then assemble it!
Leave your unit tremblin' like herds of movin' elephant
Intelligent embellishment, follow for your element
From Flatbush settlement, skin possesses melanin
Hotter than tales of crack peddlin'
Makin' 'em WOOP like blue gelatin, swing like Duke Ellington
Broader than Barrington Levy, believe me
The hot Apache red who burned down your chief teepee
You see me?

So what I was gonna tell you was—
Love you Barbra!
Thank you honey. 

In 1967, some of you remember, may have been even there, I did a concert in Central Park. And that show gave me such stage fright because I forgot the words to one of my songs. And it, it so frightened me that I didn't return to the concert stage, as some of you know, for twenty-seven years, on New Year's Eve 1994. Thank you. But I wanted to challenge myself, you know, to see if I could do it, face the fear. And when that tour was done I said to myself, that's it, you know, no more. 

But then I found from time to time that I was drawn back to the concert stage because you guys really make it very gratifying for me, you really do. Thanks. 

You're the best!
Don't get hoarse. 

Anyway, if I've learned anything, it's to never say never. Because it ain't over 'til the fat lady sings and I ain't that fat. 

You're gorgeous. 
Thank you. 
You're still hot, Barbra. 
Oh, that was a good one! I like that one. That was very good. 

Anyway, life goes by so fast, doesn't it? You know, one minute you're a child. The next you're a teenager. The next you're a parent.
